<h1 class="c1">The BROWSER project</h1>

<p>What comes next after the classic Unix environment variables
<code>PAGER</code>, <code>MAILER</code>, and
<code>EDITOR</code>?</p>

<p>This is the <code>BROWSER</code> project page -- an effort to
promulgate a convention for expressing your browser preference to
programs which must call browsers to view URLs. Nowadays many
programs must do this; mailer user agents and on-line help systems
are just two of the most obvious application classes.</p>

<h1>How BROWSER works:</h1>

<p>The value of BROWSER may consist of a colon-separated series of
browser command parts. These should be tried in order until one
succeeds. Each command part may optionally contain the string "%s";
if it does, the URL to be viewed is substituted there. If a command
part does not contain %s, the browser is to be launched as if the
URL had been supplied as its first argument. The string %% must be
substituted as a single %.</p>

<p>Rationale: We need to be able to specify multiple browser
commands so programs obeying this convention can do the right thing
in either X or console environments, trying X first. Specifying
multiple commands may also be useful for people who share files
like .profile across multiple systems. We need %s because some
popular browsers have remote-invocation syntax that requires it.
Unless %% reduces to %, it won't be possible to have a literal %s
in the string.</p>

<p>For example, on most Linux systems a good thing to do would
be:</p>

<pre>
BROWSER="netscape -raise -remote \"openURL(%s,new-window)\":lynx"
</pre>

<h1>Who observes this convention?</h1>

<p>In the near future, any Python program that uses the
standard-library webbrowser.py module. This module, which debuted
in Python 2.0, was taught how to interpret <code>BROWSER</code> in
CVS on 23 Jan 2001, and will be released in Python 2.1a2.</p>

<p>On 24 Jan 2001, a <code>BROWSER</code> <a
href="urlview.patch">patch</a> against the 0.9 version was sent to
the maintainers of <a
href="ftp://ftp.mutt.org/pub/mutt/contrib/">urlview</a>.</p>

<p><!-- me@mutt.org, roessler@does-not-exist.org -->
 On 24 Jan 2001, a <code>BROWSER</code> <a
href="browse-url.patch">patch</a> was sent to the maintainer of the
browser-launch code in GNU Emacs.</p>

<p><!-- fx@gnu.org -->
 On 24 Jan 2001, a <a href="environ.patch">patch</a> against the
environ(5) man page was sent to Andries Brouwer, the Linux man page
maintainer, adding <code>BROWSER</code> to the set of documented
environment variables. Andries merged in an edited version within
hours.</p>

<p><!-- aeb@cwi.nl -->
 On 25 Jan 2001, Pavel Roskin told me "I hope to be able to
implement $BROWSER support in xpdf but I cannot promise it."</p>

<h1>What still needs to be done?</h1>

<p>Key people in the Perl and Tcl communities (including Larry
Wall) have agreed that it would be a good thing for the URL-viewing
facilities in their language libraries to interpret
<code>BROWSER</code>, but this has not been done yet.</p>

<p>If you implement <code>BROWSER</code> support somewhere, please
let me know for this page.</p>
