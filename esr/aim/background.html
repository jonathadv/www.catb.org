<p>I have been active in the weblog community since May 2002.  For
five months after that I listened to and participated in the debate
over anti-terror policy that has been a central concern of that
community since 9/11.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that I detected a number of recurring themes 
and stances in that debate, an emerging consensus, that could not 
adequately be subsumed within conventional political categories;
not least because one of those themes was the extent to which the
institutions and sages of conventional politics have failed us.</p>

<p>Symbolic of all this was the invention of the term "idiotarian" and
its rapid propagation through the blogosphere.  The implicit meaning
of the term was clear from the beginning; it was a condemnation
directed both at the dogmatic Right and the doctrinaire Left, both of
which proved so preoccupied with their own parochial concerns and
historical baggage that they neither anticipated the monstrous threat
of Islamo-fascist terrorism nor were able to come to grips with its
implications after the fact.</p>

<p>The aftermath of 9/11 seems certain to wreak tectonic changes on
the map of U.S. and world politics.  It has already motivated one
full-scale war, probably the first of several.  U.S. and Western
foreign policy are, of necessity, shifting in a neo-imperialist
direction.  In the realm of ideas, left-wing postmodernism has been
exposed as a form of apologism for atrocities; right-wing isolationism
has been shown inadequate to cope with asymmetrical warfare; and the
very notion that state action is a sufficient defense against terror
is being questioned in places that would before 9/11 have dismissed
the relevance of citizen militia with contempt.</p>

<p>The <a href="index.html">Anti-Idiotarian Manifesto</a> is my
attempt to put my skills as a rhetorician and propagandist at the
service of the war against terror.  The age-old struggle between those
who build and those who can only destroy is with us again; by
distilling the moral and pragmatic arguments that were hammered out in
the blogosphere during 2002, I hope to help as many as possible of the
fractious interest groups within our civilization find common cause in
the struggle against barbarism, and to take pride in that
struggle.</p>

<p>I posted five drafts on my weblog, <a
href="http://www.ibiblio.org/esrblog//">Armed and Dangerous</a>,
and benefitted from over 200 comments and emails.  I am grateful to
too many people to be named here. Though I elected to be the
focus of this effort, I think the result should be considered a
collaborative work of the blogosphere.</p>

<p>There is, however, one bit of personal invention in the manifesto.
Previous definitions of `idiotarianism' have been implicit and
extensional, requiring the reader/hearer to construct a model from
examples. I have attempted to supply an intensional definition.  I
hope this will be useful in framing future debate.</p>

<p>December 2003 update, version 2.0: Following the liberation of Iraq
and the capture of Saddam Hussein, I have deleted a paragraph about
Iraq that victory has made obsolete.</p>
