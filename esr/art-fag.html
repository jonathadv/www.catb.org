<p>If you are reading this, you probably objected to my use of the
phrase <a href="html-hell.html">cooler-than-thou art fags</a> on
the <a href='http://www.catb.org/~esr/html-hell.html'>HTML Hell page</a>..</p>

<p>I learned the phrase from my brother, an art student, who
reports that heterosexual art students use it of each other without
any intended offense to gays.</p>

<p>You may be thinking of objecting to it or asking me to change
it. If so, you have an excessive case of political correctness, aka
offensensitivity. My suggestion to you is: get over yourself.</p>

<p>I am offended by people who try to change or control my language
in the name of anybody's victimology theory or identity politics.
Therefore, you will get nowhere asking me to change it -- in fact,
I have come to regard retaining it as a free-speech issue.</p>

<p>If this still bothers you, don't bother denouncing me as a
homophobe or with any of the other handy slurs people routinely use
in Orwellian efforts to try to manipulate common vocabulary for
political gain. I know I'm not one -- and if you try to stuff me in
that box, I will simply write you off as an idiot.</p>

<p>Have a nice day.</p>
