<div id="Content">

<p>As this is written in early 1996, I have no reason to doubt that
I will be active on the Internet and maintaining my Web pages for
another fifty years. On the other hand, I could be hit by a truck
tomorrow.</p>

<p>This page is an effort to make sure that my network service
projects outlive me, by designating successors to take over as many
of them as possible. In many cases there are natural choices among
people already associated with the project. In others, people have
explicitly volunteered to step in should I become unavailable. By
announcing my intentions here, I hope to minimize any continuity
and succession problems.</p>

<p>If you're reading this and I'm alive and whole, and you have any
kind of special tie to one of my projects, please consider
volunteering to be my successor on it. Chances are you won't have
to do anything for a good long time.</p>

<p>If you're reading this and have solid reason to believe that I'm
out of the game and the designated successors listed here don't
know it, please email them all and ask them to re-read this page
and take appropriate action.</p>

<p>I designate John Cowan, <a
href="mail:cowan@ccil.org">&lt;cowan@ccil.org&gt;</a> to be my
virtual executor. John has the authority to coordinate whatever
actions are needed to dispatch my projects into safe hands.</p>

<dd>Ownership may be assumed by Chester County InterLink.</dd>

<dt><strong>The Jargon File</strong></dt>

with Guy Steele's consent to John Cowan or a third party agreeable
to both.</dd>

<dt><strong>The Retrocomputing Museum</strong></dt>

<dd>Curatorial rights and privileges, and ownership of the Museum
web page, are to pass to the present co-curator of the Museum, John

<dt><strong>The ncurses project</strong></dt>

<dd>Please notify the ncurses list <a

<dd>Backup maintainers are designated on the <a
href="fetchmail">fetchmail home page</a>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>All my other projects and FAQs will be up for grabs. If you want
to claim control of one, send mail to my virtual executors. They'll
arbitrate between conflicting claims, arrange the transfer, and
flag the project claimed.</p>

<p>Additional instructions for executors: Please add appropriate
notice, pointing to this page, to the top of my home page. Track my
condition (my designated next-of-kin is Catherine Olanich Raymond,
my wife, who can be reached at <a
href="mailto:ccolanich@cpmy.com">coraymond@cpmy.com</a> or care of
the firm of Christie, Pabarue, Mortensen &amp; Young in
Philadelphia). If I'm dead, move my pages to one of the Web
mausoleums after a suitable period.</p>
