<div id="preamble">
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Nothing beats an old-school tactile-clicky keyboard for typing feel,
durability, and classic engineering style.  A surface feature of this
kind of keyboard that contributes to the typing feel and durability is
a heavy and rigid case.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The center of any discussion of classic heavy keyboards is always the line of
development that ran from IBM beam-spring keyboards in the 1970s down
through the buckling-spring Model F and Model M in the 1980s
and 1990s to today&#8217;s Unicomps and the New Model F.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This document is a guide to recognizing, restoring, maintaining, and
modifying classic heavy keyboards. "Restoring" is prominent because the
type has not been manufactured in volume since cost pressure drove
them out of the market in the mid-1990s in favor of flimsier and
cheaper products.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This document was formerly the "Model M Troubleshooting FAQ", until it
got mission creep.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_background">Background</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_model_m">Model M</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Production of Model Ms began in 1985 and continues to the present day,
though spread across four different manufacturers and with major
fluctuations in volume and quality. The details are complex and best
summarized at its
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_M_keyboard">Wikipedia article</a>,
which the author of this FAQ helped fill out.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Troubleshooting and restoration of vintage Model Ms remains attractive
because, while the buckling-spring keyswitch is unchanged dince its
beginnings, relentless cost pressure led to a steady decrease in build
quality of the cases and structral backplates.  This decline was partly
reversed by Unicomp&#8217;s tooling refresh in 2020, but the old-style IBM
heavy case that is so valued by enthusiasts has not been returned to
production.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_model_f">Model F</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The very first buckling-spring keyboard, the Model M&#8217;s predecessor,
was the Model F, produced mainly from 1981 to 1985 and at much lower
volume until 1994. This was the keyboard attached to the original IBM
Personal Computer, the PC XT, and early versions of the PC AT. It is
nowadays referred to as the "XT keyboard", though it predated the XT.
The PC version had 83 keys (88 distinct switches); some industrial
versions had 122 keys.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Many buckling-springs enthusiasts consider the Model F variant of
the buckling-spring switch to be superior to the Model M&#8217;s; the
actuation force is lower and the tactility a bit crisper.  Despite
this, vintage model Fs are in much less use today than Ms. Fewer
were produced, fewer have survived, and the pre-ANSI layout is
offputting to a lot of potential users.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Model F Labs will sell you a
<a href="https://www.modelfkeyboards.com/">hand-crafted recreation of the Model
F</a> with a somewhat more modern ANSIfied layout.  While it is
eye-wateringly expensive, it speaks USB natively and almost no
interoperability issues have been reported with modern hardware.
(I&#8217;ve heard of one sporadic failure to initialize connecting to Windows.)</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_beam_spring_keyboards">Beam-spring keyboards</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Before the Model F, the beam spring.  Very few of these survive, and
this FAQ cannot yet say much about troubleshooting and restoring them
beyond reporting on some known issues and failure modes.  Watch this

<div class="paragraph"><p>The most common single type is the 1391401, which shipped with the IBM
PS/2 beginning in 1987.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>More details on generations 1-4 can be found under "Generations"
<a href="https://deskthority.net/wiki/IBM_Enhanced_Keyboard">here</a>. Note that
the earliest Generation 4 variants were shipped by Lexmark and are not
represented in the table above.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There were many iterations of the Model M controller board.  They
can be told apart by the number of ribbon cables running from the
keyboard membrane.  Membranes and controllers from different
generations are not compatible.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The initial design had three ribbon connectors with 16 column, 8 row,
and 4 LED pins. These were used on all 101- and 102-key Model Ms
before 1991, and continued to ship on some keyboards into the early
1990s.  These controllers exposed an SDL jack on the back of the case,
and had through holes that mate to plastic pegs to either side of the
opening for the jack.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Around 1993 Lexmark switched to fixed cables and occluded the jack
opening with a plastic shim that locked to a strain reliever on the
cable, which was internally wired to a cheaper Molex connector.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>At some point in the early 1990s the 16-8-4 arrangement of the connectors
changed to two connectors with 16 row pins and 12 column plus LED
pins.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The final variant, first shipped in 1995 and still being made today by
Unicomp, had no ribbon cables at all.  In these, a small PCB with
integrated LEDs sat just below the lock light panel with connectors on
it touching the membrane, replacing the larger PCB that formerly sat
behind the backplate or was bolted to it.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Aficionados refer to the small PCB as the "press-fit controller".
It has a known problem that the plastic pegs holding down the
contact surface on the PCB tend to degrade and snap off in 5-7
years. This makes the keyboard unsalvageable and good only as
a parts donor.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>M122s use a controller with 20- and 8-pin membrane connectors.
Controller boards for these are not interchangeable with any of the
previous varieties.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Up until Unicomp, the physical dimensions of the M were normally
19.3" (48.9 cm) x 8.2" (20.8 cm) x 1.9" (4.9 cm).  Some variants such
as 122s and Space Savers differed.  Unicomp Ms have smaller, lighter
cases.  The New Model M is 17.9" = 45.5cm x 7.5" = 19.0cm x 196" =
5.0cm).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Until some time in the Unicomp period (after 2001) cases and keys were
both PBT.  Unicomp retained PBT keys but the cases became an
ABS/polycarbonate blend.</p></div>

<h3 id="_model_f_2">Model F</h3>

<h3 id="_beam_spring">Beam spring</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Surviving examples of beam-spring keyboards are extremely rare,
enough so that I have not been able to gather systematic information
on identifying them. A Google Images search for "beam-spring keyboard"
does yield images of several relatively common types.  Many of the
survivors were built for either the Displaywriter or the 3278 and
5250-series terminals.</p></div>

<h2 id="_disassembly_and_reassembly">Disassembly and reassembly</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Before disassembling any of these keyboards it&#8217;s a good idea to
search the web for restoration videos to see how it&#8217;s done.
Links to some of the better ones can be found in the <a href="#references">[references]</a> near
the end of this FAQ.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Take pictures before disassembling, especially if the keyboard has
a layout anything other than bog-standard ANSI.  You want to be able
to put the keycaps back on correctly&#8230;</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>One thing to be careful of during reassembly of either an M or an F,
before you start re-inserting keys: check carefully that no spring is
caught over the edge of its barrel.  If you try reinserting a key with
the spring caught like that, you will crush and deform the spring,
ruining it.  Then you&#8217;ll have to take the board back apart and replace
the flapper, which is a huge pain.</p></div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_model_m_3">Model M</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Once the case is removed, a Medel M has four layers.  The topmost is a
plastic barrel plate. Underneath it are the switch flappers; they sit
on top of a thin mat and two layers of sensor membranes. Beneath those
is a metal backplate that provides structural support.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>One special tool is required for disassembling all model Ms prior to
Unicomp&#8217;s "New Model M" reissue in late 2020 - a 5.5mm (7/32in, metric
M3) socket hex driver with walls thin enough to fit in the screw wells
of the case.  Some of the recent Unicomps with "Ultra" slimline cases
have the screw heads more exposed, but a thin-wall tool is still what
you need to get past the case shoulders near them.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Note that while these screws look like generic PC case screws, they&#8217;re
not - they&#8217;re actually #6 sheet-metal screws designed to self-tap into
screw holes that were not molded with threads. The drivers for them are
a common tool in the radio-controlled-airplane hobby. A web search for
"5.5mm hex driver" turns up many sources.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The Unicomp New Model M (both full-sized and SSK "Space Saver
Keyboard" variants) dispenses with the 5.5mm screws in favor of
Pozidriv screws (a variant of Philips). You&#8217;ll need a Pozidriv #1
screwdriver to work them.</p></div>
<div class="admonitionblock">
<table><tr>
<td class="icon">
<div class="title">Warning</div>
</td>
<td class="content">The kind of ribbon sockets the Model M uses are only rated
for 10 insertions before the finish on the contacts might wear to the
point when they no longer establish a good conductive path for the
signal.  Worse than that, the ribbon ends get significant wear on each
insertion; if you put them through too many you might make them
unusable too.  It might be possible to repair damaged ribbon ends
with a conductive-ink pen, but better to avoid that.</td>
</tr></table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>So, minimize ribbon removal and insertion operations as much as
possible. This is actually a good reason to store your parts donor keyboards
intact rather than disassembling them into parts.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_model_f_3">Model F</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Once the case is removed, a Model F has six layers.  There&#8217;s a
perforated metal front plate through which the switch barrels protrude, a thin
rubber mat, the switch barrels and flappers, the PCB, an insulating
sheet of plastic, and a metal backplate.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>On an F XT, the controller electronics sit on a peninsula of the PCB
holding the capacitative sensor pads.  On some Fs, notably including
the 3178, the controller electronics are on a daughterboard connected
to the PCB by ribbon cables.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I have restored one 1984 Model F XT that had hex-head sheet metal
case screws looking exactly like Model M screws, but a half-millimeter
larger and requiring a 0.25in hex driver.  They&#8217;re very similar to
#10 sheet metal screws, but with a longer shaft than those have.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I have seen video evidence of other screw sizes on F122s. All
have hex heads; if you&#8217;re going to restore those you probably want
a full nut-driver set.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Beware of trying to remove the spacebar on Model Fs - don&#8217;t force it
if you feel resistance! On early versions you actually have to
separate the front and back plates before it can be done without
risk of snapping the clips that hold the spacebar to its stabilizer
wire.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><a href="https://deskthority.net/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=24967">This Deskthority
thread</a> is about a mod to the F spacebar you can do that will prevent
this problem.  Use something like a jewelry file or even the kind of
emory board made for filing fingernails; shave material off gradually
until you reach a point where the clip can be rotated into place
without forcing it&#8230;</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To get the fore- and back-plates apart you need to get the top one to
move sideways so it disengages from the locking tabs on the bottom
plate. Some variants have an odd-shaped tab near one corner
that needs to be bent outward slightly first.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The best way I&#8217;ve found to get the top plate loose is to stand the
sandwich on end tap one end of the top plate lightly with a hammer.
Hold the the plates together with your other hand while you do this,
because when they separate all the switch flappers will unseat and
fall out.  It&#8217;s better to remove them when the top plate has been
returned to a horizontal position so you don&#8217;t risk losing any.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You may want to separate the spacebar flapper from the others and
make sure you use it for the spacebar on reassembly, as it tends
to wear a little differently from the other keys.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Reassembly begins with placing the mat on the upcurved side of the
front plate. If you didn&#8217;t choose to do the spacebar mod, here are the
steps you need to do next:</p></div>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>
Begin by supporting the long sides of the front plate on a couple
  of pieces of half-inch-thick scrap wood (or something similar) so
  that when you install the flappers there won&#8217;t be pressure on the
  springs and barrels to push them up and out of the openings in the
  front plate.  Turn the plat mat-side up - it should be convex
  towards you.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Before placing any of the other barrels or flappers, begin by
  removing the stabilizer wire from the spacebar barrel piece if
  it&#8217;s not already loose.  If it isn&#8217;t, take note of the way it&#8217;s
  caught under two small lugs near either end.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
With the spacebar slot nearest you, insert the spacebar barrel
  piece through its three holes. Choose the orientation that puts the
  barrel opening further from the nearest plate edge and you.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Insert the spacebar up underneath the front plate, pushing its legs
  through the three holes in the spacebar barrel piece.  Orient it so
  the left-hand and right-hand slots to hold the spring ends open face
  away from the nearest plate edge and you.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Wedge something undeneath the spacebar to put it in a fully depressed
  position, projecting the three plastic legs through the spacebar
  barrel piece as far towards you as possible.  You&#8217;re doing this for
  easier access to the stabilizer retention slots on the left- and
  right-hand legs.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The spacebar stabilizer wire is not vertically symmetrical.  You
  want the slight V in it shaped to point downwards, towards the
  front plate.  Pointed in the other direction (upward) it would
  interfere with tye spacebar flapper too much to let it seat.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Examine the spacebar underpiece carefully. The inner wall of the
  square well for each outer leg ends in a small overhanging lug
  (previously mentioned); locate these.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
During this next three steps it helps to be holding the stabilizer wire
  vertically, at a 90-degree angle to the front plate.  Insert one
  end of the stabilizer wire into one of the slots on an outer leg.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Snap the nearest corner of the stabilizer wire into the small lug
  nearest the wire end you just inserted in its slot. This will help
  prevent that spring end from popping out doring the next few steps.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Then maneuver the other wire end into the other slot. Snap its
  corner into the corresponding lug
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The stabilizer wire should now be lying flat against the barrel
  piece, clearing the hole for the spacebar flapper. Reach underneath
  to press and release the spacebar a couple times; the travel should
  feel normal ans smooth.  If it doesn&#8217;t, you may have the stabilizer
  wire inverted.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Wedge the something between the spacebar and front plate to keep
  the spacebar in the most open position you can get it to
  assume. You need to do this so the spavcenar flapper will seat
  properly.  Poster putty or folded and refolded cardboard will
  do for this
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Drop the spacebar flapper into place. Note that the spacebar
  stabilizer wire has to go between the flapper and the spacebar
  barrel piece, not between the flapper and the PCB when it would
  prevent the flapper from making contact.
</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgIkM2_Ns4U">This video</a> has
good footage of installing the XT spacebar at about 11:50 in.
Note that he also installs an internal TMK converter - more about this
under <a href="#conversion">[conversion]</a>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>After getting the spacebar in place this you can proceed to installing
the other barrels and flappers.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You&#8217;ll find the spacebar flapper doesn&#8217;t want to seat properly because
there isn&#8217;t enough room for the spring in the well created by the
little feet on the spacebar&#8217;s central post.  The best tool to solve
this with is a thin wooden wedge about the size and shape of a
doorstop.  Insert the wedge between the spacebar and the front plate
(being careful not to collide with the flapper spring!)  Push on the
wedge to gradually pry the spacebar away from the front plate until
the spring has enough room in thw well that the flapper can seat
evenly with the others.  Leave the wedge in place until you have the
backplate secured.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Reassembling the plates without disturbing the flappers and barrels
takes some delicacy.  Lay the back plate down on top of the front
plate, avoiding any sideways motion and letting the locking tabs on
the front plate protrude through the cutouts in the back plate.
Carefully apply six carpenter&#8217;s spring clamps around the plate edges
to hold the sandwich together tightly enough that the flippers and
barrels can&#8217;t shift around.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>It&#8217;s a good idea to put the keycaps on and test your keyboard at this
point, <strong>before</strong> you reengage the locking tabs, when you can easily
reseat any flappers that need it just by unclamping the backplate. But
if you find a key that isn&#8217;t responding, try removing and reinserting
the keycap before concluding that the flapper needs an intervention.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To finish reassembly, position a trigger clamp with a 24-inch throw so
that one jaw is on a front-plate end and the other on the opposite
back-plate end.  There are two different combinations like this; you
know you have the right one when compressing the clamp drives the
edges of the back-plate cutouts under the locking tabs.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To put the plate assembly back in the case, turn cover (the upper case half)
upside down and support its edges with pieces of scrap wood or books
or other things a half-inch or so thick.  Your objective is to leave
room for the keycaps not to touch your worktable when you place the
plate assembly in it.  Which is what you do next.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There&#8217;s only one way for the plate assemply to fit, constrained by the
cutouts in the cover. Put the tabs on the front edge of the pan (the case
bottom half) in corresponding slots in the inner wall of the cover,
and let the pan rest on the backplate.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There will be some tricky fiddling as you position the cable strain
relief in its exit notch and hang the ground washer on the nearby case
screw. The most important thing to understrand is that the pan is
dsigned to bow out slightly and be under tension when the case is
closed.  That tension is what holds the plate assembly in place.</p></div>
</div>

<h2 id="_cleaning">Cleaning</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Grubby keycaps can be effectively cleaned by popping them off with the
tip of a butter knife (or you can be fancy and use a keypuller),
dropping them in a glass of lukewarm water, adding denture cleaner or
dishwashing soap, and letting them soak for a while.  Rinse and let
dry thoroughly before reinstalling.  Don&#8217;t use extremely hot water as
PBT begins to deform at around 66C = 151F - spacebars are the most
likely to get warped.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Despite some YouTube videos, I strongly recommend against throwing
your Model M or F in the dishwasher. It&#8217;s not uncommon for dishwashers
to have a main cycle temperature up to 170F, well above PBT
deformation temperature. Fully immersing the backplate is also risky
in other ways: (1) the factory sticker could be damaged, (2) random
bits of crud can get washed into the path of the switch flappers and
stuck there, (3) water on the PCB can lead to long-term corrosion
issues, and (4) the membrane contwct points can be corroded by the
moisture. Some of these problems might be prevented if you have access
to a vacuum dryer and can reliably boil off all the residual moisture
shortly after immersion, but I wouldn&#8217;t chance it myself.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Many Unicomps, including the New Model M and Mini-M, have cases made
from a ABS/polycarbonate blend rather than PBT.  The deformation
temperature will be slightly lower; the same caveats apply.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>While caps are off is a good time to blow out dust and hairballs
with a can of air or spray-painting compressor. For a really thorough
job, Q-tips can get down between the barrels.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Light rust on an F can be lifted off the metal fore- and back-plates
by moistening them with a cloth soaked in white vinegar and letting it
sit on the rust for a few minutes, then re-wiping with a clean rag. A
small wire brush of the kind used to clean stove burners is helpful
for stubborn spots. Where the plate is actually pitted, a bit of
scrubbing with steel wool can at least scour the rust out of the pits.
If you have access to a bench grinder (or even a Dremel tool) with a
wire brush, by all means use that.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If you have to disassemble an M or F entirely to deep-clean it, check
to see if it still has its surface coating - I&#8217;ve seen a Model F where
it was mostly gone.  If you&#8217;re looking at uncoated metal it&#8217;s not a
bad idea to paint the plates for rustproofing before you reassemble it
- I have used primer and industrial-grade enamel but I understand
Clearkote works well.  You must remove the PCB and the plastic
insulator sheet from the backplate before doing this to an F!</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I&#8217;ve restored one Model F that had a worse problem than rust: mold all
over the front and back plates. If your keyboard is functional but
smells nasty this may be the reason.  The same vinegar soak and
scrubbing that lifts rust will do for the mold. The mold stink, which
doesn&#8217;t come directly from molds or mold spores but is due to organic
volatiles excreted by the molds as they grow, is much more difficult
to eradicate. Vinegar and isopropyl alchohol looked promising for this
but didn&#8217;t do a thorough job, but I found an enymatic cleaner called
Moldzyme that does.  Rinse thoroughly afterwords as the Moldzyme can
be a bit pungent itself.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The case halves can be washed with warm soapy water.  Isopropyl
alcohol can be useful for going after serious stains.  Note that
removing or damaging the provenance label on the bottom of the case
will reduce the board&#8217;s value in case you ever want to sell it; you
may want to be careful of this when washing the bottom case half.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Be wary of inverting the keyboard with the buckling springs bared, as
they can occasionally fall out.  If this happens they can sometimes be
reinstalled by spearing them on a sharpened chopstick and twisting the
wire tip of the spring coil into its attachment point on the flapper.</p></div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_storage">Storage</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>If at all possible, don&#8217;t store M and F keyboards with the cable
insulation in contact with the case.  Given prolonged contact,
plasticizers in the cable can leach out and damage the case.
In all other ways model Ms and Fs are very stable in storage.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>While the the anodization on the back plate of Ms is very durable, the
surface coating on the fore and back plates of Fs is less so and they
have some tendency to rust out. Avoid exposing them to moisture,
especially salty moisture.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Beam-spring keyboards have metal cases and thus can&#8217;t be damaged by
plasticizers.  On the other hand, they have a known and serious
tendency to rust out internally over time, probably due to lack of
anti-corrosive coating on the metals. The caveat for Fs applies much
more strongly: do not expose these to moisture, especially salty
moisture.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Sterilite 28-quart/27-liter plastic storage boxes are well-suited
for storing Model Ms (and the slightly smaller Model Fs).  The
long dimension is 23" but they narrow to just enough more than 19"
at the bottom. Each will hold three keyboards, with some space
for cables.  The closed boxes stack.</p></div>

<h3 id="_philosophy">Philosophy</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Vintage buckling-spring and beam-spring keyboards are both tools and
collector&#8217;s items.  When restoring them, keep an eye on both roles.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Fortunately, they almost never cause a conflict. Collectors are very
tolerant - even approving - of changes to these keyboards that
increase either durability or utility (such as internal USB
conversions).  Beware, though, of irreversible case modifications;
those are frowned upon.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If you have an eye on value as a collectible, there are two major
things you can do: (1) Protect the provenance label, and (2) don&#8217;t
mix keycap types.  We&#8217;ll cover both issues later in this section.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The collector value of a high-quality restoration increases with the
age of the keyboard. Also with its mass, as the decreasing weight over
time affected the durability and feel and is considered an indicator
of progressive cheaping-out of the manufacturing.  In descending
order of value the categories are:</p></div>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic">

Really ancient square-badge Ms, and terminal Ms of any age (because

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_keycap_considerations">Keycap considerations</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Model M and Model F keycaps are interchangeable.  They can be
purchased new from Unicomp and Model F Labs; old stock is
often available on eBay.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Keycaps from the IBM/Lexmark area are of extremely high quality, as
are Unicomp keycaps from after their tooling refresh in 2020. If
you&#8217;re buying keycaps for restoration or taking them from a donor
keyboard, you may want to avoid Unicomp keycaps from between 2010 or
so and 2020; during that period increasingly worn tooling produced
defects like uneven heights, slightly blurry edges, and legends a bit
out of place.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>When restoring, be aware of the difference between one-piece and
two-piece keycaps. IBM Model Ms from before the Lexmark spinout in
1991 had two-piece keycaps, with an inner shell intended to ride on
and protect the buckling spring supporting a keytop (sometimes called
an overlay) that could carry variable legends and be specialized for
particular applications.  As time went on and GUI interfaces made
keycap overlays comparatively less useful, Lexmark and (later) Unicomp
sought cost savings by producing single-piece keycaps.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Generally speaking it&#8217;s bad form (and reduces the value of the
keyboard) when a restorer mixes types.  An M should have either all
two-piece or all one-piece keycaps, and which it carries should be
appropriate to its year of mamufacture - notably, this means all Model
Fs, and all Model Ms from before 1991, should always be restored with
two-piece keycaps.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Simplifying matters, some large keys (especially large keys with
stabilizer wires) were one-piece even before the Lexmark spinout:
Spacebar, both Shift keys, Caps Lock, Enter, Backspace, the numpad
large +, and the numpad -.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>As shipped, two-piece caps usually had shells matching the keytop
background color.  A really high-quality restoration preserves this
property on a keybopard that has it, even though it is normally
invisible.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Almost all Model M, F and beam-spring keycaps are made from PBT and
will not yellow with age. Very occasionally you will encounter
spacebars that were cast from ABS and have yellowed.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retr0bright">Retr0bright</a> will fix that
up. Alternatively, Unicomp can sell you a PBT spacebar that will fit
an M or F.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_model_m_4">Model M</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If lock lights fail to flash on power-up, you probably have a dead
controller board.  It is possible to replace these; see the discussion
of controller modding later in this document.  You may be able to buy
a replacement 4th-generation "press-fit" controller from Unicomp.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I have seen cases in which the controller was OK but the LEDs are
dead.  This is unusual, but if yoou get keystroke echo</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Partial failure is usually due to the plastic rivets securing the
back plate to the barrel plate becoming brittle and shearing off over
time.  See the disussion of bolt-modding later in this document for
details on how to fix this.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If any individual key is failing to register ior or doesn&#8217;t feel
right, the flapper is probaly stuck; that will mute all kets the whole
row and column it&#8217;s in.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Another mode of partial failure is due to damaged traces on the
membrane or membrane connectors.  This will usually take out an entire
row, but not an intersecting column the way a stuck flapper does. Of
course it is possible to have both row and column traces damaged
in whch these cases get tricky to distinguish.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Usually trace damage is due to liquids having been spilled on the
keyboard (the phosphoric acid in colas is especially harmful), though
I know of one case caused by vaping. Occasionally you hear reports of
applying a conductive-ink pen to repair breaks, but this isn&#8217;t a
long-term fix - the conductive ink degrades over time and it is likely
that your trouble will come back.  Unicomp sells replacement
membranes, including old stock for pre-4th-generation keyboards.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Cracks in the barrel plate are not uncommon and not usually a problem;
the rivets will do a good job of holding the pieces in place.  If you
are bolt-modding or doing any other procedure that isolates a barrel
plate, any adhesive that will take on plastic can be used to repair
small cracks; I have used Gorilla Glue with good results.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The factory label on the bottom of your M case may have been sealed
over with a protective plastic film at the factory.  If it hasn&#8217;t,
adding such protection is good idea - a removed or damaged label
reduces the value of the keyboard. To protect it, cut a rectangle
of wax paper to size. Position the wax paper on the label, cover it
with a larger swatch of transparent packing tape, then trim the
packing tape to size - 1/8" margin around the label is enough.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Damaged springs can be replaced without taking the plate assembly
entirely apart if you have a spare flapper you can raid for its
spring. Find a disposable chopstick and whittle the tip until you
can just manage to insert it in a flapper spring. Pull the old damaged
one up and out with a par of pliers. Spear the new one and shine a
good enough light into the barrel that you can see the spring peg on
the flapper. Push the news oring onto the peg and twiat it
counterclockwise. When you feel a catch in the rotation, twist it a
quarter-turn clockwise and gently withdraw the chopstick.  This
is actually easier than it sounds!</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_model_f_4">Model F</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If a Model F is totally unresponsive the control electronics are
dead. It is difficult to recover from this as they form a physical
unit with the curved board holding all the capactive sensors and there
is nowhere to buy a replacement for that.  In this case the best you
can do is keep the F as a parts donor.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Partial failure likely means some switch flappers need to be reseated
or there is debris blocking the path to the capacitive sensor pads.
You will have to disassemble the front and back plates to investigate.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>While the bottom case half of an F is metal, the top is a plastic that
is somewhat more brittle than the PBT of a Model M and (unlike the M)
prone to hairline cracks.  Additionally Fs have a painted or
powdercoated finish that can be damaged by rough handling.  When
acquiring Fs for restoration, inspect them carefully for these defects
as there aren&#8217;t any known remediations other than replacing the part
from a donor.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The Model F backplate is secured with metal locking tabs rather than
plastic rivets and thus never requires a bolt mod. However, it does
have a foam-rubber spacer mat which can degrade over time (more likely
if exposed to heat and moisture) and may need to be replaced.  A new
one is relatively easy to make from 2mm sheet foam with a blade and a
12mm hole punch; mats for some variants can be purchased from Model F
Labs.  In case Model F labs doesn&#8217;t have what you need in stock, here

<h2 id="_terminal_model_m_f_and_beam_spring_issues">Terminal Model M, F and beam-spring issues</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Some Model Ms (and Fs) were built for use with IBM terminal types
beginning with the IBM 3100 series and notably including the 5250.
You can spot terminal model Ms by the blank plastic panel at the upper
right where you would expect lock lights to be on a PC keyboard.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You might find them with either a standard 101-key or the 122-key
"battleship" layout.  The 122-key variants were associated with 3270
or 5250 terminals and are relatively easy to find; the 101-key layout
shipped with the 3151 and successors, and is rather rare.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>These terminals used a poorly documented variety of interface
connectors, notably including RJ-45 jacks and a 5-pin DIN that
resembles an AT connector but speaks a different protocol.</p></div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="240din.jpeg" alt="240-degree 50pin DIN" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Compare this image with the AT connector shown in the next section.
Note the square arrangement of the uppermost 4 pins.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Search for "RJ45 to USB Soarer&#8217;s Converter" on eBay for one
possible solution.  There&#8217;s a different variant of the Soarer&#8217;s
Converter you might find for the 5-pin DIN; the magic search term is
"240 Degree" describing the pin placement.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>At time of writing in 2021, there&#8217;s a particular eBay seller named
"orihalcon" who has a reputation in the keyboard-enthusiast community
for making and shipping well-built Soarer&#8217;s converters. Note that
there are at least three different variants of Soarer&#8217;s Converter and
make sure you get the right one.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Otherwise you are deep in the weeds trying to get one of these
working. One way is to get your hands on a pre-4th-generation
controller PCB that speaks PS/2 or AT and transplant it in - I&#8217;ve seen
this being done and it appears all versions of that PCB were very
sensibly designed to mount to the case in the same way.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>However: 122-key variants have a different matrix than 101-key
variants and export ribbon cables with a different connector count, 20
vs. 16.  Make sure your donor controller matches your ribbon cable.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Another option would be the Teensy. Model H, or Rump mods described
later in this document. All 101-key Model Ms before the 4th-generation
redesign used the same two (or three if there are lock lights) ribbon
connectors from the sensor membrane and can thus use the same mods.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Beam-spring terminals can only be made to work with modern computers

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph" id="power"><p>You may be able to plug your PS/2 Model M directly into a PS/2 port,
if your machine still has one.  But maybe not - a IBM or Lexmark Model
M draws more power (100-120mA) than some modern PS/2 ports are
designed to supply.  Nominally PS/2 pin 4 is supposed to ship +5 V DC
at 275 mA but a lot of later PS/2 implementations took advantage of
the low amperage requirements of more modern keyboards (3-50mA) amd
cheaped out on power management.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The high power draw remained true of older PS/2 Unicomp keyboards made
to the Model M design, which had the same core keyboard electronics as
late Lexmarks.  The main chips on these, the Motorola 6805 processor

<div class="paragraph"><p>You have two routes to recover.  One (if your Model M has a detachable

<h3 id="_boot_mode_problems">Boot-mode problems</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The UB HID standard describes two ways that keyboards can behave on
power-up. There is a normal "report mode" and "boot mode" which
interrupts the CPU every time the keyboard is polled; this is intended
to allow the BIOS to handle a USB keyboard in the absence of a
USB-aware operating system. USB keyboards are supposed to come up in
report mode, and be switched into and out of boot mode by your host
system&#8217;s BIOS.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Some (but not all) older Unicomp model Ms may not have correctly
responded to the control sequence telling them to drop into boot mode
mode.  Suspect this if yours won&#8217;t talk to a PC at boot time and has
to be unplugged/replugged to establish communication with the PCS&#8217;s
internal hub. Alas, there is no fix; the workaround is the
unplug/replug.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>We have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxT1ja8OWRY">one report</a> that
even the prototype SSK version of the New Model M (part number UB40E7A)
needs to be unplugged and replugged after boot.  Possibly this was
fixed in production versions; I have seen no such issue with my
full-sized production New Model M (UT40U4A).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>(The CY8C24493 the prototype SSK is using as a controller draws 250mA,
which is pretty high for a keyboard without RGB lights, but runs on
anything between 1.7v and 5.5v so this is definitely not an
undervoltage issue.)</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A subtler problem arises because some PC hubs fail to transmit the
command required to switch a USB keyboard in boot mode to normal mode
after boot.  If this does not occur, the keyboard will be limited to
6-key rollover rather than supporting the N-key rollover of
normal-mode USB.  This limit is never pushed by older model Ms, which
due to the way their sensor matrix is constructed are limited to 2KRO,
but may be an issue with the Unicomp Mini-M SSK which has a reworked
larger matrix with individual traces for the WASD cluster.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Alex Lustenberg reports "according to some accounts, the USB
controller in the unicomp isnt exactly USB compatible; undervoltage
within USB spec will cause it to not init properly"</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><a href="https://plus.google.com/110394678113306441540/posts/jB9pUGC9rU4">This
post</a> and its comments display some evidence that undervoltage
probably isn&#8217;t an issue, but a keyboard controller failure to
respond properly during the initialization sequence may be.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This theory is reinforced by experiments with two cheap hubs
containing the Terminus Manufacturing 4-port USB hub chip (1a40:0101)
and a hub containing a chip by Genesys Logic, Inc. (05e3:0608).  The
UB404LA fails to initialize on powerup connected to either of these,
but becomes visible when unplugged and replugged.  The UB40PGA
exhibits normal behavior.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I disassembled the UB404LA and found that the only chip in it is a
Cypress 24794 SOC (manufacturer data sheet
<a href="http://www.cypress.com/?mpn=CY8C24794-24LTXI">here</a>) sitting on a mini
PCB behind the LED panel that is wired to both the USB cable and the
keyboard proper.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I also disassembled the UB404PGA. There are two chips on the mini-PCB
in this one, an LM393 differential comparator and a CY763513-PVC
(data sheet <a href="http://www.datasheets.org.uk/CY7C6351-datasheet.html">here</a>).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The key point about these Cypress chips is that while they&#8217;re both USB
controllers they&#8217;re different SOCs; it could easily be that the USB
stage in the first is flawed but the second is not.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>We have a
<a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+SusanSons/posts/AiEadho2Vq4">report</a> that
flaky failures on a UB40B5A (the 122-key variant) were resolved by
plugging it into the sort of high-amperage USB2 port used to recharge
cellphones.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>On the other hand, the undervoltage theory gets a boost from one
Andrew Hutchings, who reports: "I&#8217;ve just come back from a micro
electronics lab where we have been testing [the Cypress 24794 SOC on a
Ruffian v2 board] and it seems the problem is to do with voltage.  If
the USB port is 4.9-5.0v it works fine, 5.1-5.2v the handshake does
not succeed."  A day later he said "We jury-rigged a TPS73150
regulator in front of the USB power input to the PCB.  It now works
perfectly on every PC and powered hub I have.  Not sure how permanent
a fix it is but it will do until I can buy a replacement PCB from
Unicomp."</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I can no longer recommend buying any of these older Unicomp models. The
New Model M appears to have solved the USB incompatibility issues of
older Unicomps. In addition, it is plainly visible from the finish
of the case and keycaps that they bought new tooling to produce these
and the build quality has gone way up.</p></div>

<h3 id="_cable_failure_due_to_nonexistent_strain_relief">Cable failure due to nonexistent strain relief</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>It has been reported in a comment attached to sa now vanished
G+ post that one UB4044A (Classic Black with no pointing device) has
exhibited intermittent USB disconnect issues which turned out to be
cable failure; there is no strain relief where the USB cable enters
the keyboard.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I have opened up the UB404LA and UB404PGA, both manufactured in
October 2012, and verified that there is no strain relief on the USB
cable.  It looks like this is a consistent design error across the
Unicomp USB line - up to and including the full-size New Model M -
that may account for a lot of problems. It&#8217;s inherited from the
fixed-cable Lexmark and IBM versions, which didn&#8217;t have strain relief
either.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>One product that does not have this issue is the narrow tenkeyless
(SSK) version of the New Model M. It has a USB A connector in the
rare locking variant on the keyboard chassis, and a cable that mates
with it And has a conventional Model A connector on the other end.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_power_usage">Power usage</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The UB404PGA reports 98mA draw and says it is "Bus Powered"; the
UB404LA reports 100mA draw and says it is "Self Powered".  The USB 2.0
spec allows a 500mA draw.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>On opening up these keyboards, I discovered that both use Cypress
programmable SOCs, replacing the 6805/8042 found on older Model Ms.
These are low-power chips that should have no issues drawing from
a USB 2.0 controller.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>On this evidence, I think the theory that the Unicomps still have the
Model M&#8217;s physical power-draw issues can be dismissed.  However, there
is evidence that some sort of logic error triggered by under-voltage
or under-amperage may have mimicked such problems in several Unicomp
models pror to the New Model M; refer to the previous section on
USB Unicomp issues for details.</p></div>

<h3 id="_bumper_modding">Bumper modding</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Despite the weight of the Model M, some case variants have a tendency
to skid around on a smooth desk surface, expecially on a glass-topped
desk. Serious typists can forestall this by applying stick-on rubber
or cork bumpers to the case bottom.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>On an M, there are two 5mm x 5mm square-shaped contact areas adjacent to
the wells that the fold-out feet sit in, and/or near the front corners

that size: search for "5mm square rubber feet".</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Model Fs ship with 4 cork feet that are disks 1" in diameter and 1/16"

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_bolt_modding">Bolt modding</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The Model M is a notoriously rugged device which routinely clocks in a
service life of over 30 years.  However, it has one known mechanical failure
mode. Its metal backplate is secured to the barrel plate holding the
keyswitches by a large number of plastic rivets protruding through
holes in the backplate.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Over decades these can degrade and break, affecting key feel and
in extreme cases rendering the device inoperable. You can tell this
is required if you hear rivet fragments rattling around when you shake
the keyboard.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Function can be restored with a procedure called a
<a href="https://wiki.geekhack.org/index.php?title=Modifications:IBM_Model_M:Nut_and_Bolt_Mod">bolt
mod</a> that replaces the rivets with bolts or screws.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There are two different ways to bolt-mod.  You can do it in-place ot
full-disassembly.  Either will require the following tools and supplies:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
5.5mm nut driver
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Hobby blade
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Dremel tool or cordless drill with 1/16 bit
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
4mm nut diver
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
#1 Phillips head screwdriver
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
M2 screws, 10mm, McMaster Carr 92005A033
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
M2 nuts, McMaster Carr 90592A004
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
M2 washers, McMaster Carr 93475A196
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There are helpful videos of the full-disassembly procedure on YouTube;
the best I&#8217;ve found is
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dStgzMpOTOA&amp;t=93s">this one</a>. To do his
procedure as described you will need one additional tool: a pair of
nail nippers.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You may prefer to trim off the rivet stubs with flush-cut nippers - I
found this worked better than nail nippers.  Those are cheap anywhere
that sells electrician&#8217;s tools.  Harbor Freight sells very inexpensive
"Micro Flush Cutters" that are an ideal size for this job.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Flexing the barrel plate to pry it loose risks cracking it.  Instead,
push out each of the the rivet stems with a screwdiver tip.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Note that keyfiender uses 8mm screws with a different McMaster Carr
part number; I&#8217;ve found these don&#8217;t leave enough room for both washer
and nut on some older Model Ms with thicker plates.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Rather than using 10mm screws, you can stick with keyfiender&#8217;s 8mm
screws (McMaster Carr part number 92005A029) but omit the washers. If
you omit the washers it&#8217;s a good idea to seal the nuts with Loctite -
use Loctite Purple so turning the nut with a hand tool can break the
adhesion when required without risking stripping the screws.  Best
to do this only when the keyboard is verified working.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There is also the screw mod, described some way down in
<a href="https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipOkRh4Wn0OBdTQppsHGt_hizKJ_D73hiwTTOsZsvn9ZJFifN0-klXLtLuJNfa2Axg?key=OENXSXY5NVk3alZDZ0dCcEMxR05kZHZtaFBqanN3">Bitten&#8217;s
Model M Restoration Megaguide</a>. I haven&#8217;t tried his self-tapping
screws.  I have used <a href="https://www.mcmaster.com/#90380A327">self-forming
screws</a>, driving in the screws from the backplate side.  This method
doesn&#8217;t require the nuts, but you will need the washers under the
screw heads on the plate side.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I shall at some point try this with M2 screws with a 3.5mm head width,
which should eliminate the need for washers entirely.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Keyfiender says that the row of rivers right near the low board edge
(where the spacebar is) don&#8217;t need screws, but diesn&#8217;t explain why.
Answer: if you have the rest of the plate assembly properly riveted,
that edge of the barrel plate won&#8217;t flex enough to natter.  Also
putting nuts on the barrel plate there interferes with how it sts in
the pan.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I recommend wearing a filter mask while drilling as the process
generates fine particulates that are not friendly to your lungs.
Also, getting 8 or so cheap 3-inch spring clamps and clamping them on
the edges of the plate assembly will ensure that when it&#8217;s inverted
on your work surface the springs protruding from the barrel plate
don&#8217;t drag and get damaged.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A subtle gotcha in full reassembly: It is normal for there to be one unfilled
barrel on an M101, which you might have missed if you weren&#8217;t paying
attention.  This is what the flappers should look like when
reassembling:</p></div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="flappers.jpg" alt="flappers.jpg" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Note where the unfilled barrel is at the lower right, between LAlt
and the spacebar.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In-place is the easier way.  Use it if you&#8217;re confident the sensor
membranes are clean and undamaged.  Simply invert your M and, without
dissassmbling it, drill out the holes from the backplate side.  Apply
bolts and nuts as you drill so the plate assembly never separates.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The one risk of the in-place mod is that if you don&#8217;t make clean
holes at an appropriate low-speed setting (15000rpm works well)
you may push fragments of plastic between the sensor membranes that
interferes with operation.  Test thoroughly; if you have unresponsive
kewys your fallback is to take out all the bolts, disassemble the
plates, and clean everything up before proceeding.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There turn out to be 48 bolt positions on my 1988 1391401.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Having done both in-place bolt mods and keyfiender&#8217;s full-disassembly
technique, I can report that you really want to de-burr the entry hole
for each screw, otherwise you&#8217;ll have a miserable time trying to get
them started. I inserted the point of a triangular hobby blade so both
edge and back contracted the edges of the hole, then twisted it around
applying light pressure.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Also, go easy on tightening the nuts and bolts.  The screws are not
particularly hard steel and their threads are very fine; it&#8217;s easy
to strip them by overtightening.  Even when you don&#8217;t strip the bolts,
if you tighten the down too much you can compress the plate
essembly enough to force some sensor locations permantly closed,
deadening sections of the keyboard or even the entire thing. If your
keyboard is unresponsive after a bolt mod, loosen it up.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I recommend the Picquic "Teeny Turner" for screwing in the bolts.  The
effect of the magnetic tip makes it easier to place the screws in
tight locations</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Dremel, Inc. sells a thing it calls a "WorkStation" that&#8217;s like a baby
drill-press mount for its Dremel tools.  If you are as unsure of your
ability to drill true vertical holes as I am, you&#8217;ll find it very
useful.</p></div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_floss_modding">Floss Modding</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The Model M (and even more the Model F) is quite noisy compared to
modern keyboards, and this is not to everybody&#8217;s taste. There&#8217;s a
procedure called a "floss mod" that consists of inserting little
lengths of dental floss or paracord core fibers down the middle of
each buckling spring.  This considerably reduces the action noise,
especially the pingy high-freqency transients.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Be careful to trim the fibers flush with the spring tops rather
than allowing them to protrude, as protruding ends can degrade the
crispness of the key feel.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_retrojacking">Retrojacking</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This is a term I coined for a mod that exploits the way Lexmark did
their fixed-cable cheapout to make an SDL jack magically appear in
your case.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This mod becomes necessary because the fixed cables are flimsy and
their insulation has a nasty tendency to fray, especially where it
attaches to the strain reliever (the gray rectangle of plastic where
the cable meets the case).  This can actually make the keyboard
an electrical hazard.</p></div>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>
Open the case of your M and take off the top half.  Look at the
rear edge and note the number and lead count of ribbon cables going to the
PCB. Usually it&#8217;s going to be either 16-8-4 or 16-12.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The hard part: get your hands on an M controller board with an SDL
jack and sockets matching your ribbon cables, and which is the same
size or smaller than your installed board.  You&#8217;ll need an SDL
cable, too. These parts can sometimes be salvaged from Ms that are too
beat up to be restored.  Or they can sometimes be purchased on eBay.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Disengage your cable. Start by pulling the male Molex plug
terminating it from its socket on the PCB; you may also need to unbolt
a ground wire running from the cable to the backplate.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Free the cable. At one rear corner of the PCB there&#8217;s a small
plastic shim with Mickey Mouse ears, each surrounding a vertical peg;
pull it up and out.  Lo! An SDL-jack aperture magically appears!
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Extract the cable. Push the Molex plug through the jack aperture.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The board is held in place by the pegs you revealed in step 4, and
possibly by two plastic clips to the rear. Lift it off the pegs.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Align the jack on your replacement board with the recently-revealed
jack aperture and drop your replacement board onto the pegs (and into
the clips if present). Connect up the ribbon cables.
</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>That&#8217;s it.  Your M now has a jack and a sturdier cable.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="conversion">Conversion and controller mods</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The easiest way to adapt a pre-USB Model M to do USB is to use
an adapter that plus into the existing cable.  Some people
are unsatisfied with this, preferring a modification inside the
Model M&#8217;s case and exposing a USB jack or cable.  One reason for
this dissatisfaction is <a href="#power">power drain issues</a>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Several people have published USB conversion mods using the Teensy
development board. You can find them by searching the Web for "model m
teensy"; <a href="http://straypoetry.com/ibm-model-m-keyboard/">this one</a> is
representative.  These don&#8217;t replace the keyboard controller; instead
they mount the Teensy connected to it inside the case to do protocol
conversion and provide a USB micro-B jack.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Mods that replace the controller are more difficult, and generally
require a small custom PCB.  While they are generally open-source,
none has yet made it to true volume production.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <a href="https://modelh.club/">Model H</a> by John Hawthorn comes in two
different variants, one to match each of the two earlier (16-8-4 and
16-12) configurations of Model M ribbon cables.  It uses the actively
maintained and well documented QMK firmware.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <a href="http://mg8.org/rump/">Rump Mod</a> by Chris
Lee replaces the Model M&#8217;s controller with a tiny custom PCB
running open-source keyboard firmware.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <a href="https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=103648.0">TMK converter</a> is an
internal mod that covers all F XT and F AT keyboards. Because the F
controller is integrated on to the sensor PCB, this mod mod doesn&#8217;t
replace it. Rather, a micrboard plugs into the connector exposed by
the stock controller and exports its own controller cable.</p></div>
