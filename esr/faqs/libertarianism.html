<p>There are a number of standard questions about libertarianism
that have been periodically resurfacing in the politics groups for
years. This posting attempts to answer some of them. I make no
claim that the answers are complete, nor that they reflect a
(nonexistent) unanimity among libertarians; the issues touched on
here are tremendously complex. This posting will be useful,
however, if it successfully conveys the flavor of libertarian
thought and gives some indication of what most libertarians
believe.</p>

<a name="A"><h1>A. Definitions, Principles and History:</h1></a>

<a name="A1"><h2>A1. What is a libertarian?</h2></a>

<p>The word means approximately "believer in liberty". Libertarians
believe in individual conscience and individual choice, and reject
the use of force or fraud to compel others except in response to
force or fraud. (This latter is called the "Non-Coercion Principle"
and is the one thing all libertarians agree on.)</p>

<a name="A2"><h2>A2. What do libertarians want to do?</h2></a>

<p>Help individuals take more control over their own lives. Take
the state (and other self-appointed representatives of "society")
out of private decisions. Abolish both halves of the
welfare/warfare bureaucracy (privatizing real services) and
liberate the 7/8ths of our wealth that's now soaked up by the costs
of a bloated and ineffective government, to make us all richer and
freer. Oppose tyranny everywhere, whether it's the obvious variety
driven by greed and power-lust or the subtler, well-intentioned
kinds that coerce people "for their own good" but against their
wills.</p>

<a name="A3"><h2>A3. Where does libertarianism come from?</h2></a>

<p>Modern libertarianism has multiple roots. Perhaps the oldest is
the minimal-government republicanism of the U.S.'s founding
revolutionaries, especially Thomas Jefferson and the
Anti-Federalists. Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill and the "classical
liberals" of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were another
key influence. More recently, Ayn Rand's philosophy of "ethical
egoism" and the Austrian School of free-market capitalist economics
have both contributed important ideas. Libertarianism is alone
among 20th-century secular radicalisms in owing virtually nothing
to Marxism.</p>

<a name="A4"><h2>A4. How do libertarians differ from "liberals"?</h2></a>

<p>Once upon a time (in the 1800s), "liberal" and "libertarian"
meant the same thing; "liberals" were individualist, distrustful of
state power, pro-free- market, and opposed to the entrenched
privilege of the feudal and mercantilist system. After 1870, the
"liberals" were gradually seduced (primarily by the Fabian
socialists) into believing that the state could and should be used
to guarantee "social justice". They largely forgot about individual
freedom, especially economic freedom, and nowadays spend most of
their time justifying higher taxes, bigger government, and more
regulation. Libertarians call this socialism without the brand
label and want no part of it.</p>

<a name="A5"><h2>A5. How do libertarians differ from "conservatives"?</h2></a>

<p>For starters, by not being conservative. Most libertarians have
no interest in returning to an idealized past. More generally,
libertarians hold no brief for the right wing's rather overt
militarist, racist, sexist, and authoritarian tendencies and reject
conservative attempts to "legislate morality" with censorship, drug
laws, and obnoxious Bible-thumping. Though libertarians believe in
free-enterprise capitalism, we also refuse to stooge for the
military-industrial complex as conservatives are wont to do.</p>

<a name="A6"><h2>A6. Do libertarians want to abolish the government?</h2></a>

<p>Libertarians want to abolish as much government as they
practically can. About 3/4 are "minarchists" who favor stripping
government of most of its accumulated power to meddle, leaving only
the police and courts for law enforcement and a sharply reduced
military for national defense (nowadays some might also leave
special powers for environmental enforcement). The other 1/4
(including the author of this FAQ) are out-and-out anarchists who
believe that "limited government" is a delusion and the free market
can provide better law, order, and security than any goverment
monopoly.</p>

<p>Also, current libertarian political candidates recognize that
you can't demolish a government as large as ours overnight, and
that great care must be taken in dismantling it carefully. For
example, libertarians believe in open borders, but unrestricted
immigration now would attract in a huge mass of welfare clients, so
most libertarians would start by abolishing welfare programs before
opening the borders. Libertarians don't believe in tax-funded
education, but most favor the current "parental choice" laws and
voucher systems as a step in the right direction.</p>

<p>Progress in freedom and prosperity is made in steps. The Magna
Carta, which for the first time put limits on a monarchy, was a
great step forward in human rights. The parliamentary system was
another great step. The U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights, which
affirmed that even a democratically-elected government couldn't
take away certain inalienable rights of individuals, was probably
the single most important advance so far. But the journey isn't
over.</p>

<a name="A7"><h2>A7. What's the difference between small-l libertarian
and big-l Libertarian?</h2></a>

<p>All Libertarians are libertarians, but not the reverse. A
libertarian is a person who believes in the Non-Coercion Principle
and the libertarian program. A Libertarian is a person who believes
the existing political system is a proper and effective means of
implementing those principles; specifically, "Libertarian" usually
means a member of the Libertarian Party, the U.S.'s largest and
most successful third party. Small-ell libertarians are those who
consider the Libertarian Party tactically ineffective, or who
reject the political system generally and view democracy as "the
tyranny of the majority".</p>

<a name="A8"><h2>A8. How would libertarians fund vital public services?</h2></a>

<p>By privatizing them. Taxation is theft -- if we must have a
government, it should live on user fees, lotteries, and endowments.
A government that's too big to function without resorting to
extortion is a government that's too big, period. Insurance
companies (stripped of the state-conferred immunities that make
them arrogant) could use the free market to spread most of the
risks we now "socialize" through government, and make a profit
doing so.</p>

<a name="A9"><h2>A9. What would a libertarian "government" do and how would it
work?</h2></a>

<p>Enforce contracts. Anarcho-libertarians believe the "government"
in this sense can be a loose network of rent-a-cops, insurance
companies, and for-profit arbitration boards operating under a
shared legal code; minarchists believe more centralization would be
necessary and envision something much like a Jeffersonian
constitional government. All libertarians want to live in a society
based (far more than ours now is) on free trade and mutual
voluntary contract; the government's job would be strictly to
referee, and use the absolute minimum of force necessary to keep
the peace.</p>

<a name="B"><h1>B. Politics and Consequences:</h1></a>

<a name="B1"><h2>B1. What is the libertarian position on abortion?</h2></a>

<p>Most libertarians are strongly in favor of abortion rights (the
Libertarian Party often shows up at pro-rights rallies with banners
that say "We're Pro-Choice on Everything!"). Many libertarians are
personally opposed to abortion, but reject governmental meddling in
a decision that should be private between a woman and her
physician. Most libertarians also oppose government funding of
abortions, on the grounds that "pro-lifers" should not have to
subsidize with their money behavior they consider to be murder.</p>

<a name="B2"><h2>B2. What is the libertarian position on minority, gay &amp;
women's rights?</h2></a>

<p>Libertarians believe that every human being is entitled to
equality before the law and fair treatment as an individual
responsible for his or her own actions. We oppose racism, sexism,
and sexual-preference bigotry, whether perpetrated by private
individuals or (especially) by government. We reject racial
discrimination, whether in its ugly traditional forms or in its
newer guises as Affirmative Action quotas and "diversity"
rules.</p>

<p>We recognize that there will always be bigotry and hatred in the
world, just as there will always be fear and stupidity; but one
cannot use laws to force understanding any more than one can use
laws to force courage or intelligence. The only fair laws are those
that never mention the words "black" or "white"; "man" or "woman";
"gay" or "straight". When people use bigotry as an excuse to commit
force or fraud, it is the act itself which is the crime, and
deserves punishment, not the motive behind it.</p>

<a name="B3"><h2>B3. What is the libertarian position on gun control?</h2></a>

<p>Consistently opposed. The revolutionaries who kicked out King
George based their call for insurrection on the idea that Americans
have not only the right but the <strong>duty</strong> to oppose a
tyrannical government with force -- and that duty implies readiness
to <strong>use</strong> force. This is why Thomas Jefferson said
that "Firearms are the American yeoman's liberty teeth" and, in
common with many of the Founding Fathers, asserted that an armed
citizenry is the securest guarantee of freedom. Libertarians assert
that "gun control" is a propagandist's lie for "people control",
and even if it worked for reducing crime and violence (which it
does not; when it's a crime to own guns, only criminals own them)
it would be a fatally bad bargain.</p>

<a name="B4"><h2>B4. What is the libertarian position on art, pornography and
censorship?</h2></a>

<p>Libertarians are opposed to any government-enforced limits on
free expression whatsoever; we take an absolutist line on the First
Amendment. On the other hand, we reject the "liberal" idea that
refusing to subsidize a controversial artist is censorship. Thus,
we would strike down all anti-pornography laws as unwarranted
interference with private and voluntary acts (leaving in place laws
punishing, for example, coercion of minors for the production of
pornography). We would also end all government funding of art; the
label of "artist" confers no special right to a living at public
expense.</p>

<a name="B5"><h2>B5. What is the libertarian position on the draft?</h2></a>

<p>We believe the draft is slavery, pure and simple, and ought to
be prohibited as "involuntary servitude" by the 13th Amendment. Any
nation that cannot find enough volunteers to defend it among its
citizenry does not deserve to survive.</p>

<a name="B6"><h2>B6. What is the libertarian position on the "drug war"?</h2></a>

<p>That all drugs should be legalized. Drug-related crime (which is
over 85% of all crime) is caused not by drugs but by drug
<strong>laws</strong> that make the stuff expensive and a monopoly
of criminals. This stance isn't "approving" of drugs any more than
defending free speech is "approving" of Nazi propaganda; it's just
realism -- prohibition doesn't work. And the very worst hazard of
the drug war may be the expansion of police powers through
confiscation laws, "no-knock" warrants and other "anti-drug"
measures. These tactics can't stop the drug trade, but they
<strong>are</strong> making a mockery of our supposed
Constitutional freedoms.</p>

<p>Libertarians would leave in place laws against actions which
directly endanger the physical safety of others, like driving under
the influence of drugs, or carrying a firearm under the
influence.</p>

<a name="B7"><h2>B7. What would libertarians do about concentrations of
corporate power?</h2></a>

<p>First of all, stop creating them as our government does with
military contractors and government-subsidized industries. Second,
create a more fluid economic environment in which they'd break up.
This happens naturally in a free market; even in ours, with taxes
and regulatory policies that encourage gigantism, it's quite rare
for a company to stay in the biggest 500 for longer than twenty
years. We'd abolish the limited-liability shield laws to make
corporate officers and stockholders fully responsible for a
corporation's actions. We'd make it impossible for corporations to
grow fat on "sweetheart deals" paid for with taxpayers' money; we'd
lower the cost of capital (by cutting taxes) and regulatory
compliance (by repealing regulations that presume guilt until you
prove your innocence), encouraging entrepreneurship and letting
economic conditions (rather than government favoritism) determine
the optimum size of the business unit.</p>

<a name="C"><h1>C. Standard Criticisms</h1></a>

<h2>C1. But what about the environment? Who speaks for the
trees?</h2></a>

<p>Who <strong>owns</strong> the trees? The disastrous state of the
environment in what was formerly the Soviet Union illustrates the
truism that a resource theoretically "owned" by everyone is valued
by no one. Ecological awareness is a fine thing, but without strong
private-property rights no one can <strong>afford</strong> to care
enough to conserve. Libertarians believe that the only effective
way to save the Earth is to give everyone economic incentives to
save their little bit of it.</p>

<a name="C2"><h2>C2. Don't strong property rights just favor the rich?</h2></a>

<p>No. What favors the rich is the system we have now -- a fiction
of strong property rights covering a reality of property by
government fiat; the government can take away your "rights" by
eminent domain, condemnation, taxation, regulation and a thousand
other means. Because the rich have more money and time to spend on
influencing and subverting government, such a system inevitably
means they gain at others' expense. A strong government
<strong>always</strong> becomes the tool of privilege. Stronger
property rights and a smaller government would weaken the power
elite that inevitably seeks to seduce government and bend it to
their own self-serving purposes --- an elite far more dangerous
than any ordinary criminal class.</p>

<a name="C3"><h2>C3. Would libertarians just abandon the poor?</h2></a>

<p>No, though abandoning the poor might be merciful compared to
what government has done to them. As the level of "anti-poverty"
spending in this country has risen, so has poverty. Government
bureaucracies have no incentive to lift people out of dependency
and every incentive to keep them in it; after all, more poverty
means a bigger budget and more power for the bureaucrats.
Libertarians want to break this cycle by abolishing
<strong>all</strong> income-transfer programs and allowing people
to <strong>keep</strong> what they earn instead of taxing it away
from them. The wealth freed up would go directly to the private
sector, creating jobs for the poor, decreasing the demand on
private charity, and increasing charitable giving. The results
might diminish poverty or they might leave it at today's levels --
but it's hard to see how they could be any <strong>less</strong>
effective than the present wretched system.</p>

<a name="C4"><h2>C4. What about national defense?</h2></a>

<p>This issue makes minarchists out of a lot of would-be
anarchists. One view is that in a libertarian society
<strong>everyone</strong> would be heavily armed, making invasion
or usurpation by a domestic tyrant excessively risky. This is what
the Founding Fathers clearly intended for the U.S. (the
Constitution made no provision for a standing army, entrusting
defense primarily to a militia consisting of the entirety of the
armed citizenry). It works today in Switzerland (also furnishing
one of the strongest anti-gun-control arguments). The key elements
in libertarian-anarchist defense against an invader would be: a
widespread ideology (libertarianism) that encourages resistance;
ready availability of deadly weapons; and no structures of
government that an invader can take over and use to rule
indirectly. Think about the Afghans, the Viet Cong, the Minutemen
-- would <strong>you</strong> want to invade a country full of
dedicated, heavily armed libertarians? :-)</p>

<p>Minarchist libertarians are less radical, observe that U.S.
territory could certainly be protected effectively with a military
costing less than half of the bloated U.S. military budget.</p>

<a name="C5"><h2>C5. Don't you believe in cooperating? Shouldn't people help
each other?</h2></a>

<p>Voluntary cooperation is a wonderful thing, and we encourage it
whenever we can. Despite the tired old tag line about "dog-eat-dog
competition" and the presence of government intervention, the
relatively free market of today's capitalism is the most
spectacular argument for voluntary cooperation in history;
millions, even billions of people coordinating with each other
every day to satisfy each others' needs and create untold
wealth.</p>

<p>What we oppose is the mockeries politicians and other criminals
<strong>call</strong> cooperation but impose by force; there is no
"cooperation" in taxation or the draft or censorship any more than
you and I are "cooperating" when I put a gun to your head and steal
your wallet.</p>

<a name="D"><h1>D. Prospects</h1></a>

<a name="D1"><h2>D1. How can I get involved?</h2></a>

<p>Think about freedom, and act on your thoughts. Spend your
dollars wisely. Oppose the expansion of state power. Promote
"bottom-up" solutions to public problems, solutions that empower
individuals rather than demanding intervention by force of
government. Give to private charity. Join a libertarian
organization; the Libertarian Party, or the Advocates for
Self-Government, or the Reason Foundation. Start your own business;
create wealth and celebrate others who create wealth. Support
<strong>voluntary</strong> cooperation.</p>

<a name="D2"><h2>D2. Is libertarianism likely to get a practical test in my
lifetime?</h2></a>

<p>No one knows. Your author thinks libertarianism is about where
constitutional republicanism was in 1750 -- a solution waiting for
its moment, a toy of political theorists and a few visionaries
waiting for the people and leaders who can actualize it. The
collapse of Communism and the triumph of capitalist economics will
certainly help, by throwing central planning and the "nanny state"
into a disrepute that may be permanent. Some libertarians believe
we are headed for technological and economic changes so shattering
that no statist ideology can possibly survive them (in particular,
most of the nanotechnology "underground" is hard-core libertarian).
Only time will tell.</p>
