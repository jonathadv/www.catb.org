<h1>The Rampantly Unofficial Linus Torvalds FAQ</h1>

<p>...a collection of trivia and personal facts about Linus.</p>

<h1>1. Who is Linus Torvalds?</h1>

<p>He wrote the <a href='http://www.kernel.org'>Linux</a>
kernel. If you don't know that, why are you reading this?</p>

<h1>2. What does he look like?</h1>

<p>Here is a decent <a href="small-linus.jpg">picture of Linus</a>. It
is Copyright 1999 by <a href="http://www.garywagnerphotos.com">Gary
Wagner</a>. He has since had laser eye surgery and no longer wears
glasses.</p>

<h1>3. How should I pronounce `Linus'?</h1>

<p>If you're speaking Swedish (his milk tongue) it's /lee'nus/. You
can hear this in an <a href="swedish.au">audio file</a> if you have
a sound card.</p>

<p>If you're speaking English, Linus answers to either /lie'nus/
(long i) or /li'nus/ (short i). We have a <a
href="english.au">sound file</a> of Linus pronouncing his name in
English.</p>

<h1>4. Where is Linus from?</h1>

<p><a
href="http://www.finland.fi/finfo/english/default.html">Finland</a>.
He grew up in <a href="http://www.hel.fi/english/">Helsinki</a>
(the capital of Finland and its largest city). He wrote the Linux
kernel while a student at <a
href="http://www.helsinki.fi/english/">Helsinki University</a>.</p>

<h1>5. When was he born?</h1>

<p>December 28th 1969.</p>

<h1>6. If Linus is Finnish, why is his birth language Swedish?</h1>

<p>Finland has a significant (about 6%) <a
href="http://virtual.finland.fi/finfo/english/finnswedes.html">Swedish-speaking
minority population</a>. They call themselves <q>finlandssvensk</q> or
<q>finlandssvenskar</q> and consider themselves
Finns; many of their families have lived in Finland for
centuries. Swedish is one of Finland's two official languages.</p>

<h1>7. What is Linus's middle name?</h1>

<p>Many people seem to think think Linus's middle name is "God". A
few claim it ought to be <a
href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/ecsl">Eric</a>. But in fact his
middle name is `Benedict'. He doesn't use it much.</p>

<h1>8. Where does Linus live?</h1>

<p>He's now resident in Portland, Oregon, having moved to the
U.S. from Helsinki in early 1997.  He lived in Santa Clara and
San Jose before going to work for OSDL</p>

<h1>9. Does Linus have a home page?</h1>

<p>He has one at <a
href="http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/~torvalds">http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/~torvalds</a>;
it's got an animated penguin and cute pictures of his baby daughter
Patricia Miranda Torvalds.</p>

<h1>10. What editor and mail reader does Linus use?</h1>

<p>Linus deftly avoids the most persistent religious war in the
hacker community by using neither Emacs nor vi. He uses MicroEmacs.
And, we are told, Pine as a mail reader.</p>

<h1>11. What is Linus's email address?</h1>

<p>You can reach him at <a
href="mailto:torvalds@osdl.org">torvalds@osdl.org</a>.</p>

<p>Note: because Linus is who he is, he gets a staggering amount of
email that he has to deal with. <strong>Don't waste his
time.</strong> Linus is too nice a guy to hurt you if you abuse
this address, but there are probably about a hundred thousand
people who would be displeased enough to mess with you if you
did.</p>

<h1>12. What does Linus do when he's not hacking Linux?</h1>

<p>He works at <a
href="http://www.osdl.org">Open Source Development Labs</a>.</p>

<p>He plays with his baby daughters, Patricia Miranda and Daniela.
We have a <a href="le2.jpg">picture of his family</a>.</p>

<p>He drinks beer (especially Guinness). Occasionally he shoots
pistols. He does not combine these two activities.</p>

<p>He enjoys driving his Merecedes SLK 32 AMG.</p>

<p>Yes, he in fact has a life. We await enlightenment on his other
leisure-time activities. Assuming he wants to talk about them.</p>
