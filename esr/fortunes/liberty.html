drawn around us by the equal rights of others."

Sometimes it is said that man cannot be trusted with the government
of himself.  Can he, then, be trusted with the government of others?
</p><p align=right>	-- Thomas Jefferson, in his 1801 inaugural address
</p><p>
A wise and frugal government, which shall restrain men from injuring
one another, which shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their
own pursuits of industry and improvement, and shall not take from the
mouth of labor the bread it has earned. This is the sum of good
government, and all that is necessary to close the circle of our
felicities.
</p><p align=right>	-- Thomas Jefferson, in his 1801 inaugural address
</p><p>
"They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary 
safety deserve neither liberty nor safety."
</p><p align=right>	-- Benjamin Franklin, Historical Review of Pennsylvania, 1759.
</p><p>
"Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the
government's purposes are beneficient...The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in
insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well meaning but without understanding."
</p><p align=right>	-- Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis
</p><p>
"Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice; moderation in the
pursuit of justice is no virtue."
</p><p align=right>	-- Barry Goldwater (actually written by Karl Hess)
</p><p>
"I hold it, that a little rebellion, now and then, is a good thing, and as 
necessary in the political world as storms in the physical."
</p><p align=right>	-- Thomas Jefferson, Letter to James Madison, January 30, 1787
</p><p>
"This country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit it. 
Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government, they can exercise
their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to 
dismember it or overthrow it."	-- Abraham Lincoln, 4 April 1861
</p><p>
No one is bound to obey an unconstitutional law and no courts are bound
to enforce it.  	-- 16 Am. Jur. Sec. 177 late 2d, Sec 256

</p><p align=right>	-- Max Stirner

"Today, we need a nation of Minutemen, citizens who are not only prepared to
take arms, but citizens who regard the preservation of freedom as the basic
purpose of their daily life and who are willing to consciously work and
sacrifice for that freedom."	-- John F. Kennedy
</p><p>
"Government is not reason, it is not eloquence, it is force; like fire, a
troublesome servant and a fearful master. Never for a moment should it be left
to irresponsible action."
</p><p align=right>	-- George Washington, in a speech of January 7, 1790
</p><p>
The spirit of resistance to government is so valuable on certain occasions, 
that I wish it always to be kept alive.  It will often be exercised when 
wrong, but better so than not to be exercised at all. I like a little 
rebellion now and then.	-- Thomas Jefferson, letter to Abigail Adams, 1787
</p><p>
[W]hat country can preserve its liberties, if its rulers are not
warned from time to time that [the] people preserve the spirit of
resistance?  Let them take arms...The tree of liberty must be
refreshed from time to time, with the blood of patriots and tyrants.
</p><p align=right>	-- Thomas Jefferson, letter to Col. William S. Smith, 1787 
</p><p>
"Guard with jealous attention the public liberty.  Suspect every one
who approaches that jewel.  Unfortunately, nothing will preserve it
but downright force.  Whenever you give up that force, you are
inevitably ruined."	-- Patrick Henry, speech of June 5 1788
</p><p>
A man who has nothing which he is willing to fight for, nothing 
which he cares about more than he does about his personal safety, 
is a miserable creature who has no chance of being free, unless made 
and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself. 
</p><p align=right>	-- John Stuart Mill, writing on the U.S. Civil War in 1862
</p><p>
You need only reflect that one of the best ways to get yourself a
reputation as a dangerous citizen these days is to go about repeating
the very phrases which our founding fathers used in the great struggle
for independence.	-- Attributed to Charles Austin Beard (1874-1948)
</p><p>
"Those who make peaceful revolution impossible 
will make violent revolution inevitable."
</p><p align=right>	-- John F. Kennedy
</p><p>
The American Republic will endure, until politicians realize they can
bribe the people with their own money.
</p><p align=right>	-- Alexis de Tocqueville
</p><p>
Good intentions will always be pleaded for every assumption of
authority. It is hardly too strong to say that the Constitution was
made to guard the people against the dangers of good intentions. There
are men in all ages who mean to govern well, but they mean to
govern. They promise to be good masters, but they mean to be masters.
</p><p align=right>	-- Daniel Webster
</p><p>
What, then is law [government]? It is the collective organization of
the individual right to lawful defense."
</p><p align=right>	-- Frederic Bastiat, "The Law"
</p><p>
Sometimes the law defends plunder and participates in it. Sometimes the law
places the whole apparatus of judges, police, prisons and gendarmes at the
service of the plunderers, and treats the victim -- when he defends himself --
as a criminal.	-- Frederic Bastiat, "The Law"
</p><p>
Live free or die; death is not the worst of evils.
</p><p align=right>	-- General George Stark.
</p><p>
If a thousand men were not to pay their tax-bills this year, that would
... [be] the definition of a peaceable revolution, if any such is possible.
</p><p align=right>	-- Henry David Thoreau
</p><p>
The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any
member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm
to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient
warrant.	-- John Stuart Mill, "On Liberty", 1859
</p><p>
You [should] not examine legislation in the light of the benefits it will
convey if properly administered, but in the light of the wrongs it
would do and the harm it would cause if improperly administered
</p><p align=right>	-- Lyndon Johnson, former President of the U.S.
</p><p>
The difference between death and taxes is death doesn't get worse
every time Congress meets
</p><p align=right>	-- Will Rogers
</p><p>
The end move in politics is always to pick up a gun.
</p><p align=right>	-- R. Buckminster Fuller
</p><p>
Of all tyrannies, a tyranny exercised for the good of its victims may
be the most oppressive. It may be better to live under robber barons
than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may
sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those
who torment us for our own good will torment us without end, for they
do so with the approval of their consciences.
</p><p align=right>	-- C. S. Lewis
</p><p>
It is proper to take alarm at the first experiment on our
liberties. We hold this prudent jealousy to be the first duty of
citizens and one of the noblest characteristics of the late
Revolution. The freemen of America did not wait till usurped power had
strengthened itself by exercise and entangled the question in
precedents. They saw all the consequences in the principle, and they
avoided the consequences by denying the principle. We revere this
lesson too much ... to forget it	-- James Madison.
</p><p>
A ``decay in the social contract'' is detectable; there is a growing
feeling, particularly among middle-income taxpayers, that they are not
getting back, from society and government, their money's worth for
taxes paid. The tendency is for taxpayers to try to take more control
of their finances...	-- IRS Strategic Plan, (May 1984)
</p><p>
It will be of little avail to the people, that the laws are made by
men of their own choice, if the laws be so voluminous that they cannot
be read, or so incoherent that they cannot be understood; if they be
repealed or revised before they are promulgated, or undergo such
incessant changes that no man, who knows what the law is to-day, can
guess what it will be to-morrow. Law is defined to be a rule of
action; but how can that be a rule, which is little known, and less
fixed?	-- James Madison, Federalist Papers 62
</p><p>
I cannot undertake to lay my finger on that article of the
Constitution which grant[s] a right to Congress of expending, on
objects of benevolence, the money of their constituents.
</p><p align=right>	-- James Madison, 1794
</p><p>
..every Man has a Property in his own Person. This no Body has any
Right to but himself.  The Labour of his Body, and the Work of his
Hands, we may say, are properly his. .... The great and chief end
therefore, of Mens uniting into Commonwealths, and putting themselves
under Government, is the Preservation of their Property.
</p><p align=right>	-- John Locke, "A Treatise Concerning Civil Government"
</p><p>
The people cannot delegate to government the power to do anything
which would be unlawful for them to do themselves.
</p><p align=right>	-- John Locke, "A Treatise Concerning Civil Government"
</p><p>
The prestige of government has undoubtedly been lowered considerably
by the Prohibition law. For nothing is more destructive of respect for
the government and the law of the land than passing laws which cannot
be enforced. It is an open secret that the dangerous increase of crime
in this country is closely connected with this.
</p><p align=right>	-- Albert Einstein, "My First Impression of the U.S.A.", 1921
</p><p>
Non-cooperation with evil is as much a duty as cooperation with good.
</p><p align=right>	-- Mohandas Gandhi
</p><p>
The real point of audits is to instill fear, not to extract revenue;
the IRS aims at winning through intimidation and (thereby) getting
maximum voluntary compliance
</p><p align=right>	-- Paul Strassel, former IRS Headquarters Agent Wall St. Journal 1980
</p><p>
Don't ever think you know what's right for the other person.
He might start thinking he knows what's right for you.
</p><p align=right>	-- Paul Williams, `Das Energi'
</p><p>
The IRS has become morally corrupted by the enormous power which we in
Congress have unwisely entrusted to it. Too often it acts like a
Gestapo preying upon defenseless citizens.
</p><p align=right>	-- Senator Edward V. Long
</p><p>
The United States is in no way founded upon the Christian religion
</p><p align=right>	-- George Washington & John Adams, in a diplomatic message to Malta.
</p><p>
This would be the best of all possible worlds, if there were
no religion in it.	-- John Adams, in a letter to Thomas Jefferson.
</p><p>
In every country and in every age, the priest has been hostile to
liberty. He is always in alliance with the despot, abetting his abuses
in return for protection to his own.	-- Thomas Jefferson, 1814
</p><p>
The day will come when the mystical generation of Jesus by the Supreme
Being as his father, in the womb of a virgin, will be classed with the
fable of the generation of Minerva in the brain of Jupiter.
</p><p align=right>	-- Thomas Jefferson, 1823
</p><p>
I do not find in orthodox Christianity one redeeming feature.
</p><p align=right>	-- Thomas Jefferson
</p><p>
Question with boldness even the existence of a God; because, if there
be one, he must more approve the homage of reason, than that of
blindfolded fear.... Do not be frightened from this inquiry from any
fear of its consequences. If it ends in the belief that there is no
God, you will find incitements to virtue in the comfort and
pleasantness you feel in its exercise...
</p><p align=right>	-- Thomas Jefferson, in a 1787 letter to his nephew
</p><p>
The Bible is not my book, and Christianity is not my religion.  I could never
give assent to the long, complicated statements of Christian dogma.
</p><p align=right>	-- Abraham Lincoln
</p><p>
"...The Bill of Rights is a literal and absolute document. The First
Amendment doesn't say you have a right to speak out unless the
government has a 'compelling interest' in censoring the Internet. The
Second Amendment doesn't say you have the right to keep and bear arms
until some madman plants a bomb. The Fourth Amendment doesn't say you
have the right to be secure from search and seizure unless some FBI
agent thinks you fit the profile of a terrorist. The government has no
right to interfere with any of these freedoms under any circumstances."
</p><p align=right>	-- Harry Browne, 1996 USA presidential candidate, Libertarian Party
</p><p>
The direct use of physical force is so poor a solution to the problem of
limited resources that it is commonly employed only by small children and
great nations.		-- David Friedman
</p><p>
It would be thought a hard government that should tax its people one tenth 
part.	-- Benjamin Franklin
</p><p>
The price of liberty is, always has been, and always will be blood.  The person
who is not willing to die for his liberty has already lost it to the first
scoundrel who is willing to risk dying to violate that person's liberty.  Are
you free? 	-- Andrew Ford
</p><p>
See, when the GOVERNMENT spends money, it creates jobs; whereas when the money
is left in the hands of TAXPAYERS, God only knows what they do with it.  Bake
it into pies, probably.  Anything to avoid creating jobs.	-- Dave Barry
</p><p>
The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed (and
hence clamorous to be led to safety) by menacing it with an endless series
of hobgoblins, all of them imaginary.		-- H.L. Mencken
</p><p>
"Are we to understand," asked the judge, "that you hold your own interests
above the interests of the public?"
</p><p>
"I hold that such a question can never arise except in a society of cannibals."
</p><p align=right>	-- Ayn Rand
</p><p>
All governments are more or less combinations against the
people. . .and as rulers have no more virtue than the ruled. . .
the power of government can only be kept within its constituted
bounds by the display of a power equal to itself, the collected
sentiment of the people.
</p><p align=right>	-- Benjamin Franklin Bache, in a Phildelphia Aurora editorial 1794
</p><p>
Never could an increase of comfort or security be a sufficient good to be
bought at the price of liberty.		-- Hillaire Belloc
</p><p>
Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did, and it never will.
Find out just what people will submit to, and you have found out the exact
amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them; and these will
continue until they are resisted with either words or blows, or with both.
The limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they
oppress.	-- Frederick Douglass, August 4, 1857
</p><p>
Freedom, morality, and the human dignity of the individual consists
precisely in this; that he does good not because he is forced to do
so, but because he freely conceives it, wants it, and loves it.
</p><p align=right>	-- Mikhail Bakunin 
</p><p>
Idealism is the noble toga that political gentlemen drape over their
will to power.		-- Aldous Huxley 
</p><p>
Morality is always the product of terror; its chains and
strait-waistcoats are fashioned by those who dare not trust others,
because they dare not trust themselves, to walk in liberty.
</p><p align=right>	-- Aldous Huxley 
</p><p>
Government is actually the worst failure of civilized man. There has
never been a really good one, and even those that are most tolerable
are arbitrary, cruel, grasping and unintelligent.	-- H. L. Mencken 
</p><p>
A right is not what someone gives you; it's what no one can take from you. 
</p><p align=right>	-- Ramsey Clark
</p><p>
The politician attempts to remedy the evil by increasing the very thing
that caused the evil in the first place: legal plunder.
</p><p align=right>	-- Frederick Bastiat
</p><p>
Every election is a sort of advance auction sale of stolen goods. 
</p><p align=right>	-- H.L. Mencken 
</p><p>
Under democracy one party always devotes its chief energies
to trying to prove that the other party is unfit to rule--and
both commonly succeed, and are right... The United States
has never developed an aristocracy really disinterested or an
intelligentsia really intelligent. Its history is simply a record
of vacillations between two gangs of frauds. 
</p><p align=right>	--- H. L. Mencken
</p><p>
The Constitution is not neutral. It was designed to take the
government off the backs of the people.
</p><p align=right>	-- Justice William O. Douglas 
</p><p>
Society in every state is a blessing, but government even in its best
state is but a necessary evil; in its worst state an intolerable one;
for when we suffer, or are exposed to the same miseries *by a
government*, which we might expect in a country *without government*,
our calamities is heightened by reflecting that we furnish the means
by which we suffer."		-- Thomas Paine
</p><p>
He that would make his own liberty secure must guard even his enemy from
oppression: for if he violates this duty, he establishes a precedent that
will reach unto himself.	-- Thomas Paine
</p><p>
When all government ...in little as in great things... shall be drawn to
Washington as the center of all power; it will render powerless the checks
provided of one government on another, and will become as venal and oppressive
as the government from which we separated."	-- Thomas Jefferson, 1821
</p><p>
Freedom begins between the ears.	-- Edward Abbey
</p><p>
Fantastic doctrines (like Christianity or Islam or Marxism) require unanimity
of belief. One dissenter casts doubt on the creed of millions. Thus the fear
and the hate; thus the torture chamber, the iron stake, the gallows, the labor
camp, the psychiatric ward.	-- Edward Abbey
</p><p>
All forms of government are pernicious, including good government.
</p><p align=right>	-- Edward Abbey
</p><p>
As war and government prove, insanity is the most contagious of
diseases.	-- Edward Abbey
</p><p>
Government: If you refuse to pay unjust taxes, your property will be
confiscated. If you attempt to defend your property, you will be arrested.
If you resist arrest, you will be clubbed. If you defend yourself against
clubbing, you will be shot dead. These procedures are known as the Rule of
Law.	-- Edward Abbey
</p><p>
A true libertarian supports free enterprise, opposes big business;
supports local self-government, opposes the nation-state; supports the
National Rifle Association, opposes the Pentagon.	-- Edward Abbey
</p><p>
Government should be weak, amateurish and ridiculous. At present, it
fulfills only a third of the role.	-- Edward Abbey
</p><p>
"Say what you like about my bloody murderous government," I says,
"but don't insult me poor bleedin' country."	-- Edward Abbey
</p><p>
"America is at that awkward stage.  It's too late to work within the system,
but too early to shoot the bastards."	-- Claire Wolfe
</p><p>
"Since there is no such entity as 'the public,' since the public is merely a
number of individuals, the idea that 'the public interest' supersedes private
interests and rights can have but one meaning: that the interests and rights of
some individuals take precedence over the interests and rights of others."
</p><p align=right>	-- Ayn Rand
