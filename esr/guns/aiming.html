<p>In the twenty-year period between 1973 and 1992, the number of
privately owned firearms in the United States increased 73
percent--from 122 million to nearly 222 million. <em>Handgun</em>
ownership increased by 110 percent, from 37 million to 78 million.
In 1994, the latest year for which data are available, there were
231 million firearms in private hands in the U.S., 82 million of
them handguns.</p>

<p>Advocates of gun control see in these statistics not the wide
distribution of the tools for self-defense or recreation, but
rather an enormous potential for private violence. Indeed, if gun
owners were substantially more violent than their fellow citizens,
the streets would run red with blood. Or more precisely,
<em>country lanes</em> would run red with blood, since gun
ownership is considerably more prevalent in rural than in urban
areas. The fact that rates of violent crime are much higher in
urban areas than in rural and suburban areas is just one of many
pieces of evidence suggesting that the simplistic, but popular,
theory that "guns cause crime" is wrong.</p>

<p>Gun owners are not, in fact, more violent than citizens who do
not own guns. Indeed, the evidence suggests that they tend to be a
bit less prone to violence. Gun owners are better-educated, more
middle-class, more affluent, and somewhat older than average
Americans. Gun owners have roughly the same personality
characteristics as non-owners, and indeed it would be strange if
they did not. As psychologists Edward Deiner and Kenneth Kerber put
it:</p>

<blockquote>Since about one-half of the households in the U.S.
contain a gun, it seems somewhat unrealistic to attribute severe
abnormal characteristics to the average gun owner (unless one is
willing to see considerable pathology in most people).</blockquote>

<p>The prevalence of firearms in private hands constitutes a
practical limitation on what gun control laws can be expected to
accomplish. Some of the more phobic anti-gun activists have urged
that all guns should be "outlawed"; but such proposals are no more
sensible than asking that toasters or automobiles or pet dogs be
"outlawed." At most, one could hope for regulation of firearms
ownership and rules for their use, but the feasibility of strict
mandates, let alone the proscription of whole classes of
commonplace household items, is dubious indeed.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, we do not lack for laws. It is commonly estimated
that more than 20,000 federal, state, and local firearms laws are
on the books in this country, and more are being written all the
time. There is little evidence that these laws have restrained
crime. Nor is there much reason to believe that still more laws
would produce additional public benefit. The reasons why are
examined in this study.</p>

<p>Part 1 offers an overview of several pivotal issues in the gun
control debate. First, we briefly address ten popular
misunderstandings about crime, guns, and gun control. Then we
consider three of these misunderstandings in further depth,
concluding:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The problem of "friends killing friends" is much less
troublesome than the media and other gun control advocates would
have us believe. The evidence suggests that this problem is more
accurately described as criminals killing criminal associates.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Mandatory waiting periods (such as those required under the
Brady law) affect legitimate users of firearms more than criminals
and the mentally ill, against whom waiting periods are supposedly
directed.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Drive-by shootings are already against the law; in fact, they
are potential death penalty cases under the Illinois criminal code.
There is no reason to believe that additional gun control laws
aimed at drive-by shootings will provide any increment of
deterrence.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In Part 2, The Record on Gun Control, we ask: What has it
achieved for Americans to date? Many respected researchers-- James
Wright and Peter Rossi, Gary Kleck, Brandon Centerwall, and
others--have found little or no direct connection between gun
control and crime. A case study of Chicago's experience with gun
control closes this section.</p>

<p>Part 3, The Economics of Gun Control, helps explain <em>why</em>
the record on gun control is so poor. Gun control laws intend to
affect both the supply and the demand for guns in the illegal
market by raising the price of obtaining guns in the <em>legal</em>
market. Economics--the science of supply and demand--offers an
ideal framework for understanding the likely outcome of gun control
policies.</p>

<p>We offer a summary and concluding remarks in Part 4.</p>

<h3>Gun Control: An Overview of the Issues</h3>

<h4>Ten Myths vs. Reality</h4>

<p>Gun control is an issue surrounded by (some would say submerged
in) myth and misunderstanding. We present here ten myths that are
most frequently raised . . . and, from our perspective, most
commonly misunderstood.</p>

<p><b>Myth No. 1: Guns cause crime.</b> A review of the academic
literature shows that there is no relationship between the number
of guns and the amount of crime in the United States.
Criminologists Gary Kleck and E. Britt Patterson reported in 1993
their finding that gun ownership had no significant effect on the
rates of murder, assault, robbery, or rape in the U.S. Between 1973
and 1992, the rate of gun ownership in the U.S. increased by 45
percent (from 610 guns per 1,000 people to 887). The homicide rate
during that period <em>fell</em> by nearly 10 percent (from 9.4
homicides per 100,000 people to 8.5).</p>

<p><b>Myth No. 2: Gun control laws reduce crime.</b> Firearms have
been regulated with increasing stringency in the United States for
most of the past thirty years. Nevertheless, the number of firearms
in private hands has increased continuously by many millions per
year; handguns have become an increasing proportion of privately
owned firearms; and rates of crime, violent crime, and homicide
have shown no relationship to the passage or enforcement of gun
laws. In their 1993 research, Kleck and Patterson analyze the
impact of 19 gun control measures on six categories of violence. In
ninety of the resulting 102 relationships, they found no
significant correlation between gun laws and violence.</p>

<p><b>Myth No. 3: Gun control laws stop friends from killing
friends.</b> Most murderers <em>and most victims</em> of homicide
have criminal records. They are likely to have other criminals as
friends and acquaintances. So while it is true that in many cases
of homicide the offender and victim are known to each other, it is
<em>not</em> true that these "friends killing friends" are the
plain ordinary folks often portrayed in anti-gun propaganda. "It is
not a slander on the few truly innocent and highly sensationalized
victims," writes Dr. Edgar A. Suter and his colleagues, "to note
that the overwhelming predominance of homicide victims' are as
predatory and socially aberrant as the perpetrators of homicide."
Indeed, according to City of Chicago data, the largest and
fastest-growing category of relationship between killer and victim
is "non-relative, non-friend acquaintance."</p>

<p><b>Myth No. 4: Gun control laws keep criminals from obtaining
guns.</b> In surveys of prisoners, a majority report that they had
owned a handgun prior to their imprisonment. But only 7 percent of
criminals' handguns are obtained from legitimate retail sources.
Three-fourths of felons surveyed report they would have no trouble
obtaining a gun when they were released, despite legal prohibitions
against firearms ownership by convicted felons.</p>

<p><b>Myth No. 5: Required waiting periods would prevent some of
the most vicious crimes.</b> The Brady waiting period law imposes
waiting periods on handguns--the least-deadly type of
firearm--while imposing no such restriction on much more deadly,
substitutable weapons such as rifles or shotguns. While handguns
are preferred by criminals because of their portability and
concealability, not every criminal who planned to use a handgun
will abandon his criminal plans when confronted by a waiting
period. Indeed, for reasons discussed in more detail below (see
"Why Waiting Periods Fail"), it is entirely possible that waiting
period laws could increase the number of both killings and
nondeadly woundings.</p>

<p><b>Myth No. 6: Guns don't work as self-protection against
criminals.</b> In fact, guns are about as valuable to civilians as
they are to police officers, and for the same reason. According to
criminologists Gary Kleck and Marc Gertz, every year adults use
guns for protective purposes 2.5 million times. As many as 65 lives
are protected by guns for every life lost to a gun. Each year,
potential victims kill between 2,000 and 3,000 criminals; they
wound an additional 9,000 to 17,000.</p>

<p>Moreover, mishaps are rare. Private citizens mistakenly kill
innocent people only thirty times a year, compared with about 330
mistaken killings by police. Criminals succeed in taking a gun away
from an armed victim less than 1 percent of the time. The real
utility of defensive firearms, moreover, must surely be far
greater, and would be measured not by how many people were shot or
even how often a gun was fired, but rather by the deterrent effects
of a civilian being armed.</p>

<p><b>Myth No. 7: Guns aren't needed as self-protection.</b> About
83 percent of the population will be victims of violent crime at
some point in their lives, and in any given year serious crime
touches 25 percent of all households. The odds are not likely to
improve; there is only one police officer on patrol for every 3,300
people. And the courts repeatedly have ruled that government has at
most a limited duty to protect individual citizens from crime.</p>

<p>An illustrative case is <em>Warren v. District of Columbia</em>,
in which three rape victims sued the city under the following
facts: Two of the victims were upstairs when they heard the other
being attacked by men who had broken in downstairs. From an
upstairs telephone, the two roommates made several calls to the
police. Half an hour passed and their roommate's screams ceased;
they assumed the police must have arrived. In fact, however, their
calls had been lost in the shuffle while the roommate was being
beaten into silent acquiescence. When her roommates went downstairs
to see to her, as the court's opinion describes it, "For the next
fourteen hours the women were held captive, raped, robbed, beaten,
forced to commit sexual acts upon each other, and made to submit to
the sexual demands" of their attackers.</p>

<p>Having set out these facts, the District of Columbia's highest
court nevertheless exonerated the District and its police, noting
that it is</p>

<blockquote>a fundamental principle of American law that a
government and its agents are under no general duty to provide
public services, such as police protection, to any individual
citizen.</blockquote>

<p><b>Myth No. 8: Gun control laws are especially needed to prevent
the purchase of Saturday Night Specials and "assault weapons."</b>
Inexpensive handguns are involved in only 1 to 3 percent of violent
crimes; criminals generally prefer larger caliber and more
expensive handguns. Moreover, in the past fifty years no civilian
has ever used a legally owned machine gun in a violent crime. And
despite their repeated use by drug dealers on television and
movies, no Uzi has ever been used to kill a police officer in the
United States. Even some gun control advocates concede that
so-called assault weapons play a minor role in violent crime. In
1991, 1992, and 1993 combined, there were more than 2,500 criminal
homicides in the City of Chicago--<em>only three of which were
perpetrated with a true, military-style, "assault weapon."</em></p>

<p><b>Myth No. 9: Gun control laws are especially needed to prevent
gun accidents in the home.</b> "Gun-control advocates have sought
to create the impression that firearm accidents involving children
are a large and growing problem," writes the Independence
Institute's David Kopel. "Many people mistakenly conclude that
children die frequently in gun accidents and that sharp
restrictions on gun ownership are necessary to address the
problem." In fact, however, the number of gun accidents involving
both children and adults has fallen dramatically.</p>

<p>In 1970, 2,406 Americans died from firearms accidents. By 1991,
that number had fallen to 1,441--even as the number of guns
increased dramatically. Between 1970 and 1991, the annual rate of
fatal gun accidents was cut in half, from 1.2 to 0.6 per 100,000
Americans. The death rate from firearms accidents is lower than
that from accidental drowning (1.6 per 100,000 in 1991), inhalation
and ingestion of foreign objects (1.3), and complications from
medical procedures (1.0).</p>

<p><b>Myth No. 10: Gun ownership is not a constitutional right.</b>
The Second Amendment reflects the founders' belief that an armed
citizenry (called the general militia ) was a necessary precaution
against tyranny by our own government and its army. The idea that
government has a constitutional right to disarm the general
citizenry is totally foreign to the intent of the Constitutional
framers. Samuel Adams, for example, expressed in the Massachusetts
convention his intention that "the said Constitution be never
construed . . . to prevent the people of the United States who are
peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms." David Kopel
summarizes the legal scholarship on this issue:</p>

<blockquote>In the field of legal scholarship, the primary question
has been answered: the Second Amendment was plainly intended to
guarantee a right of individuals to possess arms. The essential
purpose of this guarantee was not to protect sporting uses of guns,
but to facilitate resistance to criminal governments, which were
seen as simply a larger case of resistance to individual
criminals.</blockquote>

<h3>Who Kills Whom?</h3>

<p>Joseph D. McNamara, one-time chief of the San Jose, California,
police department, and a member of the board of directors of
Handgun Control Inc., has written that "a gun can do strange things
to people." He offers this grim picture:</p>

<blockquote>Take a successful businessman who ordinarily has
complete control of his emotions. If you stick a gun in his hand
when he is under stress, the feeling of power can become
overwhelming. This man becomes fearless. He is a different person,
and his otherwise good judgment may suddenly desert him. At any
moment, this killer personality can present a danger to his wife
and loved ones.</blockquote>

<p>Mr. McNamara does not document this extraordinary story, and the
present authors would be grateful to receive any confirmation that
there may be anything other than a very occasional incidence of
unremarkable Jekylls magically transforming into bug-eyed Hydes
because of a gun. The evidence, as it now exists, is very much the
other way. People who commit murders with guns usually have a
police record, as do their victims.</p>

<p>The evidence usually given in support of the McNamara hypothesis
is that homicide offenders often know or are related to their
victims. That is true, but it hardly proves that these offenders
are successful people ordinarily in control of their emotions. Much
more plausibly, it shows that members of the criminal underworld
often know one another, and that people with predatory, impulsive
patterns of behavior attack relatives and associates as well as
strangers. The often-repeated proposition that murder usually
occurs between friends and family members is bogus--as Adam
Walinsky has recently called it, "a twenty-year fraud" perpetrated
by statistical distortions and misrepresentations.</p>

<p>In a recent, fairly typical year (1993), fewer than 3 percent of
Chicago homicides involved victims in a marital relationship with
the offenders, and only 3 percent involved blood relatives. On the
other hand, in 25 percent of cases the victim and offender were
described by police as "acquaintances" but not "friends," and there
were a similar number of cases where no previous relationship at
all between victim and offender could be established.</p>

<p>Those data surely understate the criminal histories of both
offenders and victims. Only about two-thirds of homicides are ever
"cleared" (that is, result in someone being arrested for the
crime). Homicides resulting from domestic quarrels are cleared at a
much higher rate than killings between gang members or strangers.
Furthermore, an unknown proportion of both offenders and victims
who are shown as having no police record do in fact have such a
record; they only appear not to because of statutes that expunge
the records of juvenile offenders.</p>

<p>In other words, it is not true that homicides are commonly
committed by ordinary citizens who just fly off the handle. Very
seldom are successful people who ordinarily have "complete control"
of their emotions implicated in such crimes (or, for that matter,
in any violent crimes). Most homicides are perpetrated by and upon
socially marginal individuals, many of whom, because of prior
run-ins with the law, <em>are already forbidden by law to possess
firearms.</em> Controlling the behavior of this cohort through
additional gun control legislation is nearly hopeless.</p>

<h3>Why Waiting Periods Fail</h3>

<p>When the Brady law was wending its way toward passage last year,
much was said about the potential of waiting periods to restrict
the flow of firearms into the hands of persons who should not
possess them. It was theorized that the burden on legitimate users
would be small, while the inconvenience to criminals and lunatics
should keep at least a few of them from impulsively buying a gun.
Since the law was passed, various estimates of its effectiveness
have been circulated, all premised on the dubious idea that each
sale denied represented a life saved or a crime averted.</p>

<p>The reality is undoubtedly quite different, though admittedly
difficult to measure. For one thing, the burden on legitimate users
is not necessarily <em>de minimis</em> if the need for a firearm
develops suddenly, as happened, for example, during the Los Angeles
riot several years ago. Civil disturbances of that kind are rare,
but when they occur, those caught in the crossfire may very well
need immediate access to a firearm for self-defense or to defend
family members. A delay of days, or even hours, can and has
resulted in otherwise avoidable deaths.</p>

<p>But aside from being burdensome, waiting period laws are apt to
be ineffective. People who want guns for illegal purposes are
unlikely to be deterred by such a low hurdle as a five-day waiting
period, or indeed a waiting period of any other length. As Nobel
laureate economist Gary Becker has noted,</p>

<blockquote>[Waiting periods] do little to keep guns out of the
hands of teenagers and criminals who obtain their weapons
underground, where guns are sold to anyone who can pay for them.
This is the route by which arsenals of weapons have found their way
into inner cities and elsewhere in the U.S. Guns continue to be
smuggled into the illegal market from abroad, from military stock,
and from crooked gun dealers.</blockquote>

<p>Confronted with a waiting period, a prospective firearms abuser
has two options: either abandon his plans in frustration or find a
substitute weapon. Substitutes include obtaining a gun
illegally--buying one from a fence or other illicit dealer or
simply stealing it outright; obtaining it legally by "borrowing" it
from a relative or associate; obtaining an unregulated weapon, such
as a knife or club; or, in the outrageously counterproductive case
of the Brady law, <em>simply buying a rifle or shotgun instead of a
handgun.</em></p>

<p>No theory predicts how such substitution behavior actually
affects rates of violence or the number of resulting crimes. But it
is difficult to see how a waiting period law could make matters
better, and easy to see how it might make things worse.</p>

<p><b>Substituting knives for guns.</b> When confronted by someone
with a gun, most people, victims and criminals alike, usually
surrender, and for this reason they are less likely to be injured
than when confronted by someone who is either unarmed or armed with
a weapon other than a gun. If waiting period laws cause criminals
to substitute lesser weapons for guns, one could expect to see more
incidents in which woundings occurred.</p>

<p><b>Substituting shoulder arms for handguns.</b> Two-thirds of
the firearms in private hands are rifles or shotguns, which
shot-for-shot are two to three times deadlier than handguns.
(Handguns nevertheless are preferred by criminals because of their
portability and concealability.) The prospect of appreciable
numbers of psychopaths buying, "borrowing," or stealing shoulder
weapons in preference to handguns should be deeply troubling to any
policymaker. Yet it is almost certainly to be expected from the
Brady law, which imposes waiting periods on the least-deadly
firearms while imposing no such restriction on much more deadly
substitutes.</p>

<p><b>Summary.</b> It is entirely possible that waiting period laws
could result in increased numbers of <em>killings and non-lethal
woundings.</em> The former should increase because a larger
proportion of criminals might be armed with rifles or shotguns, and
the latter should increase because more criminals might be armed
with knives or weapons other than a gun.</p>

<h3>Gun Control and Drive-By Shootings</h3>

<p>Because of their seemingly random nature and increasing
frequency, drive-by shootings are among the most disturbing of
crimes. In many cases these begin as affairs of honor, part of the
tit-for-tat of the criminal life. They also may have an economic
motive, as when rival gangs try to perfect a monopoly over drug
sales or other illegal activity in a particular geographic area.
Innocent bystanders are often injured or killed, and gun control
advocacy groups seldom miss an opportunity to take maximum
propaganda advantage of incidents of this kind.</p>

<p>It can hardly be disputed that "something should be done." But
attempts to reduce drive-by shootings by restricting access to
firearms are doomed to failure. It must be borne in mind that in
<em>all cases of drive-by shooting, the weapons themselves and the
use to which they are being put are already illegal and carry heavy
penalties.</em></p>

<p>Under Illinois law it is a felony to carry a loaded handgun in a
vehicle. If the offenders are under 18, mere possession of a
handgun is a Class A misdemeanor, punishable by a sentence of up to
one year in prison. If the offenders are under 21 and convicted
misdemeanants, or adjudged delinquent, their possession of any
firearm or ammunition is a violation, punishable by a sentence of
up to one year. If the offenders are convicted felons, possession
of any firearm is a Class 3 felony, punishable by a sentence of two
to five years.</p>

<p>If the drive-by shooters are carrying an automatic weapon, they
are in violation of federal law and face a penalty of up to ten
years imprisonment. Possession is also illegal under Illinois law.
(It is more likely, however, that the offenders were carrying
semi-automatic weapons, often mistakenly referred to as "assault
weapons" although mechanically no different from many popular
hunting and target rifles.)</p>

<p>The prospect of all these penalties appears not to deter
drive-by shooters, and why should it? They are, after all, on their
way to commit first-degree murder, punishable by no less than a
death penalty. Further gun control laws could hardly be expected to
offer more deterrence than that.</p>

<h2>The Record on Gun Control</h2>

<p>What is the evidence that gun control laws affect rates of
violent crime? Scholars seem to be deeply and often bitterly
divided on this question. Whether one thinks there is abundant
evidence of efficacy or none at all depends on how one evaluates
the many studies that purport to show this effect.</p>

<p>The basic questions here are empirical, but--as is commonly the
case with social science research, where data can be gathered but
experiments cannot be conducted--the facts are difficult to
ascertain and have become deeply embroiled in controversy. In any
event, facts must first of all be organized by a theory.</p>

<p>The theory favoring gun control begins with two plausible and
related observations: First, that firearms facilitate the
infliction of death or great bodily harm because they inflict more
dangerous wounds than weapons that might be substituted for them;
and second, that many killings or grave woundings are not the
product of a literal intention to inflict death or great bodily
harm, but are merely the byproduct of the fact that a gun was handy
and was used. Colin Loftin and his colleagues have called this
latter proposition the "Zimring-Cook" effect, referring to the work
of researchers Frank Zimring and Philip Cook.</p>

<p>The opposite theory, attributable primarily to Florida
criminologist Gary Kleck, stresses that there are two sides to the
strategic ledger. Guns do inflict dangerous wounds, but they are
also useful for self-defense. Moreover, while firearms are,
wound-for-wound, more dangerous than other kinds of weapons,
hostile confrontations with firearms are much less likely to result
in woundings in the first place than face-offs without arms or with
lesser weapons. Because firearms have the potential to reduce the
variance between antagonists' capacity to do one another harm, they
might well contribute to a world in which there is less predatory
behavior rather than more.</p>

<p>Many people believe that the complete disappearance of firearms
would make for a more peaceable world. Still, there is no reason to
believe that there would be a simple, monotonic relationship
between diminishing firearms and diminishing violence. For example,
if every year we could eliminate 10 percent of the nation's
existing stock of firearms, and in Year One, the 10 percent that we
eliminated were those carried by police officers, few people would
expect to see a 10 percent reduction, or indeed any reduction at
all, in violence. Of course no one proposes disarming the police
first. But the point of the illustration is more general: Potential
victims and their protectors, as well as aggressors, are disarmed
by gun control laws. It is not the sheer number of firearms, but
how and to whom they are distributed, that determines whether there
is more violence and crime or less.</p>

<h3>Empirical Evidence: An Overview</h3>

<p>Much of the "evidence" on which both pro- and anti- gun control
partisans rely is simplistic. It is noted, for example, that
England has fewer guns and much less crime than the U.S. . . . but
Switzerland has guns in almost every home, and much less crime than
the U.S. Moreover, there are more guns per person in the American
South than in the North, and more homicides . . . but there are
more guns per person in rural areas than in urban areas, and fewer
homicides.</p>

<p>The thoughtful person immediately recognizes that England,
Switzerland, and the United States, as well as urban and rural
areas within the United States, differ in many ways other than in
just the prevalence of guns. There are differences in culture,
history, and ethnic mix, to name only a few. More variables must be
taken into account.</p>

<p>One method social scientists use to account for the effects of
many variables is "multiple regression analysis." It is a
statistical method that attempts to disentangle the effects of each
of many variables that are thought to affect the phenomenon to be
explained. If a variable seems to be explanatorily useful, it is
termed "statistically significant."</p>

<p>In the most comprehensive and careful such analysis to date,
criminologists Gary Kleck and E. Britt Patterson reported in 1993
their findings on the relationship between guns, violence, and gun
control. Kleck and Patterson sought to avoid the many
methodological weaknesses that had in the past plagued studies of
the effect of gun control laws on violent crime rates. Their
analysis "covered all forms of violence which involves guns,
encompassed every large (over 100,000 population) city in the
nation, and assessed all major forms of existing gun control in the
U.S."</p>

<p>The preponderance of statistical evidence contradicts the notion
that more gun control laws will reduce crime. If they could, we
would have a simple solution to the crime problem. But they do not,
and thus we do not. Believing that gun control will reduce crime is
wishful thinking.</p>

<h3>Wishful Thinking, and Five Studies That Have Supported It</h3>

<p>There is no shortage of wishful thinking among gun control
advocates and the nation's popular media. Nearly twenty years ago,
the National Institute of Justice commissioned a three-year study
to take stock of what was then known about firearms, crime, and
violence in the United States. The authors of that study neatly
summarized the popular case against privately owned firearms. The
indictment, they wrote,</p>

<blockquote>includes the following particulars: (1) Guns are
involved in an astonishing number of crimes in this country. (2) In
other countries with stricter firearms laws and fewer guns in
private hands, gun crime is rare. (3) Most of the firearms involved
in crime are cheap Saturday Night Specials, for which no legitimate
use or need exists. (4) Many families acquire a gun because they
feel the need to protect themselves; eventually they end up
shooting one another. (5) If there were fewer guns around, there
would obviously be less crime. (6) Most of the public also believes
this and has favored stricter gun control laws for as long as
anyone has asked the question. (7) Only the gun lobby prevents us
from embarking on the road to a safer and more civilized
society.</blockquote>

<p>"Both the senior authors of this study"--Professors James Wright
and Peter Rossi--"once shared" this point of view, they wrote; but
"the more deeply we have explored the empirical implications of
this indictment, the less plausible it has become." As of the early
1980s, the evidence in support of the indictment, they found, was
unimpressive and shot through with contradictions. In the decade
since, the indictment has changed not at all, but a fresh crop of
research has been directed at proving the case.</p>

<p>Many works purport to link the wide distribution of private
firearms to high rates of homicide and suicide, and the presence of
gun control measures to reductions in the rates of such violence.
Our discussion here will concentrate on five widely cited papers,
published in <em>The New England Journal of Medicine</em>, which
have become the standard authorities for the proposition that guns
hurt and gun control helps.</p>

<p>First are two articles by John Sloan and others, which purport
to explain the different homicide and suicide experiences of
Seattle, Washington and Vancouver, British Columbia, by the
differences in handgun regulations between the two cities. Second,
in 1986, Arthur Kellermann and Donald Reay concluded that a firearm
kept in the home was 43 times more likely to kill a family member
than a criminal. In October 1993, Kellermann and several
collaborators, using new data, concluded that a person increases
his or her chances of becoming a homicide victim by keeping a gun
at home. Finally, a paper by Colin Loftin and collaborators shows
the decrease of both homicide and suicide following enactment of
the District of Columbia's restrictive 1976 gun control law, which
forbade the purchase, sale, transfer, or possession of handguns by
civilians.</p>

<p>The news media have accepted these studies as firmly
establishing the scientific truth that widespread possession of
firearms leads to high rates of murder and suicide, and that
restrictive gun control laws will lead to lower rates of murder and
suicide. Closer inspection, however, reveals that these studies are
plagued by methodological and interpretive weaknesses, and do not
support the propositions for which they are so often cited.</p>

<h3>Seattle-Vancouver</h3>

<p>The implied premise of the Seattle-Vancouver studies is that the
two cities are matched like identical twins, differing from one
another along only two dimensions: their homicide-suicide rates and
how they regulate handguns. If this were the case, one might infer
some sort of connection between the two variables. But there are
numerous objections to proceeding in this way.</p>

<p>In the first place, it is not possible using the methodology of
these studies to tell what causes what. Does possession of a
firearm pose a risk factor for suicide, or is it rather that people
bent on self-destruction prefer to obtain a firearm a cheap and
relatively certain means of carrying out their intentions?</p>

<p>Secondly, it is erroneous to infer that Seattle and Vancouver
are a "matched set." Substantial demographic differences between
the two cities exist. Sloan and his colleagues did not include a
Mantel-Haenszel analysis (that is, a standard test of statistical
significance) in order to ascertain whether those differences could
account for differences in their observed homicide and suicide
rates. Nor have the study's authors made their data available to
permit others to perform such an analysis.</p>

<p>Moreover, Sloan and his colleagues did not attempt to ascertain
whether the prevalence of handgun ownership actually differed, and
if so how extensively, among the two populations. Handguns have
been restrictively regulated in Canada only since 1977, less than
ten years before the data for the studies were gathered. Yet
handguns have useful lives of a hundred years or more. It is not
known whether (or by how much) Vancouver and Seattle actually
differ with respect to the ownership of handguns. In fact, one
student of the problem has suggested that the prevalence of such
weapons may actually have increased in Canada. In any case, one
certainly cannot reason that, simply because the laws are different
on either side of the border, therefore the actual behavior of the
people is different.</p>

<p>Finally, even if the two cities were literally identical twins,
with only handgun regulation as a variable, it would make little
sense to allow any conclusion to turn on the results of a single
pair-wise comparison. To illustrate: Suppose a researcher followed
a pair of identical twins through their lives and determined that
the only difference between them was in politics (one was a
Socialist, the other not). Suppose further that one of them died at
age 82, while his brother lived to age 85. No one would propose
politics as a risk factor for mortality on the basis of any such
observation--certainly not if it were possible to evaluate the
variable on the basis of other readily available data.</p>

<p>For comparisons between the United States and Canada, such data
<em>are</em> readily available. Thus, Brandon Centerwall was able
to compare the homicide rates of urban and rural populations in
Canadian provinces and in each adjacent American state. He found
<em>no consistent differences</em> between them: "When Canadian
provinces and adjoining U.S. states are compared, three- to tenfold
differences in the prevalence of handguns have not resulted in
consistently different rates of criminal homicide."</p>

<p>Studies of this kind do not lend themselves to eye-catching
headlines and oversimplified certitudes about the causes of
violence and means to prevent it. Yet methodologically, this sort
of study is superior to the Sloan <em>et al.</em> sort, because it
includes all available data, thus avoiding the question of why a
particular pair of cities was selected for comparison. Robert
Mundt's study of Canadian homicide and suicide rates before and
after the enactment of the 1977 law is basically confirmatory:
"When compared with the United States, trends in Canada over the
past ten years in various types of violent crime, suicide, and
accidental death show no dramatic results and few suggestions of
perceptible effects of the 1977 Canadian gun control
legislation."</p>

<h3>Firearms in the Home as a Risk Factor for Homicide</h3>

<p>In October 1993, the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>
published an article by Arthur Kellermann <em>et al.</em> which was
widely received as the definitive statement of the proposition that
firearms kept in the home not only fail to increase the security of
the household, but actually are a risk factor for becoming a victim
of homicide. This 1993 paper followed an earlier (1986) effort by
Kellermann and Donald Reay, also published in the <em>New England
Journal of Medicine</em>, which is the source of the most famous
statistic in the gun control debate: that a firearm kept in the
home is 43 times more likely to be used to kill a member of the
household than to kill a criminal intruder.</p>

<p><b>Evaluation of the 1986 study.</b> There are at least two
important difficulties with the 1986 study and the "43 times"
statistic to which it gave rise. The first, often-overlooked
problem is that more than 85 percent of the Kellermann-Reay gunshot
victims were suicides and not victims of domestic quarrels. The
instrumentality-dependency of suicide is a hotly debated topic, but
at present the evidence is very thin for the hypothesis that any
appreciable portion of observed suicides is a function of the
availability of firearms.</p>

<p>It is always possible, but remains entirely conjectural, that a
handy firearm does raise the rate of suicide. If so, this would be
an example of the "Zimring-Cook" effect--the proposition that a
certain percentage of fatal incidents begin ambiguously so far as
the intentions of the actor are concerned, and result in death only
because an almost-always deadly weapon like a gun is ready at
hand.</p>

<p>It may well be true that a Zimring-Cook effect occurs in some
contexts, but it is difficult to see why suicide would be one of
them. Internationally, rates of suicide appear to be quite
independent both of gun control laws and patterns of firearms
ownership in civilian populations. Very high rates of suicide are
found, for example, in firearms-free populations like Japan--but of
course the rates of suicide in such places might be even higher if
firearms were more readily available. And low rates of suicide are
found in such relatively well-armed jurisdictions as Israel and New
Zealand--but of course those rates might be still lower were
firearms absent. Such prospects are impossible to rule out with
existing research techniques.</p>

<p>If, as a concession to plausibility, one eliminates the suicide
data from the 1986 Kellermann-Reay study, the "43 times" statistic
is transfigured into one less imposing: a firearm kept in the home
is six times more likely to be used to kill a member of the
household than to kill a criminal intruder. But even this number is
of precarious significance, for it embodies the dubious assumption
that comparing "body counts" is a meaningful way to report the
usefulness of firearms.</p>

<p>Comparative body counts are not ordinarily used to measure the
utility of firearms or the use of force. One does not measure the
effectiveness of a police department, for example, by comparing the
number of officers and criminals killed over some time period.
Rather, one asks what effect the police have had on the rate of
crime. Similarly, one should not compare the number of burglars or
other intruders and civilians killed by domestic firearms, but
rather ask how many burglars or other intruders were driven away or
deterred by the firearm.</p>

<p>Any meaningful tally of firearms "use" must include not merely
the fraction of cases in which someone was killed, but also cases
in which there was a wounding and, for that matter, the probably
much larger number of cases in which a weapon was used simply to
threaten, but was not discharged at all. Indeed, the case is
broader even than that. We should also try to estimate the number
of crimes that did not occur at all because of the prospect of
meeting armed resistance. Research by criminologist Don Kates
offers reason to believe that the probability of encountering an
armed defender does enter into a potential criminal's
calculations.</p>

<p><b>Evaluation of the 1993 study.</b> The 1993 study by
Kellermann <em>et al.</em> raises a number of different problems.
The "case-control" methodology used in the study risks generating
spurious correlations if the researcher fails to take into account
subgrouping, sometimes called <em>social stratification.</em></p>

<p>By way of example, the U.S. population can be said to consist of
two subgroups. The first subgroup--a relatively small minority of
the total population--is composed of career criminals, gang
members, and others with a history of criminal activity. This
subgroup has a high risk of homicide and a relatively high gun
ownership rate. The second subgroup--the vast majority of the total
population--is the general law-abiding public. This subgroup has a
low risk of homicide and a lower gun ownership rate than the
first.</p>

<p>Henry Schaffer, professor of genetics at North Carolina State
University, explains:</p>

<blockquote>There is no causal relationship between gun ownership
and homicide in either subgroup. . . . However, when we put the two
groups together into the single population they compose, . . . an
association between gun ownership and homicide [appears]. This is
not due to gun ownership having a causal effect, but rather there
is a "confounding" variable of subgroup membership, and gun
ownership is associated with that subgroup.</blockquote>

<p>In principle, it would be possible to ascertain whether the
Kellermann results can be explained by subgroup analysis, but as
with the Seattle-Vancouver study, the authors have not made their
data available to allow this analysis to be performed. Lawrence
Southwick, professor of management at State University of New York
(Buffalo), has pointed out that because of the authors'
unwillingness to publish their data, it is "not possible to
replicate the statistical tests nor to improve on them." Thus the
results of the study must be accepted "on faith, an attitude not in
keeping with good science."</p>

<p>A second problem with the 1993 study is that its sample is not
well-chosen. As Southwick points out,</p>

<blockquote>Any successful use of a gun for self-defense is
excluded from the sample. If a potential victim used a gun to
threaten or to shoot an intruder, that was not included in the
sample. Only a person who was killed in his own home was included.
Consequently, the authors' statement that our methodology was
capable of demonstrating significant protective effects of gun
ownership as readily as any evidence of increased risk' is clearly
false; any protective effect was deliberately
excluded.</blockquote>

<p>More fundamentally, it appears that, contrary to the authors'
claims, not all the homicides meeting the study's "in the home"
criterion were in fact included in the study. As Henry Schaffer
points out:</p>

<blockquote>There were 444 homicides meeting the "home" criterion.
[Twenty-four] were excluded for "various reasons," leaving 94.6
percent. But then 7 percent were dropped because of a failure to
interview the proxy, and an additional 1 percent because of a
failure to find a control, leaving 388 matched pairs. The authors
state, "Although case-control studies offer many advantages over
ecologic studies, they are prone to several sources of bias. To
minimize selection bias, we included all cases of homicide in the
home, and rigorously followed an explicit procedure for randomly
selecting neighborhood control subjects." [M]any would be willing
to allow 87.4 percent to be described as "all." However, this is
not the end--even though there were 388 matched pairs, it appears
that the study did not obtain complete data on all of them, and the
multivariate analyses used require complete data, and so there were
only 316 matched pairs used in the final analyses. This represents
71.2 percent of the homicides. It is very difficult to accept that
"all" fairly describes this 71.2 percent.</blockquote>

<p>A third problem with the study is the possibility that the
<em>fear of being killed</em> might inspire a person to arm
himself. Actually, that possibility did occur to the study's
authors, since they included a specific disclaimer about it in the
article's text. But Dr. Kellermann, the study's principal author,
seems never to mention the disclaimer in any of his many media
interviews, and as a consequence the point gets quite lost in the
public conversation. That is unfortunate, for rational
self-armament by criminals is a cogent explanation of the
association between firearms ownership and homicide. Peter Reuter
and Mark Kleiman estimated that drug dealers are at great risk of
being murdered, far higher than the risk to which ordinary people
are exposed. Homicide data from Chicago are basically confirmatory:
In recent years 60 percent or more of murder victims have had
police records.</p>

<p>Dr. Kellermann has since refused to meet this point, but rather
offered an obfuscation. "It is relatively easy," he wrote, "to
establish cause and effect when the victim is dead on the floor
with a bullet in his head." But of course there was never a
question whether a bullet in the head might "cause" someone's
death. The question of causation has always been whether being a
drug dealer or criminal, as distinct from being simply a gun owner,
increased the risk of being victimized by customers, suppliers, or
other (criminal) business associates, whether inside the home or
out of it. So long as a well-founded fear of death might lead
someone <em>both</em> to arm himself <em>and</em> to be at greater
risk of being murdered, the correlation upon which Dr. Kellermann
places so much weight simply cannot support the inference he seeks
to draw.</p>

<h3>The District of Columbia Gun Control Experience</h3>

<p>Data from the District of Columbia are persuasive or
unpersuasive about the efficacy of gun control laws, depending upon
what time period is chosen for measurement. Colin Loftin and his
coauthors tracked the experience in the District of Columbia for
seven years after its 1976 gun control law was enacted and
concluded:</p>

<blockquote>In the District of Columbia, the mean frequency of both
suicides and homicides by firearms declined by about one-quarter in
the period after the law went into effect. In contrast, none of the
comparison time series showed declines of similar magnitude during
the same period. . . . The adjacent areas in Maryland and Virginia,
which were not subject to the change in gun regulations, did not
have declines in gun-related homicides and suicides similar to
those observed in the District of Columbia. The best explanation
for the District of Columbia data is the weapons-choice theory
developed by Zimring, Cook, and others. According to this view,
assaults, whether against others or self-directed, vary with
respect to the intent to kill. Some are characterized by a
sustained, single-minded determination, whereas in others the
intention is episodic and ambivalently motivated. If the resolve is
weak or short-lived, the relative frequency with which a particular
type of weapon is used will be influenced by its availability. The
key element in the theory is that firearms are more likely to cause
death than are other weapons that are likely to be substituted. It
follows that even if there is no change in the number of assaults
or suicide attempts, a reduction in the availability of guns will
result in a reduction in the number of deaths.</blockquote>

<p>Loftin <em>et al.</em> professed surprise at the magnitude and
suddenness of the drop-off in gun-related bloodletting following
the enactment of the District's gun control law. Yet, as is
generally well known, only a few years later the District of
Columbia is experiencing a much <em>higher</em> murder rate than
that recorded before the passage of restrictive gun control
legislation. It is a chronic liability of time-series analyses that
the results they generate are highly sensitive to the time periods
chosen for measurement. Indeed, choosing a longer measurement
period would have shown an association between restrictive gun
control laws and <em>increases</em> in the homicide rate.</p>

<p>Loftin and his colleagues state that the introduction of new
variables, such as turf wars among drug dealers, could explain
subsequent increases in homicide rates without necessarily
invalidating the possibility that, in the absence of the
restrictive law, things might have been worse. Indeed so--but this
argumentative escape hatch simply highlights the abiding
uncertainty of this sort of social science research. A policy can
be manifestly a failure, yet its proponents can proclaim it a great
success because of how much worse things would have
been--conjecturally--had no such policy been in effect. By such
"guesstimative" expedients, evidence that is merely suggestive and
preliminary is translated into irrefutable proof.</p>

<p>Yet it remains surprising that the effect that Loftin and his
coauthors believed they had observed had occurred so swiftly. The
theory behind gun control laws--that they "thin out" the number of
weapons in circulation--can hardly be supposed to operate over any
short run, let alone instantaneously. Guns do not self-destruct
because a law was passed, and only the most conscientious and
law-abiding would have disposed of newly outlawed weapons. In fact,
as was true of the Seattle-Vancouver studies discussed earlier,
Loftin did not say whether and how much the law actually reduced
firearms ownership. Such data are unavailable. Yet without them, it
is hardly possible to understand and interpret the supposed
relationship between the distribution of firearms and their rates
of abuse.</p>

<h3>Gun Control in Chicago: A Case Study</h3>

<p>The City of Chicago has one of the nation's most restrictive gun
control laws. Since April 1982 it has been illegal to purchase or
register any handgun within the city. At the time Chicago's law was
passed, then-Mayor Jane Byrne touted it as an anti-crime measure.
How has her claim fared through the past dozen years?</p>

<p>A review of the <em>Chicago Murder Analyses</em> from 1965 to
1992 provides information on this question. The <em>Murder
Analyses</em> are compiled annually by the Chicago Police
Department, offering painstaking detail about the number of murders
committed in the City of Chicago, the types of weapons used in
those murders, the age of offenders and victims, and much more.</p>

<p>Figure 1 shows the number of murders in the City of Chicago
between 1965 (seventeen years before the city's gun control law was
enacted) and 1992 (ten years after gun control). Between 1965 and
1974 there was a steady increase in the number of murders, with
1972 being the only exception. Between 1974 and 1990, the number of
murders stayed within a reasonably narrow range, with a fairly
dramatic fall in--1982 the year gun control was passed. Just five
years later, in 1987, the number of murders in the city began to
climb steadily. Indeed, by gun control's tenth anniversary, the
number of murders in the city was back where it had been a decade
<em>before</em> gun control.</p>

<p>Figures 2 and 3 narrow the analysis to include only firearms
(Figure 2) and handguns (Figure 3). The two figures closely track
Figure 1: steady increase until 1974; stabilization until 1981;
stabilization again at a lower level for five years; and then a
steady increase beginning in 1989.</p>

<p>What all three graphs show is that the number of murders ebbs
and flows with little apparent respect for gun control laws. The
national gun control act of 1968 appears to have had little effect
on murders with firearms in Chicago: The number of murders
committed with handguns rose dramatically in the years following
its passage. The number of murders with handguns was falling in
Chicago <em>before</em> passage of the city's 1982 gun control law.
That year, the number of murders fell precipitously. Was this
evidence of the gun control law working? If so, upon what theory?
Were there suddenly fewer guns in circulation? Were criminals,
heedless of the state's murder laws before the city passed its
ordinance, more careful once handgun possession became a
misdemeanor? Then what?</p>

<p>Then perhaps nothing. After all, the national murder rates rose
very rapidly from the mid-1960s through 1979, and then began
falling. Through most of the 1980s national murder rates declined,
as did the rates in Chicago. Then in the late 1980s, national
murder statistics began to trend up. Chicago's numbers did
likewise. Currently, after thirteen years under a strict handgun
ban, handgun murders and murders of all sorts are at record levels
in the city.</p>

<p>In light of this record, calling for more, or
yet-more-stringent, gun control laws begins to seem like neurotic
behavior.</p>

<h2>The Economics of Gun Control</h2>

<p>Some gun control advocates believe that a reduction in the total
number of firearms will reduce crime. Their implicit model is:</p>

<div class="c2">A reduction in the general availability of firearms
will lead to:</div>

<div class="c2">A reduction in the number of firearms in the hands
of those who might abuse them, which in turn will lead to:</div>

<div class="c2">A reduction in violent crime.</div>

<p>A reduction in the general availability of firearms could be
accomplished in a number of ways, including raising taxes on
firearms and/or ammunition, restrictive licensing of firearms
owners, waiting periods, stricter reporting requirements for
firearms dealers, higher dealer fees, etc. All of these methods
operate by making it more difficult and/or more expensive for the
general public to acquire firearms. All of these methods directly
affect only the <em>legal</em> market for firearms. If enforced,
they will <em>indirectly</em> affect the illegal or black market by
driving up the price of firearms. Firearms still would be available
to criminals. But the price would be higher; one would therefore
expect to see potential criminals purchase fewer guns and reserve
their firearms for "higher-valued" uses. The key questions are: how
many fewer guns would criminals buy; how would they channel their
weapons to higher-valued uses; and how would the firearms
purchasing and retaining behavior of <em>non-criminals</em> change
in response to this price increase?</p>

<p>There are sound theoretical reasons to expect only a small
decrease in the flow of guns to criminals. The reasons have to do
with the characteristics of the supply and demand for firearms in
the illegal market.</p>

<h3>Demand Effects</h3>

<p>How many fewer firearms will be demanded by criminals will
depend upon the responsiveness of criminal buyers to a price
increase, or what economists call the <em>elasticity of
demand.</em> If demand is responsive (<em>elastic</em>), a price
increase will result in a relatively large decrease in the quantity
demanded. If demand is unresponsive (<em>inelastic</em>), a price
increase will result in a relatively small decrease in the quantity
demanded.</p>

<p>Elasticity depends upon the availability, cost, and other
characteristics of substitutes for the item in the intended use. If
there are many good substitutes, demand will tend to be elastic
(responsive); if there are few good substitutes, demand will tend
to be inelastic (unresponsive).</p>

<p>For use in violent crime--armed robbery, turf wars, and so on
there are few good substitutes for firearms. Economists Steven
Balkin and John F. McDonald explain:</p>

<blockquote>. . . because handguns are easily concealed and are
very effective weapons for obtaining victim compliance, other
weapons such as long guns and knives are imperfect substitutes for
handguns. . . . While the elasticity of demand for handguns may
vary with the type of illegal intent, the aforementioned
conjectures lead to the expectation that the overall elasticity of
demand for handguns for criminal purpose is relatively
low.</blockquote>

<p>In other words, the quantity of firearms sought by criminals
will not decrease much in response to a price increase.</p>

<p>Analysis of the demand for firearms reveals a second problem
with gun control proposals. Even if one assumes, conservatively and
counterintuitively, that criminals and non-criminals begin with an
identical desire to obtain a gun, they will not end with an
identical demand, because (by definition) criminals plan definitely
to use their guns (or in any event to have control over whether and
when they will use them), whereas people who want guns for
self-defensive purposes plan to use them only contingently--that
is, in the unlikely event that an appropriate occasion for using
them should present itself. According to Balkin and McDonald,
"recreational demand has the relatively highest price elasticity,
followed by self-protection demand, and offender demand has the
relatively lowest elasticity."</p>

<p>Thus, it appears that gun control laws will have the effect not
of <em>disarming</em> criminals, but rather <em>increasing the
ratio of firearms-holding criminals to non-criminals</em>.
Unilateral disarmament does not have a good reputation in
international affairs, because such a tactic on occasion has
invited aggression by the better-armed party. What reason do we
have to suppose that domestic unilateral disarmament would be more
successful? The result of gun control is likely to be <em>more</em>
violence against non-criminals, not less.</p>

<p>This is hardly a radical insight. Over 200 years ago, in 1764,
Italian criminologist Cesare Beccaria wrote:</p>

<blockquote>The laws that forbid the carrying of arms . . . disarm
those only who are neither inclined nor determined to commit
crimes. . . . Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and
better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to
prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater
confidence than an armed man.</blockquote>

<h3>Supply Effects</h3>

<p>The price increase caused by gun control will affect not only
the demand side of the market for illegal firearms, but also the
supply. As is true of markets for other goods, an increase in the
selling price of illegal firearms will cause an increase in the
number of firearms supplied to the illegal market. How large an
increase depends upon the <em>elasticity of supply</em>.</p>

<p>Unlike demand, the supply of firearms to the illegal market is
likely to be quite elastic. Gun control would eliminate or heavily
regulate the legal market for guns. But reducing the supply of
something in the legal market is likely to <em>increase</em> its
supply in the illegal market. Consider the many possible sources of
supply for the illegal market:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>sale by legal owners</em></li>

<li><em>theft from legal owners</em></li>

<li><em>smuggling from foreign manufacturers</em></li>

<li><em>manufacture by illegal gunsmiths in the U.S.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Any of these sources could be increased substantially, and
<em>would</em> be increased if a price rise made it profitable.</p>

<h3>The Illegal Market for Handguns</h3>

<p>With an inelastic demand and elastic supply, we get a market
that looks like Figure 4. At a price of P0, the number of firearms
demanded is (Q0).</p>

<p>If the supply of firearms were decreased by the enforcement of
gun control laws, the supply curve would shift to the left. Figure
5 depicts this new market. At the old price (P0), the quantity of
firearms demanded would fall to Q1, if demand were perfectly
elastic. But because demand for firearms is inelastic (unresponsive
to price increases), prices will rise to P2, and the quantity
demanded would fall only slightly to Q2.</p>

<p>If new gun control laws succeeded in reducing the gross quantity
of guns going to the illegal market by 10 percent (before allowing
for price effects), reasonable assumptions produce an estimate of
the net change in the quantity of weapons going to criminals of
less than 2 percent. That is shown in Figure 5 as an initial
quantity of 100 (Q0) and a final quantity of 98 (Q2).</p>

<p>Furthermore, even this small quantity reduction would come from
the illegal purchasers least wedded to their guns: those
<em>least</em> likely to commit violent crimes. The more violent
criminals will still have weapons. As Wright and Rossi have
noted:</p>

<blockquote>Here it may be appropriate to recall the First Law of
Economics, a law whose operation has been sharply in evidence in
the case of Prohibition, marijuana and other drugs, prostitution,
pornography, and a host of other banned activities and
substances--namely, that demand creates its own supply. There is no
evidence anywhere to show that reducing the availability of
firearms in general likewise reduces their availability to persons
with criminal intent, or that persons with criminal intent would
not be able to arm themselves under any set of general restrictions
on firearms.</blockquote>

<p>The conclusion is that changes in the supply of weapons to
criminals induced by restrictions on the general public are
unlikely to result in any noticeable decrease in criminal armament.
Consequently, no noticeable impact on crime will occur.</p>

<h2>Summary and Concluding Remarks</h2>

<p>Between 1973 and 1992, the rate of gun ownership in the U.S.
increased by 45 percent--from 610 guns per 1,000 people to 887. If
firearms caused crime and violence, one should expect to see gun
owners noticeably more criminous and more violent than those who do
not own guns. One finds no such thing. In fact, the population
<em>as a whole</em> has been growing noticeably <em>less</em>
violent.</p>

<p>As criminologists well appreciate, the problem of crime and
violence in this country has become largely concentrated in the
poorest neighborhoods of large and medium-sized cities. Young men,
African Americans in particular, have experienced a startling
increase in victimization over the last decade.</p>

<p>None of this comes as much of a surprise if one considers the
scissors of (1) poor life chances in the middle-class world (owing
to the disintegration of families, poor educational opportunities,
and so on) and (2) growing opportunities in the drug trade that
result from our ever-more-vigorous efforts to suppress drug use by
suppressing supply. The most important reason for criminal behavior
is that the income that offenders can earn in the world of crime,
as compared with the world of work, all too often makes crime
appear to be the better choice.</p>

<p>"We are now reaping the consequences of 30 years spent talking
about guns rather than doing something effective about poverty and
hopelessness," writes David Kopel. "If we really want to reduce the
disease of violence, it is time for us to start thinking about how
to strengthen families and foster individual responsibility, and it
is time to abandon the unscientific crusade against guns."</p>

<p>Firearms are nowhere near the root of the problem of violence
and arguably are almost completely divorced from it. As long as
people come in unlike sizes, shapes, ages, and temperament; as long
as they diverge in their taste for risk and their willingness and
capacity to prey on other people or to defend themselves from
predation; and, above all, as long as some people have little or
nothing to lose by spending their lives in crime, dispositions to
violence will persist--and increasingly strict gun controls will do
little if anything to improve matters.</p>
