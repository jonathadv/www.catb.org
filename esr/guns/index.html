<p>Yes, I cheerfully refer to myself as a gun nut.  Because after I've
done that myself, idiots can't bash me with the phrase.  Since it
doesn't take most people very long to notice that I am not in fact crazy,
this maneuver has the effect of discrediting the idiots.</p>

<p>I've taken some public flak in the hacker community for vocally
supporting firearms rights &mdash; and received a lot of private
support.  It's all about freedom.  It's all about keeping the power to
defend yourself, the power to revolt, the power to <strong>say
no</strong> in the hands of individuals. No hacker should have any
trouble understanding this.</p>

<p>You can read my personal story of <a href="personal.html">how I got
involved with guns</a> here. Or you can read about <a
href="ipscc1.html">my first IPSCC match</a>. Or about <a
href="rig.html">my shooting rig</a>. Or, read the entertaining <a
href='sheep.html'>Parable of the Sheep</a> for an explanation of how
gun owners feel about their guns so simple that even a child can
understand it.</p>

<p>Finally, and most importantly, my essay <a
href="gun-ethics.html">Ethics from the Barrel of a Gun: What Bearing
Weapons Teaches About the Good Life</a></p>

<h1>Scholarly Studies</h1>

<p>Many well-intentioned Americans have been propagandized into
believing a collection of myths that paint guns as intrinsically
evil and demonize gun owners. Fortunately, sociological and
criminological research of very high quality is now available to
refute these myths. Here are some of my favorite items:</p>

<p>The Heartland Institute paper <a href="aiming.html">Taking Aim
At Gun Control</a> does an excellent job of debunking the myths
"everybody knows" about guns and gun control.</p>

<p><a href="gun-control.html">Gun Control: A Realistic
Assessment</a> is a thoroughly scholarly but devastating critique
of partisanship and methodological errors in many commonly-cited
anti-gun sources.</p>

<p>Renowned criminologist Gary Kleck is a card-carrying ACLU member
and liberal Democrat. Unfortunately for left-liberal orthodoxy, he is
also willing to follow the facts wherever they lead. His book
<cite>"Point Blank: Guns and Violence In America"</cite> became the
starting point for all serious scholarly discussion of its topic
soon after it came out in 1991. You can read Kleck's <a
href="point-blank-summary.html">summary of the book</a> here.</p>

<p>The direction of recent research on this topic is well represented
by a 1996 paper from the University of Chicago; Crime, Deterrence, and
Right-to-Carry Concealed Handguns. Only an early draft is <a
href="gunslott.html">available here</a>; Lott has since expanded this
study into an even more compelling book, <cite>"More Guns,Less
Crime:"</cite> (University of Chicago Press, 1998, ISBN
0-226-49363-6). (Some articles by Lott are
available on the web; <a href="http://homepage.usask.ca/~sta575/cdn-firearms/Lott/Lott7.html">Gun
Control Advocates Purvey Deadly Myths</a> is particularly telling, as
is his description of <a
href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,120638,00.html">international
rises in crime rates</a> following gun bans.)</p>

<p>These three papers should convince anyone with a respect for
genuine scientific inquiry that most of what politicians and the
media tell us to believe about ``gun control'' is wrong. (This
should be hardly surprising given both groups' well-earned
reputations for sloppiness and mendacity in other areas.)</p>

<p>Many more good pointers to high-quality research are available
at the <a
href="http://teapot.usask.ca/cdn-firearms/HTML/research2.html">CDN-Firearms
research page</a>.</p>

<h1>Legal Scholarship</h1>

<p>Many good resources are collected at <a
href='http://www.guncite.com/'>GunCite</a>.  I recommend the article
<a href="http://www.guncite.com/journals/reycrit.html">A Critical
Guide to the Second Amendment</a>, an excellent introduction to the
topic.</p>

<h1>Advocacy and Politics</h1>

<p>The founders of the United States (among others) had some
pointed things to say about civilian arms. You can read some of my
favorite <a href="/~esr/fortunes/rkba.html">quotes</a> on this
topic here.</p>

<p>For an excellent discussion of the ethics of gun defense, see <a
href="cowards.html">A Nation Of Cowards</a>. The author contends
that is not only the right but the <em>duty</em> of free people to
be armed and willing to use lethal force in defense of life and
liberty. Washington, Jefferson, and Lincoln would have agreed. So
do I.</p>

<p>My own favorite argument is <a href="reductio.html">here</a>.</p>
