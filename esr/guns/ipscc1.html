<h1 class="c1">Eric Goes IPSCC</h1>

<p>On the last Sunday of July 1998, I finally got to try what I've
been not-so-secretly lusting to do ever since I started potting
targets more than a year ago: tactical pistol shooting.</p>

<p>My wife Cathy and I had recently become members of the Lower
Providence Rod &amp; Gun Club, a flourishing establishment in
Audubon, PA which we selected precisely because it holds regular
tactical shoots on its big outdoor range.</p>

<p>Cathy and I and my trusty Colt .45 automatic and my brand new
fancy leather tactical holster hauled over there on that fine sunny
morning to see what we could see. The first thing we saw was a
range officer telling me to get on up to the clubhouse and have
myself safety-checked.</p>

<p>LPR&amp;GC shoots under IPSCC (International Practical Shooting
Confederation) rules. These require every would-be competitor to be
checked out for safe gun-handling and briefed on the range rules.
This took about half an hour, because these people are just as
careful as they should be.</p>

<p>There I was initiated into the mysteries of ``Load and make
ready...'' ``Fire!'' ``Show clear!'' and the other rituals designed
to ensure that holes only get blown in things that are
<em>supposed</em> to get perforated. I walked away with a little
white IPSCC card certifying me reasonably safe to play with.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, back at the range, the shooters were getting off to
the kind of late start you half expect if you're talking about
organizing thirty or so contestants. I got back as they were
finishing forming into squads, one for each firing stage.</p>

<p>The outdoor course had three stages, to be taken in any order.
The first one opposite my squad consisted mainly of `poppers',
steel silhouette targets on hinged bases. About a dozen of them,
arranged roughly like a set of bowling pins in reverse (point to
the rear). Above the right and left ends of the set, two cardboard
silhouette targets. Range about thirty feet.</p>

<p>Firing instructions for this stage: take out all targets,
freestyle (means you can choose any order, and use whatever grip
and stance you like). To take out a cardboard target, two hits. To
take out a popper, knock it over. The instructions also included
one mandatory reload; means that at least once you have to stop and
change magazines, a time-consuming operation. And that matters,
because the stage is timed, and taking more seconds lowers your
score.</p>

<p>While waiting my turn I chatted with the other people in my
squad. I wasn't shy about this being my first time, and other
shooters responded with a lot of helpful advice. One showed me a
trick called a ``stripper magazine''; you insert it, rack your
slide to chamber a round, drop the slide, drop out the stripper,
and then load another mag. That's one more round you can fire
before first reload.</p>

<p>Another thing I was told is: develop a plan. Look at the
targets, think about how to attack them efficiently, consider when
you'll reload. So I did. Cardboard targets first; reload. Shoot the
center popper first, work my way out to either side. I was ready.
By the time the RO (range officer) put the shooter before me in the
firing box and sang out ``Raymond! On deck!'' I was eager. Then I
was up, with the RO calling out ``Load and make ready!'' by my
right ear. I loaded and holstered my gun, safety on, and reached
gently for the still place inside myself that every martial artist
knows.</p>

<p>Then it was ``Fire!'' and I was in motion. Left cardboard;
<em>one</em>, <em>two</em>. Right cardboard; <em>one</em>,
<em>two</em>. Somewhere far away there was sunlight and explosions
and seconds ticking away, but I was settling into the groove; no
time, no space, just the act. A split second of worry as I lined up
my on the rearmost popper; the cardboard silhouettes were old
friends from the range, but I'd never shot one of these steel
things before. What if I missed? What if it didn't fall over?</p>

<p>But my bullet flew true. Poppers clang when you hit them; the
sound of somebody knocking over a row of poppers quickly can be
almost musical. The sound of that first one falling was certainly
music to <em>my</em> ears. I made quick work of its neighbors and
the rest of the V-shaped back row. The four smaller poppers in the
front row gave me a little more trouble; I missed twice.</p>

<p>Then it was over and I stood there blinking as the RO intoned
``If you're finished shooting, eject, unload and show clear.''
Total objective time no more than ten or twelve seconds. Could have
been a year from the inside.</p>

<p>Nobody looked at me funny or said anything, so I figured I'd
done OK. I watched people reset poppers and tape over my bullet
holes. One of the ROs had me sign my score sheet. I wandered around
a bit, reloaded my mags, and helped reset poppers for the next
couple of shooters. It was turning into a bright, hot day. My .45
felt comfortable on my hip.</p>

<p>In fact, I found that the sight of three dozen people wearing
pistols and casually socializing was curiously bracing. It said
more clearly than words ever could: ``We are adults. We trust
ourselves and each other and take ultimate responsibility for our
actions. We are armed, we know each other fit to be armed, and we
are proud to be so fit.''</p>

<p>I thought then of the historian J. A. Pocock's description of
the beliefs of the Founding Fathers of the U.S: ``The bearing of
arms is the essential medium through which the individual asserts
both his social power and his participation in politics as a
responsible moral being...'' and I felt a flash of pity for the all
the frightened, self-disarmed people who have never understood the
full truth of that. And more than a flash of loathing for the
would-be gun-banners who would rape away their chance to ever
learn.</p>

<p>Indeed, as Robert Heinlein famously observed, an armed society
is a polite society. The gun owners at this match were far from
being the strutting, truculent rednecks of media myth. To the
contrary: I observed, as I generally have at gun shows and ranges,
a kind of bone-deep good manners and degree of mutual respect that
is all too rare elsewhere -- the sort of quiet civility and
open-handedness that used to be called ``good breeding''.</p>

<p>The second stage was the tricky one. Twelve targets, only four
visible from the starting box, the rest hidden by an S-shaped
passage constructed of scrims on stakes. Two cardboards to my far
right, two poppers in front of me, the maze entrance between them.
I took the cardboard targets first, then started on the
poppers.</p>

<p>I heard the first popper clang, but it didn't go down. Again;
clang. Again: clang. Somebody was saying ``Stop him'' and I heard
the RO call ``Halt!''. Jerked out of my concentration, I flinched a
bit. The RO said ``You didn't do anything wrong. We've got a range
malfunction.''</p>

<p>Turned out the popper I was shooting at hadn't been reset
properly. The ROs went to fix it and I went to the back of the line
and waited for another go. One of the guys in my squad gave me a
tube of sweat suppressor that he said would keep my hands dry and
help my grip. Another one advised me to wear a hat next time in
case my .45's ejector dropped some hot brass on my head, but the
sun was showing me a better reason. I was beginning to regret not
bringing sunblock.</p>

<p>Cathy, sensibly sitting in the shade at the back end of the
range, sent me a grin and a thumbs-up. I began to think I'd have to
get her interested in this game so she wouldn't mind hauling off to
more matches with me. There were only two other women in the
squads, one a tall leggy pony-tailed blonde straight out of a
country-western song and the other a middle-aged woman in glasses
who looked like somebody's aunt and was helping the ROs score. They
were both very good -- careful shots, not as fast on the trigger as
the best men but dead-on accurate.</p>

<p>I got my second go about twenty minutes later. Turn right;
cardboard, <em>one</em>, <em>two</em>; cardboard, <em>one</em>,
<em>two</em>; face front and line up the poppers. This time the
left popper went down with a clang, first shot. So did the right
popper -- and it was attached to a pull cord that activated the
fifth target. That one was sitting on a pivot with a pendulum below
it; it swung into visibility from behind the left-hand passage
wall, then swung out again with a period of a second and a half or
so.</p>

<p>This called for exact timing. I lined up my sights, waited for
it to start swinging out, fired, let it swing back, let it start
swinging out again, and gave it a second bullet. Two hits. Then it
was time to reload and charge into the maze, with the RO at my
heels warning me not to ``break 180'' -- that is, never let the
muzzle of my gun swing any wider than parallel to the firing line.
Doing so is an instant ``DQ'' or match disqualification. Safety
again; if you break 180 and have an accidental discharge you could
pot a bystander, which would be bad.</p>

<p>Two corners of the maze were firing positions, revealing several
targets each. All cardboard; I don't think I missed at all, but at
two bullets each I had to reload twice. Fumbled the second one a
bit but recovered. The most fun was another swinger, and two
targets on a seesaw arm that alternately popped up and down from
behind a wall.</p>

<p>Afterwards a scorer told me I had done quite well on the front
targets. Behind me I heard somebody say ``I wish <em>I</em> could
do eight that fast!'', which made me feel pretty good. I guess
there's something to be said for earning a black belt in Tae Kwon
Do before you pick up a pistol.</p>

<p>For the third stage my squad shagged on up to the clubhouse and
the indoor range. This one was timed fire at short range, with two
new wrinkles -- no-shoot targets and hard-cover targets.</p>

<p>No-shoots are shaped just like the ordinary cardboard
silhouettes, but they're white instead of unbleached-cardboard
brown. They represent innocent bystanders in your
combat/crimefighting scenario. Typically, your no-shoots are
deployed right next to or overlapping good targets. You pop them,
you lose points.</p>

<p>A hard-cover target has black zones off the right and left
edges. Hits in the black zones don't count; only the unpainted
stripe down the center is good for a score.</p>

<p>The third stage was three targets: two in front and paired with
overlapping no-shoots, one to the rear with hard-cover zones. I
didn't ask, but the story line was clear -- three bad guys, the
front two with hostages, the back guy semi-concealed or wearing a
flak jacket. The challenge: two hits on each (without popping the
no-shoots), reload, and do it again.</p>

<p>I fluffed it. Had to be reminded to reload and fire the second
six shots, and hit the edge of the right-hand no-shoot once. Ah
well. Put it down to inexperience. I saw really competent shooters
eat this scenario like candy, competing for the fastest time rather
than simply solving the shooting problem....which backs up
criminologist Gary Kleck's statistic in <em>Point Blank: Guns and
Violence In America</em> about armed civilians being five times
less likely to pop an innocent bystander than the police. We're
simply better shots. Enough of us, anyway. :-).</p>

<p>The fourth, back down at the outdoor range stage went
better...even though I was getting pretty seriously broiled at this
point, arms turning red and the top of my head starting to throb. I
hung out in the shade with Cathy while awaiting my turn.</p>

<p>This stage had two shooting boxes, about twelve feet apart. From
the starting one, on the right, you'd see four no-shoots flanked by
two barrels. Behind the right-hand barrel, half-hidden, a brown
target; staggered between the no-shoots, three more. Then you'd run
left to the second box and, hey presto, from the different angle
four new targets would appear behind the left-hand barrel and
between the no-shoots.</p>

<p>Freestyle, two hits each. The first four went well, all clean
hits with no wasted shots. Second four not so good; I fumbled my
reload again and somehow managed to miss the left-hand barrel
target. A lot of fun, though.</p>

<p>The whole shooting match was a lot of fun, pretty close to being
the best time I've ever had with my clothes on. So much so that
Cathy picked up on it watching me. We're going to get her something
like a Glock .40 and a tac holster so she can play in next month's
match instead of just spectating.</p>

<p>By the time we drove home I was sunburned, tired, and blissfully
happy. I didn't know my score, and five days later I still don't;
the results needed to be crunched through somebody's computer and
mailed out, and they're probably somewhere in the bowels of the
postal system as I write. But my score doesn't matter.</p>

<p>I was there. I had a great time. I met my own expectations;
scored clean hits, didn't miss a lot, didn't let the pressure
rattle me too badly. And I'll be back next month. I may not be very
good at this game yet -- but I will be.</p>

<p><em>P.S.: I came in second to last, which I guess counts as a
tactical victory. And Cathy thought it looked like enough fun that
we've gotten her her own Glock .40 and a tac holster...</em></p>
