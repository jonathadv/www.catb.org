<p> Not so long ago and in a pasture too uncomfortably close to here, a 
flock of sheep lived and grazed.  They were protected by a dog, who 
answered to the master, but despite his best efforts from time to time a 
nearby pack of wolves would prey upon the flock. </p>
  
<p>  One day a group of sheep, more bold than the rest, met to discuss their 
dilemma.  "Our dog is good, and vigilant, but he is one dog and the 
wolves are many.   The wolves he catches are not always killed, and the 
master judges and releases many to prey again upon us, for no reason we 
can understand.  What can we do?  We are sheep, but we do not wish to be 
food, too!"</p>
 
<p>  One sheep spoke up, saying "It is his teeth and claws that make the 
wolf so terrible to us.  It is his nature  to prey,  and he would find 
any way to do it, but it is the tools he wields that make it possible.  
If we had such teeth, we could fight back, and stop this savagery." The 
other sheep clamored in agreement, and they went together to the old 
bones of the dead wolves heaped in the corner of the pasture, and 
gathered fang and claw and made them into weapons.</p>
 
<p>That night, when the wolves came, the newly armed sheep sprang up with 
their weapons and struck at them and cried "Begone!  We are not food!" 
and  drove off the wolves, who were astonished.  When did sheep become so 
bold and so dangerous to wolves?  When did sheep grow teeth?  It was 
unthinkable!</p>

<p> The next day, flush with victory and waving their weapons, they 
approached the flock to pronounce their discovery.  But as they drew 
nigh, the flock huddled together and cried out "Baaaaaaaadddd!  Baaaaaddd 
things!  You have bad things!  We are afraid!  You are not sheep!"</p>

<p> The brave sheep stopped, amazed.  "But we are your brethren!" they 
cried, "We are still sheep, but we do not wish to be food.  See, our new 
teeth and claws protect us and have saved us from slaughter.  They do not 
make us into wolves, they make us equal to the wolves, and safe from 
their viciousness!"</p>

<p> "Baaaaaaaddd!", cried the flock,"the things are bad and will pervert 
you, and we fear them.  You cannot bring them into the flock.  They scare 
us!".  So the armed sheep resolved to conceal their weapons, for although 
they had no desire to panic the flock, they wished to remain in the fold. 
 But they would not return to those nights of terror, waiting for the 
wolves to come.</p>
 
<p>  In time, the wolves attacked less often and sought easier prey, for 
they had no stomach for fighting sheep who possessed tooth and claw even 
as they did.  Not knowing which sheep had fangs and which did not, they 
came to leave sheep out of their diet almost completely except for the 
occasional raid, from which more than one wolf did not return.  Then came 
the day when, as the flock grazed beside the stream, one sheep's weapon 
slipped from the folds of her fleece, and the flock cried out in terror 
again, "Baaaaaaddddd!  You still possess these evil things!  We must ban 
you from our presence!".</p>

<p> And so they did.  The great chief sheep and his court and council, 
encouraged by the words of their moneylenders and advisors, placed signs 
and totems at the edges of the pasture forbidding the presence of hidden 
weapons there.  The armed sheep protested before the council, saying "It 
is our pasture, too, and we have never harmed you!  When can you say we 
have caused you hurt?  It is the wolves, not we, who prey upon you.  We 
are still sheep, but we are not food!".  But the flock would not hear, 
and drowned them out with cries of "Baaaaaaddd!  We will not hear your 
clever words!  You and your things are evil and will harm us!". </p>
 
<p>  Saddened by this rejection, the armed sheep moved off and spent their 
days on the edges of the flock, trying from time to time to speak with 
their brethren to convince them of the wisdom of having such teeth, but 
meeting with little success.  They found it hard to talk to those who, 
upon hearing their words, would roll back their eyes and flee, crying 
"Baaaaddd! Bad things!".</p>

<p> That night, the wolves happened upon the sheep's totems and signs, and 
said, "Truly, these sheep are fools!  They have told us they have no 
teeth!  Brothers, let us feed!".  And they set upon the flock, and 
horrible was the carnage in the midst of the fold.  The dog fought like a 
demon, and often seemed to be in two places at once, but even he could 
not halt the slaughter.  It was only  when the other sheep arrived with 
their weapons that the wolves fled, vowing to each other to remain on the 
edge of the pasture and wait for the next time they could prey, for if 
the sheep were so foolish once, they would be so again.  This they did, 
and do still.</p>

<p> In the morning, the armed sheep spoke to the flock, and said, "See?  If 
the wolves know you have no teeth, they will fall upon you.  Why be prey? 
 To be a sheep does not mean to be food for wolves!".  But the flock 
cried out, more feebly for their voices were fewer, though with no less 
terror, "Baaaaaaaadddd!  These things are bad!  If they were banished, 
the wolves would not harm us!  Baaaaaaaddd!".   The other sheep could 
only hang their heads and sigh.  The flock had forgotten that even they 
possessed teeth; how else could they graze the grasses of the pasture?   
It was only those who preyed, like the wolves and jackals, who turned 
their teeth to evil ends.  If you pulled their own fangs those beasts 
would take another's teeth and claws, perhaps even the broad flat teeth 
of sheep, and turn them to evil purposes. </p>
 
<p>  The bold sheep knew that the fangs and claws they possessed had not 
changed them.  They still grazed like other sheep, and raised their lambs 
in the spring, and greeted their friend the dog as he walked among them.  
But they could not quell the  terror of the flock, which rose in them 
like some ancient dark smoky spirit and could not be damped by reason, 
nor dispelled by the light of day.</p>

<p> So they resolved to retain their weapons, but to conceal them from the 
flock; to endure their fear and loathing, and even to protect their 
brethren if the need arose, until the day the flock learned to understand 
that as long as there were wolves in the night, sheep would need teeth to 
repel them.</p>

<p>They would still be sheep, but they would not be food!</p>
