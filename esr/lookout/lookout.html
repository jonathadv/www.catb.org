export files, as produced by Outlook 97 or Outlook Express, to either
the KAB format used by the <b>abbrowser</b> address-book
browser in KDE or the GnomeCard format used by the GNOME address book
application.</p><p>You may select the format to be written with <tt>--kab</tt>
for KAB or <tt>-gc</tt> for GnomeCard.  If you do not select a
format, <b>lookout</b> will try to determine what format
it should translate to by looking for a <tt>~/.kde</tt>
or <tt>~/.gnome</tt> directory.</p><p>Run with a single file argument, <b>lookout</b> will
interpret it as an Outlook address-book export file to be converted,
and write the corresponding KAB- or GnomeCard format address file to
the default location for the calling user's address book. The new
information will be appended to any previously existing address book.</p><p>Run with no arguments, <b>lookout</b> will act as a
filter, translating an Outlook address-book export file presented on
standard input to KAB or GnomeCard address-book data written to standard
output.</p><p>The fields supported by Outlook do not always have exact
equivalents in the output address-book formats that
<b>lookout</b> supports.  Despite this, no information is ever
discarded in translation; <b>lookout</b> inserts
untranslated fields into whatever facility for notes or user-defined
fields the output format supports.</p></div><div class="refsect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><h2>Theory of Operation</h2><p>To export your Outlook address book in the format this
program reads, use the the 'Tab Separated Values (Windows)' export
format.  To generate this export file:</p><div class="procedure"><ol type="1"><li><p> In Outlook (on your Windows machine), select File -&gt;
'Import and Export' to call up the import/export wizard.
</p></li><li><p>
In that wizard, select 'Export to a file', which
should be the second entry of the wizard's first menu.  Press Next to continue.
</p></li><li><p>
Select the &quot;Contacts&quot; folder. Press Next to continue.
</p></li><li><p>
Select 'Tab Separated Values (Windows)'.
This is the last entry in the list; you may have to scroll down to see it.
Press Next to continue.
</p></li><li><p>
Outlook will prompt you for a path and filename to write to.  Supply
one, or accept the default. Press Next to continue.
</p></li><li><p>
Press `Finish' to write the file.
</p></li><li><p> Transfer the
export file to your Unix machine by any available means.  (An
MS-DOS-formatted floppy disk read on your Unix box by
mcopy(1)
will do nicely.)
</p></li></ol></div><p>To use the export file you have just generated in KDE:</p><div class="procedure"><ol type="1"><li><p>Select <b>abbrowser</b>
as your address-book interface.  Note that it is not (at time of
writing) the default address-book interface of KMail.  To enable it,
run <b>kmail</b> select Settings -&gt; Configuration to pull
up the Configuration dialog, then select `Appearance' and select the
`Addressbook' tab.  Change the pulldown from `Traditional Kmail' (the
default) to `Abbrowser'.  
</p></li><li><p>
Make sure that the directory in which your
contact manager expects to find address-book files exists before
running <b>lookout</b>.  The easiest way to make sure is
to run <b>abbrowser</b> once before converting, to
create a dummy address-book file in the right location.
</p></li></ol></div><p>As of KDE 2.1.1 (as shipped in Red Hat 7.1)
<b>abbrowser</b> is the only address-book interface
shipped with KDE which can handle anything like the full set of
Outlook address-book fields.  The KAB format that
<b>lookout</b> writes can be written and read by some
other KDE address books, however.</p><p>Under either KDE or GNOME:</p><div class="procedure"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Run <b>lookout <i><tt>file</tt></i></b>,
replacing <i><tt>file</tt></i> with the actual name of your
Outlook export file.
</p></li><li><p>
Call up your address-book application to verify that the transfer was
successful.
</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="refsect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en"><h2>Files</h2><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><tt>~/.kde/share/apps/kab/addressbook.kab</tt></span></dt><dd><p>

other KDE address book plugins.

1.2.0 of <b>gnomecard</b> and the KDE 2.1.1 version of 
<b>abbrowser</b>.  Future versions of these addressbook 
applications may add more fields matching Outlook fields.  Therefore,
you should check which version of your addressbook you are using;
it may be that a more up-to-date version of <b>lookout</b>
will do a better semantic translation, relegating less data to the
notes or extension fields.  You can find the latest version of
<b>lookout</b> at the <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/lookout/" target="_top">lookout project page</a>.
