<i>&gt; Christos, I assume you want to help.  Right?  You're the one with the</i><br>
<i>&gt; real experience with file(1).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; We might also want to bring in Greg Roelofs &lt;newt@uchicago.edu&gt;.  He</i><br>
<i>&gt; designed the magic for PNG and might have a few good ideas.</i><br>
<p>
I'll set up a mailing list including you, Christos, Greg, and me and<br>
issue a charter posting.<br>
<p>
FYI, here's what I've roughed up as an intro to the draft.<br>
<p>
============================================================================<br>
Cross-platform file export through means like public FTP directories has long<br>
been an important mechanism of Internet information sharing.  More recently,<br>
the growth of the Internet has been driven by technologies such as the <br>
World Wide Web, which give it (among other things) the aspect of a single<br>
huge distributed file store.<br>
<p>
In such an environment, it is very desirable that files should<br>
generally present themselves as self-describing objects from which a<br>
navigation tool can readily deduce both their uses and at least some<br>
of the semantics of their contents. An effective set of such<br>
conventions can enable tools such as Web browsers to inform users<br>
according to such deductions, and to dispatch to appropriate<br>
sub-interpreters and user agents on the file object's semantic type.<br>
<p>
The Internet's major operating systems have traditionally shared two<br>
means of ad-hoc semantic typing for files.  The better known is the<br>
quasi-systematic use of file name "extensions" to carry semantic<br>
information (most Internet habitues, for example would feel<br>
justifiably surprised if a file with extension ".gif" were not to<br>
contain picture data in the well-known Graphic Interchange Format).<br>
Standardization of such file name extensions would be a desirable goal,<br>
but very complex and beyond the scope of this RFC.<br>
<p>
The other, prevalent especially under Unix, is the quasi-systematic<br>
use of "magic numbers" in binary-format files.  Many Unix binary <br>
formats have an initial segment of fixed pattern intended to uniquely<br>
identify the file type for the purposes of loaders, linkers, graphics<br>
viewers, and other tools.<br>
<p>
The purpose of this RFC is threefold:<br>
<p>
(1) To enunciate guidelines and design principles appropriate when choosing <br>
    magic numbers for a new file type.<br>
 <br>
(2) To advertise a central Internet registry of "magic numbers", with<br>
    procedures for checking candidate segment patterns against the registry<br>
    and for claiming new patterns.<br>
<p>
(3) To define a new standards-compliance category of MAGIC programs (MAGIC =<br>
    "Magic Awareness 'Gainst Internet Complexity") which are required to <br>
    be aware, in certain well-defined ways, of registered magic numbers.<br>
============================================================================<br>
<p>
Yes, I know the acronym is weak.  Suggestions for improvement welcomed.<br>
