6 Mountain

4 War Mammoths          (the heavies)
4 Scryb Sprites

4 Giant Growths
2 Tranquility

6 Forest

4 Drudge Skeletons      (the blockers)

This is 60 cards and tournament-legal straight up.  Optional additions:

1 Maze Of Ith           (adds a bit more defensive oomph)

My retuning of a design for me by Jeff Tamulis -- the original was a
bit creature-poor.

This is a nasty, fast deck.  Often (42% chance), a Scryb Sprite or
Kird Ape will come out on turn 1.  Almost as often, you'll be able
to start trashing your opponent's lands by turn 2 or 3.

Use the Howls From Beyond and Giant Growths on your War Mammoths, if
possible, to boost their trample damage.
