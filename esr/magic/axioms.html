<h1 class="c1">Alodar's Axioms</h1>

<p>Heed well, O Duelist, these simple rules, and your name will be
spoken with respect (and perhaps fear) wheresoever in Dominia that
mages gather.</p>

<p>The central problem of deck construction is to reduce the
randomness of outcomes inherent in the shuffle, cut, and ante. This
leads directly to three guiding principles:</p>

<h1>Primus: A Large Deck Is A Random Deck</h1>

<p>The more cards thou hast in thy deck, the longer average time
thou canst expect to need to fill in critical combinations (as, in
the simplest case, mana plus spells).</p>

<p>herefore, O student, number thyself not among the weenies who
confuse the size of their decks with the size of their di... er,
generative organs. Keep your decks small.</p>

<p>Thy decks should consist of a viable 60-card base (to be
tourney-legal) plus an optional few (as in, a small handful) of
extras.</p>

<p>Resist stringently the impulse to construct larger decks; it
will magnify thy losses. Resist also the temptation to construct
smaller decks for non-tournament play; it will unfit thee for
tourneys.</p>

<h1>Secundus: Duplication Is The Sincerest Form Of Flattening</h1>

<p>He is truly a fool who stakes the outcome of a duel on seeing
some one particular card before he is dispatched.</p>

<p>Therefore, thy critical card types (whether they be creatures,
magic, or anything else) should appear in thy decks in twos,
threes, and fours.</p>

<h1>Tertius: Rarities Are Traps</h1>

<p>It is beyond the means of any but the most fanatic mages to
assemble multiple copies of a truly rare spell or artifact. But if
thou reliest on singleton rarities, thy decks will become
excessively dependent on the luck of the shuffle and ante draw.</p>

<p>Design, therefore, with thy rarities in the `optional extras'
column; use them to accelerate and intensify the base deck's theme
and nature, rather than attempting to use them as main cards or to
plug the holes in the remainder of the construction.</p>

<p>Dominia is replete with artifact weenies. While they squabble
over glittering trash that will usually be lurking in the
inaccessible bottoms of their decks when most needed, you can be
quietly building decks that will win. And win. And win again.</p>

<h1>Lesser Principles</h1>

<p>The three great Axioms you violate at your peril. Other
principles there are which, while they may be creatively broken by
the advanced mage, will hold true most of the time.</p>

<h1>Two Colors Suffice</h1>

<p>Decks which attempt to work three or more colors will generally
leave the duelist short of all the kinds of mana. Monochrome decks
are too easily neutralized by Circles of Protection, and very
vulnerable to catastrophes like Tsunami or Conversion.</p>

<p>Therefore, design thy decks around two colors. Often it will
naturally ensue that one color is creature-heavy while the other is
magic-heavy. This is no bad thing, but have some of both in both
colors, lest thou findest either color stopped.</p>

<h1>Heed Both the Great and the Small</h1>

<p>It is a quick path to defeat to have exclusively large, costly
creatures in one's battalions. One will too often be crushed while
waiting to accumulate the mana required to summon them.</p>

<p>It is often merely a slower path to ignominy to have only small
creatures in one's train. It is bootless to be able to summon many
minions reliably if the result is only that they are destroyed
seriatim before thou canst accumulate an overwhelming mob of
them.</p>

<p>Therefore: when allotting creatures to a deck, include a balance
of both "lights" and "heavies". Better yet, in colors that permit
it, include a balanced set of "lights", "mediums" and
"heavies".</p>

<p>Thy goal is to ensure that, as often as possible, you will both
be able to summon a "light" by the second turn and be able to field
a "medium" or "heavy" creature by the fourth or fifth -- ideally,
with no unused mana at any stage.</p>

<p>Available mana that is not usable represents a waste, a lost
opportunity. Accordingly, there should be a smooth rise of creature
costs to match thy rise in available mana as the duel
progresses.</p>

<h1>Make Your Magic Support Your Creatures</h1>

<p>It is a commonplace among duelists that creatures are more
efficient at delivering damage than sorceries; spells, therefore,
should be chosen primarily to support and protect your
creatures.</p>

<p>Thus, in general, Unholy Strength is a better investment than
(say) Lightning Bolt. You will only get to use Lightning Bolt once,
while a strengthened creature may deal damage for many turns.</p>

<h1>Keep an Eye on the Sky</h1>

<p>All too many duelists have built otherwise-excellent fighting
decks, then watched death fall upon them from the air because their
card mix failed to block flyers.</p>

<p>If thy chosen colors do not offer many fliers, it is worth
having multiples of one or two quick-kill spells specifically for
stopping fliers. <em>This</em> is a good use for Lightning
Bolts.</p>

<h1>Alodar's Formula</h1>

<p>Here is a template for a strong dueling deck. This is not the
only way to build a good deck, but it works well.</p>

<p>Pick two colors. Call one the primary and the other the
secondary. Thy creatures should look like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>4 primary-color "heavies" (creatures of 4/X and up)</li>

<li>4 primary-color "mediums" (2/X and 3/X creatures)</li>

<li>4 primary-color "lights" (1/1 creatures)</li>

<li>4 secondary-color "mediums" (2/X creatures)</li>

<li>4 secondary-color "lights" (1/1 creatures)</li>
</ul>

<p>That's twenty creatures. Now add ten mana in each color. Thou
art up to forty cards. Thou hast twenty slots remaining for
enchantments and sorceries. In choosing these, select multiples
from the following categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>Creature enhancements (Strength, Firebreathing, Invisibility,
etc.)</li>

<li>Quick kills (Terror, Disintegrate, etc.)</li>

<li>Healing, Regeneration, Resurrection</li>

<li>Land denial (Sinkhole, Stone Rain, Phantasmal Land, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Try to spread your spells across all these categories for a
well-balanced deck.</p>

<p>Finally, add no more than five specials. Specials are rarities
and singletons. Thou shouldst design thy deck to win without these;
their purpose is to accelerate thy victory, intimidate thy
opponent, and add an aesthetic frisson to the duel.</p>
