This is 65 cards, which is larger than I like a base deck to get.  But
we've found by experience that it works quite well.

This deck was designed by Cathy Olanich with Alodar's advice.  It has
been extensively battle-tested.

The Goblin War Drums are the key to this deck.  There's a 24% chance you'll
have one in your hand on turn 2.  They make your red creatures pretty hard
to block.

The original version of this deck had a few more creatures, but lacked the
four Goblin Grenades.  It's been re-tuned to use them.  Five points of direct
damage for one mana is tough to beat.

Optional cards:

1 Goblin King
Maze of Ith             (helps on defence)
Dwarven Stronghold      (remove a Mountain if you add this)
Delif's Cone
