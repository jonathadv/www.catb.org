Green Plague

4 Craw Wurm             (the heavy artillery)
4 Giant Spider          (to block flyers)
2 War Mammoth
2 Thallid
2 Thorn Thallid
2 Llanowar Elves

4 Tranquility           (use these against Green & Black CoPs)
2 Giant Growth
2 Fog
2 Wild Growth

11 Forest

4 Plague Rats           (the sneaky left hook)
2 Drudge Skeletons      (use these to block opponent's heavy hitters)

2 Terror
2 Fear                  (cast these on your Craw Wurms if possible)
2 Drain Life
2 Weakness

9 Swamp

This is 60 cards and tournament-legal straight up.  Optional additions:

1 Wall of Brambles      (you can sub this for Wall of Wood)
1 Soul Net              (you win every time opponent kills Thallid spawn)
1 Dark Heart of the Wood

The green creatures are offense, the black creatures defense.  I find that
it's pretty typical to see three Plague Rats come out during the game; with
luck, your opponent will get suckered into using his quick-kill cards on them
and end up naked to the claws and teeth of your Craw Wurms.
