Them Bones

4 Frozen Shades
4 Plague Rats
4 Drudge Skeletons           (cast your Strengths on these)

2 Sinkhole                   (get more Terrors if you can't get these)
2 Terror
1 Drain Life
2 Unholy Strength
2 Death Ward

10 Swamp

4 Pearled Unicorn
4 Mesa Pegasus              (also good Stength targets)

2 Holy Strength
2 Death Ward
2 Disenchant
1 Circle of Protection: Black
1 Circle of Protection: White
1 Circle of Protection: Blue
1 Circle of Protection: Green
1 Circle of Protection: Red

10 Plains

60 cards, tournament legal.  Some optional extras:

1 Soul Net
1 Icatian Scout         (for the first strike)
1 Clay Statue
1 Maze of Ith           (shore up your defenses)
1 Wall of Swords

Another sucker-punch deck.  Your Shades and Plague Rats soak up the
opponent's quick-kills, but amped-up Drudge Skeletons or Mesa Pegasi
will do the real damage.

The Holy Strengths pair with the Unholy Strengths; the Death Wards pair
with the Raise Deads.  The idea is that you'll be able to do roughly
the same sorts of things regardless of whether you've got mostly
white or black cards out.
