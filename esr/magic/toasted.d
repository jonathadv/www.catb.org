The ultimate cheesehead deck.  Not a subtle concept.  Note the complete
absence of defensive spells, creatures, life-gainers, or anything but
flaming direct damage.

Oh.  Well, there are those two Anarchies.  Use 'em on COP Reds.

This deck works far too well.  It makes a dandy test deck; if your designs
can survive it, they're good.

60 cards, tournament-legal as-is.  I don't usually add specials or
bouncers to this deck.  They would compromise its brutal simplicity.
