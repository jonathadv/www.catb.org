1 Oasis

This was an experiment in trying to build a really fast white weenie
deck (it was inspired by a Jeff Tamulis design he called "Speed
Kills").  14 of the 20 creatures (all but the Mesa Pegasi and the
Order of Leithburs) have casting cost of 1.  The theory was to develop
them so fast that opponents would be mobbed before their heavies could
roll over the swarm.

It was a qualified failure (not a dead loss but definitely a less than
50% win score).  Too often, the swarm would get stopped by fast-developing
regenerating 1/1s or ordinary 2/2s.   The concept may be workable, though,
so Alodar is keeping this deck around for future mutation...
