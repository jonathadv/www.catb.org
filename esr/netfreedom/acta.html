<h1 class="c1">An Open Letter to the FCC Commissioners</h1>

<p>The following is a response to the FCC Common Carrier Bureau's
solicitation of comments on RM 8775, the ACTA Internet Phone
Petition.</p>

<p>On March 8, 1996, the America's Carriers Telecommunication
Association (ACTA) requested a declaratory ruling, special relief,
and institution of a rulemaking procedure with regard to so-called
"Net-Phone" services; software and hardware which permit voice
transmission between any two Internet hosts using Internet TCP/IP
transmission as a medium. ACTA requests that the FCC immediately
put a stop to this activity pending the installation of what it
deems an appropriate regulatory regime.</p>

<p>More information is available at the <a
href="http://www.fcc.gov/hottopic.html#acta">FCC's Web Page on the
ACTA Petition</a>, including a copy of the ACTA petition and of the
FCC's solicitation for comments. How to submit comments by email is
also explained. (The period for comments has expired.)</p>

<p>The following is my letter of comment to the FCC Commissioners
on this matter.</p>

<hr />
<p>Honorable Commissioners:</p>

<p>I write to you today as an Internet user of twenty years'
standing and an Internet technologist, one of the technical people
who help make the Internet culture work and have worked hardest to
bring its benefits to ordinary people. To learn about my
Internet-access projects and their fruits, I invite you to browse
my Web page at <a
href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr">http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr</a>.</p>

<p>I write to state that I am appalled that the FCC is even
considering action on the ACTA petition designated as RM8775, re
Internet Net-Phone technology.</p>

<p>I have no stake in any Net-Phone service. I've never used a
net-phone. I am, in economic terms, a wholly disinterested party.
But I cannot stand idly by while ACTA argues for the suppression
and regulatory strangulation of an entire class of technologies to
protect the profit margins of its members, adding insult to injury
by cloaking this self-serving manipulation in a hypocritical appeal
to the "public" interest.</p>

<p>Where would we be today if, in 1896, the manufacturers of buggy
whips had banded together to petition the government to keep the
infant technology of the automobile off U.S. roads, lest it imperil
the economic position of the carriage-making industry?</p>

<p>Considering the growth of U.S. population and travel since then,
the proper answer is probably "knee deep in horseshit". Which
phrase eloquently expresses the way I felt after having read the
ACTA petition.</p>

<p>In the remainder of this letter, I shall demolish ACTA's special
pleading point by point, then turn to some more general but very
relevant considerations regarding Internet regulation.</p>

<h2>The myth of "free service".</h2>

<p>First, ACTA submits "that it is not in the public interest to
permit long distance service to be given away, depriving those who
must maintain the telecommunications infrastructure of the revenue
to do so"</p>

<p>No one is proposing that long-distance service be "given away";
users of net-phones will still pay the cost of their Internet
connections to Internet service providers, who will have every
incentive to "maintain the telecommunications infrastructure"
because that's what ISPs use, too.</p>

<p>Transparently, what ACTA really objects to is the inevitable
shift of customer choice and revenues away from time-metered
service over voice circuits protected by regulatory barriers to
entry, and towards a wide-open free market in flat-rate Internet
connections carrying voice, data and multimedia communications at
lower cost than ACTA's members can offer. No construction of the
"public interest" can justify attempting to thwart this natural
evolution.</p>

<h2>ACTA's invocation of existing regulation ignores its
goals.</h2>

<p>ACTA continues "nor is it in the public interest for these
select telecommunications carriers to operate outside the
regulatory requirements applicable to all other carriers." In
making this argument, ACTA blatantly ignores the goals of the
regulations that it cites so piously.</p>

<p>47 U.S.C. Sections 203 and 214 set up as a public-policy
objective the encouragement of cheap universal telecommunications
service. The continuing development of a robust, market-driven
Internet supporting lower-cost universal voice communications among
its many other facilities is clearly in the public interest defined
by cited statute.</p>

<p>ACTA's attempt to protect the profit margins of its members by
coercive regulatory fiat amounts to a form of market-rigging, and
is just as clearly <em>against</em> that public interest.</p>

<p>All other FCC regulations and statutes pursuant to 47 U.S.C
203/214 are mere mechanics pursuant to these public-policy
objectives, and provide no independent grounds for satisfying
ACTA's oligolopolistic desires.</p>

<h2>The bogus "threat" to customary Internet traffic.</h2>

<p>ACTA continues: "The misuse of the Internet as a way to bypass
the traditional means of obtaining long distance service could
result in a significant reduction of the Internet's ability to
handle the customary types of Internet traffic."</p>

<p>These crocodile tears for "customary" traffic are unconvincing
even as a narrow technical objection. ACTA knows full well that
Internet and voice traffic now use essentially the same inter-LATA
infrastructure of 56K and higher-capacity digital connections. The
complete replacement of voice inter-LATA calls by net-phone
connections would therefore not imply contention for separate
Internet capacity, but merely a customer-driven reallocation of
fungible existing capacity. It would have marginal or zero effect
on "customary" traffic.</p>

<p>ACTA's real concern is that said customer-driven reallocation
would force them out of high-margin voice business into low-margin
packet-transfer business. Absent a solid finding that
packet-transfer profit margins could not sustain the
telecommunications infrastructure, this concern is no business of
the FCC's. And no such finding could possibly be justified as long
as carriers are seeking Internet customers in order to make a
profit on them!</p>

<h2>False analogy to finite radio spectrum.</h2>

<p>ACTA attempts to buttress the preceding "crowding-out" argument
by analogizing Internet capacity to the radio spectrum. The
petition continues: "The Commission has historically protected the
public interest by allocating finite communications
resources/frequencies and organizing communications traffic."</p>

<p>Developing new radio spectrum (or tighter modulation techniques
for old spectrum) is expensive and difficult. Internet capacity is
cheap and easy to build, almost absurdly so -- indeed, the low cost
of additional bandwidth is the economic root of the threat ACTA
perceives. While both are technically finite, the difference in
incremental cost of developing new bandwidth is so great that to
analogize Internet capacity to scarce radio-spectrum space is
transparently nonsense.</p>

<p>The FCC has no mission to allocate Internet bandwidth because
the public need for growth in Internet bandwidth is being
effectively served by the market. ACTA's argument on this specific
amounts to a groundless plea that the FCC ignore economic
facts.</p>

<h2>Appeal to "tariffs concerning unlawful uses".</h2>

<p>ACTA completes its wretched exercise in special pleading with a
flourish of humbug by appealing to the FCC's duty to suppress
unlawful uses such as "gambling, obscenity, prostitution, drug
traffic, and other illegal acts."</p>

<p>Suppose we agree to leave aside both the doubtful enforceability
of such regulations even in existing media and the dubious
constitionality of those relating at least to victimless crimes.
ACTA's argument is nevertheless flawed. It amounts specifically to
a call for enforcement of standards against net-phone users which
(by assumption of the argument) would not be enforced against the
same users engaging in non-voice communication of the same
material, even over the same portions of telecommunications
infrastructure!</p>

<p>Constitutional case law strenuously prohibits the Federal
government from underbroad regulation of this kind. Either the
FCC's responsibility requires it to attempt to control <em>all</em>
Internet speech relating to "gambling, obscenity, prostitution,
drug traffic, and other illegal acts", or the FCC is absolved from
attempting to duplicate the functions of the FBI, DEA and BATF
because the Internet as a whole is impractical to police.</p>

<p>An attempt at selective regulation against net-phone users would
constitute a forbidden discrimination between classes of speakers.
Nor is this merely a theoretical point -- does the FCC really want
to invite suit against net-phone regulation under the
equal-protection clause by advocates for the blind?</p>

<p>Morally, ACTA's posturing as a would-be defender of "family
values" in pursuit of its narrow economic interests is perhaps the
most contemptible single tactical maneuver in this petition. It is
crass and cynical and ultimately rather pathetic.</p>

<p>(This completes the rebuttal of ACTA's arguments. Points
following are general challenges not specifically related to the
particulars of RM8775.)</p>

<h2>Net-phone regulation would be unenforceable</h2>

<p>Net-phone technology is primarily software. The hardware
(microphones and speakers) necessary to capture and relay voice
communications is already ubiquitous on personal computers for
other reasons. The algorithms required to compress and packetize
speech are well-known and implementations are widely available as
free software. The hardware assistance provided by some commercial
net-phone products is useful but by no means essential.</p>

<p>It follows that hypothetical FCC prohibitions or restrictions on
net-phone technology would be unenforceable. Locking out commercial
products would merely hand development of net-phones to a
technology underground, and brokering of net-phone time to a black
market. This could lead to all the bad consequences we are familiar
with from other kinds of prohibition.</p>

<h2>Net-phone regulation would be rejected by the Internet
culture</h2>

<p>The FCC must be aware that, more than other media, the Internet
plays host to many communities of interest; further, that the
Internet itself is no tabula rasa passively awaiting guidance but a
huge community of interests with its own traditions, shared values,
and attitudes. As the present maintainer of the Jargon File (<a
href="http://www.tuxedo.org/jargon">http://www.tuxedo.org/jargon</a>),
a widely-recognized and even venerated compendium of Internet
folklore, I can speak with some authority on the substance of these
values.</p>

<p>I am confident that most informed Internet users share my
rejection of ACTA's arguments and my passion for a free and diverse
Internet supporting an unfettered free market in net-phones and all
the other kinds of services we can conceive and build. Among
Internet technologists and other core members of the culture, I
predict that virtually all will reject net-phone regulation.</p>

<p>Indeed, many Internetters would regard the undermining of such
regulation (and all other regulation that in their view threatens
free expression on the net) as a semi-obligatory form of civil
disobedience, a positive duty in defense of liberty.</p>

<p>In support of this perhaps startling assertion, I suggest the
FCC consider the nearly universal popular support on the Internet
for campaigns of active civil disobedience against the regulations
on export of cryptographic "munitions" and against the
Communications Decency Act.</p>

<p>The implication that the net would also actively resist the FCC
content regulation incidentally called for in the ACTA petition is
intended. As one of our tribal elders once observed, "The Internet
interprets censorship as damage and routes around it."</p>

<h2>Net-phone regulation would be rejected by a broad majority of
voice users</h2>

<p>As the Internet become more ubiquitous, packet-traffic costs
drop, and the margins between net-phone rates and voice tariffs
rise, users of voice telecommunications will experience steadily
increasing incentives to flout FCC's net-phone regulations and
escape FCC tariff structures.</p>

<p>In the absence of either totalitarian force majeure or a
widely-accepted ethical argument to justify FCC regulation, these
pressures will certainly prove irresistible. No one wants the
former and ACTA has not supplied and will not supply the
latter.</p>

<p>Net-phone regulation would, therefore, eventually collapse
politically as well as technologically.</p>

<h2>Harm from attempted suppression or regulation.</h2>

<p>Before the collapse, net-phone regulation would inflict much
harm.</p>

<ul>
<li>Economic harm to consumers, by requiring them to buy inter-LATA
voice services at higher cost than offered by net-phones.</li>

<li>Economic harm to investors and businesses, by encouraging
malinvestment in obsolete voice-only equipment and voice-carrier
organizations.</li>

<li>Harm to the authority of the FCC and the U.S. Government
pursuant to any decision to enforce bad regulations and unpopular
law.</li>

<li>Harm to the civil fabric and the respect for rule of law, from
causes similar to but more general than the foregoing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>In conclusion...</h2>

<p>Neither ACTA nor the FCC (assuming it is so minded) can turn
back the technological tide. Net-phone regulation cannot be
ethically justified, would be popularly rejected, and eventually
would not stand. While in force, it would inflict substantial harm
on the American public and body politic.</p>

<p>I therefore urge the Commissioners to reject the ACTA petition.
I further urge that the Commissioner's refusal express the sense
that the FCC will not in future entertain petitions for declaratory
rulings or rulemaking premised on an Internet threat to the profits
of older media.</p>

<hr />
<p>The preceding was submitted to the FCC Commissioners on March
26th 1996.</p>

<p>On October 16, 1996 I received the following update from Kevin
Werbach, the FCC's Counsel for New Technology Policy:</p>

<p>There has been no formal action on the ACTA petition since we
solicited public comment back in March. However, Reed Hundt, the
Chairman of the FCC, has given several speeches opposing the
application of traditional regulatory rules to Internet telephony.
They are available in <a
href="http://www.fcc.gov/Speeches/Hundt">&lt;http://www.fcc.gov/Speeches/Hundt/&gt;</a>;
the primary ones are the 9/18 Wall St. Journal conference and the
6/28 INET conference.</p>

<p>Here's a representative quote, from Mr. Hundt's speech on
September 18th to the Wall Street Journal Businesds and Technology
Conference:</p>

<p>"It is natural that the companies with monopoly market power
will try to keep that power unless governments through rules
constrain their potential anticompetitive impulses. So that's why
Congress, in the Telecommunications Act of 1996, asked the FCC to
write new rules of competition. But let's be clear: our ultimate
goal is to reach the sunny uplands of deregulated markets in which
the prices and output of telecom services, like software and soap,
are set by markets and not governments."</p>

<p>And another from his June 28th speech to the INET
conference:</p>

<p>"I am also strongly inclined to believe that the right answer at
this time is not to place restrictions on software providers, or to
subject Internet telephony to the same rules that apply to
conventional circuit-switched voice carriers. On the Internet,
voice traffic is just a particular kind of data, and imposing
traditional regulatory divisions on that data is both
counterproductive and futile. Even if most of the FCC wasn't
working around the clock on implementation of the
Telecommunications Act, I can't imagine that we would have the time
to keep track of all the bits passing over the Internet to separate
the "acceptable" data packets from the "unacceptable" voice
packets."</p>

<p>"More importantly, we shouldn't be looking for ways to subject
new technologies to old rules. Instead, we should be trying to fix
the old rules so that if those new technologies really are better,
they will flourish in the marketplace. For years, some engineers
have been telling us that voice over a packet switched network
wasn't possible. The latency periods were too great, they said, and
you'd never get acceptable quality. Well, it is going to be
possible, and in the short period of time since the first
commercial products became available, the quality has been rapidly
improving. But the last thing we want to do is stop that
improvement by thoughtless regulation."</p>

<p>As of late January the FCC has not acted on RM 8775. Looks like
you lose, ACTA scum! :-)</p>
