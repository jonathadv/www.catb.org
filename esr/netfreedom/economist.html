<h1 class="c1">Two Letters To The Economist</h1>

<p><em>I wrote the first in response to their 19 Oct 1996 leader.
"Why The Net Should Grow Up"</em></p>

<p>As an Internet user for twenty years, an expert in several of
its underlying technologies, and a close observer of the Internet
industry, I was profoundly disappointed by your Oct 19th leader and
special article. They were factually incorrect, logically flawed,
and (for a magazine with <cite>The Economist</cite>'s traditions)
astonishingly illiberal.</p>

<p>The central economic contention in these articles rests on a
myth, one which your writer might have usefully exploded had he
investigated why the "barter" system you describe has been so
effective to date. In fact (and despite the rather crocodilian
tears shed in public by large national carriers) the central
economic problem for ISPs has almost never been the cost of
bit-piping; rather, it is the cost of the technicians and service
people needed to maintain the network and support the customers.
These costs are not proportional to bit volume; instead they rise
(rather less punishingly) with network complexity. This is why
peering and fixed settlements work economically, because the cost
profile of large and small ISPs is much more alike than the
disparity in their traffic statistics might suggest.</p>

<p>Far from being under threat, the Internet model of flat-rate
pricing seems certain to spread to more traditional media as cheap
bandwidth disrupts their traditional demand assumptions and
technological improvements assimilate their cost profiles to the
Internet's. Your leader could have observed that this is already
beginning to happen to voice carriers.</p>

<p>From bad economics your leader segues to worse politics.
Certainly the government "should not treat the Internet differently
from other communications media, merely because it is new". The
<cite>Economist</cite> betrays its own heritage, however, if it
interprets this as an argument for regulating Internet content,
rather than abolishing government control of older media.</p>

<p><em>On 21 Apr 1997 I followed up with this:</em></p>

<p>As one of the "wireheads" you cited in "Why the Internet failed
to collapse" (19 April 1997), I found your editorial admission that
the Internet is growing from strength to strength most gratifying.
I invite you to publicly re-examine in this light the wrongheaded
projections of your 19 October 1996 leader. "Why The Net Should
Grow Up".</p>

<p>The text of my previous letter to you on this subject is
available at http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/netfreedom/economist.html.
AOL's well-publicized troubles illustrate the fact that the Net's
problems have little or no relation to the cost of bandwidth, and
AOL's response demonstrates that abandoning flat-rate pricing is
neither necessary nor sufficient to solve those problems.</p>

<p>Any cost or expected-outage model that is hypnotized by bit
volume is doomed to miss its mark. Bandwidth is cheap. Even
<em>reliable</em> bandwidth is cheap, and getting cheaper.
Tellingly, the AOL outage and others like it didn't stem from
undercapacity, but from configuration errors by their network
administrators.</p>

<p>The Internet's central economic problem remains the cost of
competent support people, including the salaries of "wireheads"
like me. Volume pricing won't solve this problem; all it could do
is raise the bar in the bidding war for experienced network
hackers, a pool that is expanding at a rate relatively independent
of network growth.</p>

<p>While I would find this result personally lucrative, I would
prefer to see flat-rate pricing stay in place and salaries bid up
only slowly, so that barriers to entry for new competitors remain
relatively low. This will better serve both my long-term interests
and those of the public.</p>
