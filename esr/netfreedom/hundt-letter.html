<h1 class="c1">An Open Letter to Reed Hundt, Chairman of the
FCC</h1>

<p>Mr. Chairman Hundt:</p>

<p>I'm responding to your request, in your September 18th speech to
the Wall Street Journal Business and Techology Conference, for
input on the direction of U.S. telecommunications and regulatory
policy.</p>

<p>Allow me to present my credentials for addressing these
issues:</p>

<p>First: I have been using the Internet since 1976, back in the
pre-TCP/IP days when it was called ARPAnet. Today I am an expert
Internet technologist actively involved in the development of
Internet tools and standards. For details on my many free-software
and network-service projects, see my home page at &lt;<a
href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr">http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr</a>&gt;.</p>

<p>Second: As the editor of the Jargon File &lt;<a
href="http://www.tuxedo.org/jargon">http://www.tuxedo.org/jargon</a>&gt;,
(and its book version "The New Hacker's Dictionary", ISBN
0-262-68092-0) I am recognized as one of the major chroniclers of
the Internet's culture both within that culture and outside it. My
work has been written up in <cite>Time</cite>,
<cite>Newsweek</cite>, and <cite>Wired</cite>, and
<cite>People</cite> Magazine's October 21st 1996 issue just ran a
profile of me titled "The Guru of Geek-Speak".</p>

<p>Third: I have spent much of the last three years tackling the
community Internet access problem personally. In 1993 I helped
found Chester County InterLink (CCIL). This volunteer-run nonprofit
organization offers an hour a day of free Internet access to anyone
who lives or works in Chester County, PA (where I live). We
concentrate on reaching the people commercial Internet service
providers (ISPs) don't -- the elderly, the poor, minority ethnic
groups, and the disabled.</p>

<p>In a previous speech, you had (I think very incisively) framed
the policy challenge in terms of five questions. I'd like to offer
answers to these based on my twenty years of experience -- of
having watched the Internet grow from a private sandbox for me and
a handful of other techies to a world-transforming mass medium.</p>

<p>While some of my remarks will seem radical, even provocative to
many, I assure you that they represent a strain of opinion widely
prevalent among old Internet hands. Indeed I can assert with some
confidence (from my vantage point as a chronicler of Internet
culture and folklore) that they represent at least a plurality, and
quite possibily a majority, of informed opinion among those who
actually built the Internet and keep it running and growing
today.</p>

<h2>1. How can public policy promote or at least not deter
expansion of bandwidth to power up the development of the
Internet?</h2>

<p>I believe public policy can best serve current and potential
Internet users (and users of all other media) simply by getting out
of their way.</p>

<p>First, the U.S. government should withdraw itself both from
economic regulation of media and from content regulation of
media.</p>

<p>Second, it should move speedily to redefine
electromagnetic-spectrum slots and all other forms of
government-controlled telecomms monopoly resources as tradable
property on the model of land ownership (with interference problems
treated as property torts).</p>

<p>Third, it should dispose of its property by (a) recognizing the
homesteading rights of nonprofit organizations like the American
Radio Relay League, and (b) disposing of the remainder by public
auction to for-profit corporations, with proceeds from the latter
being used to buy down the Federal debt.</p>

<p>Finally, it should celebrate and ratify these successes by
abolishing the FCC.</p>

<p>I will develop arguments for details of this program in the
course of answering your remaining four questions. But the general
grounds for it is this: the whole of the public-interest and
national-security rationale for government intervention in the
telecommunications industry (as codified in the FCC's 1934 enabling
legislation) depends on the assumption of scarce bandwidth and
relatively expensive communications, a regime naturally conducive
to monopolization. That assumption no longer holds.</p>

<p>I submit that your own public meditations on this trend do not
go far enough. You recognize that abundant cheap bandwidth over the
Internet wire makes nonsense of traditional regulatory assumptions
about voice telecomms, because it destroys the whole context that
made voice telecomms appear a natural monopoly. Less directly, but
by the same compelling economic logic, it vitiates the rationale
for government electromagnetic-spectrum allocation and all other
forms of "public-interest" media regulation.</p>

<p>Indeed, the advent of cheap Internet implies that
regulation-induced rigidities in the electromagnetic-spectrum
market will begin to seriously injure the consumer very soon, and
may already be doing so. Nicholas Negroponte (founder of the M.I.T
Media Lab) pointed out back in the 1980s that the association of
broadcast media with wireless transmission is a historical
accident. The success of cable TV demonstrates that in a world of
cheap wire, EM spectrum stops making sense as a broadcast or
long-haul medium. When costs of broadcast and long-distance
communications over the wire fall below some threshold, there's
more value in dedicating EM spectrum to short-haul mobile
communications (cell phones, PCS, and technologies like Metricom's
Ricochet system).</p>

<p>When we reach that crossover point (if we haven't already)
traditional electromagnetic-media firms won't be able to do the
economically rational thing, which would be to switch to cable and
Internet multicasting and sell their spectrum slots to
mobile-telecomms entrepreneurs. Because they're monopolies created
by spectrum and cable allocation for politically prescribed uses,
they will only be able to exploit spectrum by wasting it on
broadcast and long-haul. How many millions of man-hours and
billions of dollars in foregone opportunities are we going to lose
before we get the lobbyists and politicians out of the picture and
let the <em>market</em> solve this allocation problem?</p>

<p>More generally: in a world of ubiquitous Web pages, of a
thousand digital cable channels, of MUDs and MUCKs and MOOs, of
home-built virtual-reality simulations and every man his own
publisher and media conglomerate, who can sensibly argue that
access to a broadcast audience is an elite privilege demanding of
government scrutiny?</p>

<p>Communications will go where costs and regulatory barriers are
low. In a world of cheap wire, producers and consumers will simply
migrate where government-imposed restrictions (and their costs) are
not. Regulation cannot stop this; it can only impose unnecessary
costs and jeopardize our First Amendment rights while it tries.</p>

<p>Consider in this context the success of American call-relay
entrepreneurs in raiding megabucks of international voice business
away from rigid telecomms monopolies in Europe and elsewhere.
Consider also the way that the U.S. regulations on export of
cryptographic software have handed the international
secure-communications business to foreign corporations.</p>

<p>In the world of cheap Internet, the inefficiencies at the margin
created by telecomms regulation are no longer merely irritants,
they are economic suicide -- fruitless, bootless, and stupid.</p>

<h2>2. What rules can we get rid of and what rules should we write
to promote the development of the Internet?</h2>

<p>First, all the regulatory regimes and tariff rules that protect
old media and voice carriers from competition should be scrapped as
rapidly as procedurally may be. This will speed and ease the
transition to an Internet-centered telecommunications
infrastructure by discouraging further monetary and human
malinvestment in dead-end technologies and sunset industries.</p>

<p>Second, the government ought to respect the First Amendment as
it was written and intended ("Congress shall make <em>no law</em>
abridging freedom of speech...") and entirely recuse itself from
regulating the content of the Internet.</p>

<p>I have presented above reasons that soi-disant "public-interest"
regulation of older media creates market rigidities harmful to
consumers. Analogous reasoning would apply to the Internet, in
spades. Thankfully you already seem to realize this.</p>

<p>Write no rules. The public is being served magnificently well
without rules. Already our children and our advertising media toss
around URLs as casually as phone numbers -- and not just wealthy
children either. Everybody is getting into the act. Unlimited
Internet access is already down to $20 a month for most of the
U.S., less than the cost of an average restaurant dinner for two.
Internet cafes and library kiosks are spring up like mushrooms, and
so many of the homeless poor have email addresses that it's become
a running joke in several national newspaper comic strips.</p>

<p>In this regime, the only rule we need is "Laissez faire. Laissez
passer."</p>

<h2>3. Should we be concerned that the economics of pricing on
Internet -- influenced as they are by current out-of-date
regulatory policies -- won't in fact sustain development of the
Internet?</h2>

<p>Your question implies its own answer. All regulation has a
market-rigging side effect that raises prices on the regulated
good. When the regulatory policies you admit are out-of-date are
scrapped, costs will drop to their natural clearing level,
benefiting everybody.</p>

<p>But they won't drop below the point at which Internet
development is sustainable, because that's the same point at which
carriers large and small stop making a profit -- and carriers
aren't in business for their health.</p>

<p>Large Internet carriers like to grumble that the existing
settlement system is unfair, that they carry far more traffic for
the small ISPs and regionals than vice-versa. They agitate for
pricing by volume or by connection and advocate regressive, doomed
non-solutions like ATM. Some interpret these complaints to mean the
Net's growth is not sustainable -- but to do this, they ignore the
fact that these same complainers are still aggressively seeking
business, laying cable, and building infrastructure.</p>

<p>Evidently their real estimates of return-on-investment exceed
their rhetorical ones. The market is sustaining Internet
development very nicely -- and a freer market will do it better
still.</p>

<h2>4. How can we make sure that Internet reaches all Americans,
especially kids in classrooms?</h2>

<p>I'm not sure how universal schoolroom access will happen. But I
am certain that government intervention will slow, complicate, and
corrupt the process. And this is not mere theoretical
libertarianism on my part -- it is first-hand observation. I have
watched lavishly funded school-networking efforts run by government
in this county stumble and fail repeatedly, while CCIL did more
with a shoestring budget and a handful of volunteers. I know that
many other Internet activists nationwide have had parallel
experiences.</p>

<p>I am therefore adamantly opposed to proposals that an excise tax
be levied on phone bills to fund government-run educational
networking programs. That way lies only another huge, ineffective
federal bureaucracy and a raw deal for our kids.</p>

<p>We owe our children more than this. We owe them <em>lower</em>
taxes, less regulation, and the kind of abundant communications
infrastructure that only a vigorous free market and volunteer
efforts can create.</p>

<h2>5. How can we make sure the Internet reaches across the globe?
Don't we need government policy in the United States and worldwide
to guarantee that Internet access becomes a truly universal
product? Don't we need to guarantee that everyone gets access to
the common network of networks?</h2>

<p>The welfare of humanity as a whole is a noble goal. But the best
we in the U.S. can do for it is provide a good example by cleaning
up our own act. It's pretty arrogant of us to think we have the
power to do effective social engineering on other countries, or
even the right to try, given what we've wrought with government
intervention in our own.</p>

<p>I can certainly understand the desire of the public education
and social-welfare establishment to hitch its wagon to the Internet
star. But these are the same people who, operating from the very
noblest of intentions, have social-engineered our once-thriving
inner cities into drug-riddled free-fire zones and our once-proud
primary schools into an international disgrace. I fear the
possibility of being smothered by their toxic good intentions more
than I fear any other plausible future for the Internet; even
Supreme Court affirmation of the abominable Communications Decency
Act might frighten me less.</p>

<p>Nor am I alone. The general feeling among Internet technologists
(as opposed to pundits, politicians, and other professional
busybodies) is that the Internet is well on its way to meeting
universal-access goals now, and will do so naturally if the
would-be censors, the busybodies and the social engineers don't
step in and screw things up for everybody.</p>

<p>I've been in those trenches for years now, personally putting in
long hours to help the people least ready to adapt to the Internet
world. CCIL and hundreds of volunteer groups like it all over the
U.S. will do what the money-economy part of the market can't.
Between us, we'll solve the universal-access problem, if government
will stay out of the way.</p>

<p>And by "staying out of the way" we do not merely mean refraining
from hindering us. Well-intentioned but destructive "help" -- like
an excise tax for school networking funding hives of eager
bureaucrats, rent-seekers, and political drones -- would be worse
than hindrance. In my experienced opinion, and that of many of my
colleagues, no greater danger to universal cheap Internet access
could easily be imagined.</p>
