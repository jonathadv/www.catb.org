<p>Here is a sample response in a useful form:</p>

<pre><tt>
%%No-secrets 1.0:
Name:      Eric S. Raymond
Email:     esr@thyrsus.com
Version:   System V Release 1
When:      June 1986
Where:     Rabbit Software
Who:       co-worker
Public:    Yes
Affidavit: Yes
Have-Copy: Yes
%%
</tt></pre>

<p>If there are special circumstances you think I should know about, feel
free to include a text explanation afterwards.</p>

<p>Here is an explanation of the fields:</p>

<ol>
<li>Name: <em>Your full legal name.</em>  Reports under an alias or handle 
will be ignored.  </li>

<li>Email: <em>A valid return email address.</em>

<li>Version: <em>The OS name, version, and release.</em>

<li>When: <em>The date you gained access.</em>  Year is good; year and month
is better.</li>

<li>Where: <em>Where it happened.</em> You may omit this information if you
believe some person could be placed at legal risk by it.</li>

<li>Who: <em>Your relationship to the person who gave you access, or to the 
institution where you got it.</em> Were you a student, an employee, 
a colleague, a friend?  

<li>Public: <em>Whether you are willing to have your report be 
public.</em></p> 

<li>Affadavit: <em>Whether you are willing to sign an affidavit to the effect
that you had this access.</em></p> 

<li>Have-copy: <em>Do you still have access to a copy?</em>
</ol>

<p>You may think your story is too typical to need reporting, but
don't let that stop you.  I want to be able to show dozens, hundreds
or even <em>thousands</em> of examples of disclosure &mdash; a
pervasive and continuing pattern of failure to do what is required to
maintain trade secrecy under the law.  The privacy of individual
whistleblowers will be respected.</p>

<p>Please consider copying the above, changing the response to describe 
your access, and sending it back to me.  I expect to receive hundreds or
perhaps even thousands or responses; getting them in a form easy for 
analysis scripts to process would be a good thing.</p>

<p>Mail all responses to <a
href="mailto:esr+nosecrets@thyrsus.com">me</a>. Please use the subject
line "No secrets".</p>
