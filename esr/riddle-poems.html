<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Riddle-poems are a lot of fun. They're an amusing game for
children and adults, a connection to history, and a way to approach
poetry that avoids the conceit and self-indulgence that lays waste
to so much of it.</p>

<p>Anyone can appreciate riddle-poems, and almost anyone can learn
to make them. By doing so, you can enjoy yourself, sharpen your
wits, learn a new way to look at the world, and perhaps tap
resources of creativity you never suspected yourself to have.</p>

<p>With the riddle-poem comes the riddle-game. To play the
riddle-game, two or more people take turns making up riddles on the
spot. You win points, or jellybeans, or whatever, by answering
riddles correctly (we'll present some rules for a modern version of
the riddle-game later). If you're feeling uninspired, you can use a
riddle you've heard somewhere else, but doing that a lot is
considered poor form. The riddle-game should be about creativity,
not rote memory.</p>

<p>At this point, a lot of you are probably thinking <q>Improvise
poetry? I couldn't possibly! This isn't for me!</q> But you
<em>can</em> do it. One of the charms of the riddle-game is that it
proves that poetry need not be an elite art. I'll show you how to
make beautiful riddle-poems with simple methods that are play to
use, not hard specialized work.</p>

<p>We know of many cultures that have riddle-poem traditions. The
best-documented, and the one we'll be taking our model from, is the
riddle-poem tradition of the Anglo-Saxons, the Vikings, and the
Teutons. These peoples of the Dark Ages played the riddle-game
around their hearth-fires for more than five hundred years. Some of
their riddles have come down to us.</p>

<p>Here is a modern English translation of a simple riddle poem,
over a thousand years old. It's from a very old manuscript called
the Book of Exeter, which contains a treasury of Anglo-Saxon
riddles. It's one of my favorites.</p>

<pre>
  Riddle: A wonder on the wave / water became bone.

  Answer: Ice on a lake or seashore.
</pre>

<p>This simple one-line poem is an excellent example of the
riddle-poem style. Good riddle-poems are terse, pithy, visual,
rhythmic. Like haiku, they take their power from a compelling
image.</p>

<p>To appreciate this poem fully, speak it to yourself out loud
(the slash represents a caesura or pause). In the Dark Ages, poetry
was a spoken art. Poems were written to be chanted or sung.
Anglo-Saxon (the parent language of English) was a rolling,
sonorous, thunderous language well-suited to poetry and oration.
Some of this quality comes through even in translation.</p>

<h1>Basic Riddle-Poem Construction</h1>

<p>Here's an example of a riddle-poem in modern English in very
traditional style and subject:</p>

<pre>
  Riddle: A hoard of rings am I,
          but no fit gift for a bride;
          I await a sword's kiss.

  Answer: A suit of chain-mail.
</pre>

<p>Note that it doesn't rhyme. Rhyme is nice in a riddle-poem, but
strong rhythm (what poets call <q>good scansion</q>) is better.
Actually, traditional riddle-poems hardly employed rhyme for
structure at all; they used an elaborate set of stress rules and a
technique called <a href="#alliteration">alliteration</a> which
we'll describe later on.</p>

<p>Rhythm &mdash; speech rhythm &mdash; is all-important. In composing
riddle-poems that sound good, a bit of role-playing helps. When
you're working on one, try to imagine yourself chanting it to a
hall-full of drunken Vikings. Do they pound the tables and roar? Do
they laugh? Or do they just plain not get it?</p>

<p>Often you can get the right effect by sticking to muscular
one-and two-syllable words in your poem &mdash; avoid anything
Latin-sounding or elaborate. Sticking to concrete objects that
anyone in a medieval setting might have seen is also a good
idea.</p>

<p>That said, it's certainly possible to make riddles in the
traditional style about modern subjects. Consider these two
examples:</p>

<pre>
  Riddle: I am the black cloak of the road.

  Answer: Asphalt
</pre>

<p>Supposing your Viking had ever seen an asphalt road, he'd like
this one. Though he'd probably think it rather simple, a children's
riddle. Here's another good children's riddle, contributed by
Isobel Hooper:</p>

<pre>
  Riddle: Hard iron on horse / cow's hide on man.

  Answer: Shoe
</pre>

<p>Here's one with more meat:</p>

<pre>
  Riddle: I drink the blood of the Earth,
          and the trees fear my roar,
          yet a man may hold me in his hands.

  Answer: A chainsaw
</pre>

<p>The <q>blood of the Earth</q>, of course, is petroleum. This phrase
is a good example of what Viking poets called a <q>kenning</q>, a
poetic and indirect description of some simple thing or event &mdash; a
riddle within the riddle-poem.</p>

<p>Some Viking kennings were used so conventionally that they
became poetic cliches; for example, the ocean was called <q>the
whale-road</q>, the sun as <q>world-candle</q>, battle referred to as
<q>a feast of eagles</q>, warriors as <q>spear-trees</q> and generous
chieftains as <q>ring-givers</q> (it was considered a mark of special
favor for a Viking warrior to receive a ring or bracelet from the
chieftain's own arm, and such a gift also confirmed and raised the
status of the chieftain).</p>

<p>Other kennings were riddles in themselves, or ways of suggesting
that a thing could be viewed in two or more ways. The riddle-poem
above gets its power by suggesting some fearsome creature vast
enough to feed on the Earth itself, and then paradoxically stating
that the beast is small enough to be held in two hands.</p>

<p>Here is another, simpler riddle-poem with a similar hook:</p>

<pre>
  Riddle: Three eyes have I, all in a row;
          when the red one opens, all freeze.

  Answer: A traffic light.
</pre>

<p>Giving the subject of the riddle the qualities of a person, and
then having it describe itself poetically, is a very common style
of riddle. The stoplight riddle isn't a particularly inspired one,
though the first line makes neat use of the internal rhyme between
<q>eyes</q> and <q>I</q>.</p>

<p>Here are a few more of this kind to think about:</p>

<pre>
  Riddle: I am the hall-upholder,
          once crowned in green.

  Answer: Pillar carved from a tree-trunk.

  Riddle: I am the yellow hem
          of the sea's blue skirt.

  Answer: Sand on a beach.

  Riddle: I am the red tongue of the Earth,
          that buries cities.

  Answer: Lava from a volcano.

  Riddle: The Moon is my father,
          the Sea is my mother;
          I have a million brothers,
          I die when I reach land.

  Answer: A wave on the ocean.
</pre>

<p>Another common form is to make poetic assertions about the
subject that lead to an obvious image, which you then flatly deny,
creating an air of paradox. (We saw this above in the chain-mail
poem; <q>but no fit gift...</q>)</p>

<pre>
  Riddle: Thousands lay up gold within this house,
          but no man made it.
          Spears past counting guard this house,
          but no man wards it.

  Answer: A beehive.  The spears are bee stings.
</pre>

<h1>More Ancient Examples</h1>

<p>Here are some more riddles from the Book of Exeter. The
translations are based on Michael Alexander's <a id="alexander"
name="alexander"><cite>The Earliest English Poems</cite> (Penguin
1977; ISBN 0-14-044-172-7)</a>; I have tinkered with the first one
a bit to improve its scansion.</p>

<pre>
  <a id="beam">Riddle: I am fire-fretted / and I flirt with Wind;
          my limbs are light-freighted / I am lapped in flame.
          I am storm-stacked / and I strain to fly;
          I'm a grove leaf-bearing / and a glowing coal.</a>

Answer: A beam of wood.
</pre>

<p>Alexander gives a second verse for this one which I believe was
originally a separate riddle; the style is quite different.</p>

<pre>
  Riddle: From hand to hand / about the hall I go,
          Much do lords and ladies / love to kiss me;
          When I hold myself high / and the whole throng
          bows before me / their blessedness
          shall flourish skyward / beneath my fostering shade.

  Answer: A wooden god-image or crucifix.
</pre>

<p>Note that in the Book of Exeter no answers for the riddles are
given, and they are crowded onto the manuscript page without line
breaks. In some cases, the boundaries between riddles are not
clear.</p>

<pre>
  Riddle: Swings by his thigh / a thing most magical!
          Below the belt / beneath the folds
          Of his clothes it hangs / a hole in its front end,
          stiff-set and stout / it swivels about.

          Levelling the head / of this hanging tool, 
          its wielder hoists his hem / above his knee;
          it is his will to fill / a well-known hole
          that it fits fully / when at full length

          He's oft filled it before. / Now he fills it again.

  Answer: A key.
</pre>

<p>This sly little riddle distracts one with a sexual analogy, but
the key phrase "it swivels about" is a clue that the obvious answer
is not the right one.</p>

<h1>J.R.R. Tolkien's Riddle-Poems</h1>

<p>In <cite>The Hobbit</cite>, there is an important scene in which
Bilbo Baggins plays the riddle-game with Gollum in the orc passages
of the Misty Mountains. Tolkien was an expert on the language and
poetry of Anglo-Saxon; his riddles were clearly modeled on the
riddle-poems in the Book of Exeter. Here they are:</p>

<pre>
  Riddle: What has roots as nobody sees,
          Is taller than trees,
            Up, up it goes
            And yet never grows?

  Answer: A mountain.

  Riddle: Thirty white horses on a red hill,
            First they champ,
            Then they stamp,
          Then they stand still.

  Answer: Teeth in your mouth.

  Riddle: Voiceless it cries,
          Wingless flutters,
          Toothless bites,
          Mouthless mutters.

  Answer: The wind.

  Riddle: An eye in a blue face
          Saw an eye in a green face,
          "That eye is like to this eye"
          Said the first eye,
          "But in low place,
          Not in high place."

  Answer: Sun on a field of daisies.

  Riddle: It cannot be seen, cannot be felt
          Cannot be heard, cannot be smelt.
          It lies behind stars and under hills,
            And empty holes it fills.
          It comes first and follows after,
            Ends life, kills laughter.

  Answer: Darkness.

  Riddle: A box without hinges, key, or lid,
          Yet golden treasure inside is hid.

  Answer: An egg.

  Riddle: Alive without breath,
          As cold as death;
          Never thirsty, ever drinking,
          All in mail, never clinking.

  Answer: A fish.

  Riddle: No-legs lay on one-leg,
          Two-legs sat near on three-legs,
          four legs got some.

  Answer: Fish on a little table, man at table sitting on a stool,
          the cat ate the bones.

  Riddle: This thing all things devours:
          Birds, trees, beasts, flowers;
          Gnaws iron, bites steel;
          Grinds hard stones to meal;
          Slays king, ruins town,
          And beats high mountain down.

  Answer: Time.
</pre>

<p>Notice an interesting thing about these. Tolkien, the poet and
expert on Anglo-Saxon poetry, did not try to cast them in the
Anglo-Saxon meter! Instead, he uses the simple end-rhymed verse of
modern English folk poetry.</p>

<p>There are good reasons for this which we'll discuss further
below.</p>

<h1>A folk riddle from the Norse islands</h1>

<p>This is an old folk riddle from the Shetland and Faroe islands:

<pre>
  Riddle: Four hang, four walk,
          Four stand skyward,
          Two show the way to the field
          And one comes shaking behind 

  Answer: A cow. Four teats hang, four legs walk, two horns and two 
          ears stand skyward, two eyes show the way to the field and 
          one tail comes shaking (dangling) behind.
</pre>

<h1>Prosody, or How Not to Trip Over Your Feet</h1>

<p>The modern riddle-poem examples we give elsewhere in this
discussion generally have the feel of Anglo-Saxon and Viking verse,
but not its exact metrical style. Here you can learn a bit more
about the technical characteristics of both modern and Dark Ages
verse. This may help you fix riddle-poems that don't quite feel
right.</p>

<h2>Prosody in Modern English</h2>

<p>People who study prosody (the technical construction of poems)
have a whole set of terms for describing the <a id="meter"
name="meter">meter</a> of a poem &mdash; that is, its rules of rhyme and
rhythm.</p>

<p>The first important thing to know is that modern English meters
usually break up naturally into units called <dfn>feet</dfn>.</p>

<p>A foot is a two or three-beat combination of stressed and
unstressed syllables. There are four common kinds. In roughly
decreasing order of frequency, they are:</p>

<dl>
<dt><a id="iambic" name="iambic">iambic</a> (noun: iamb)</dt>

<dd>Unstressed syllable followed by stressed. Sample word:
"relax".</dd>

<dt>trochaic (noun: trochee)</dt>

<dd>Stressed followed by unstressed. Sample word: "nuthouse".</dd>

<dt>spondaic (noun: <a id="spondee"
name="spondee">spondee</a>)</dt>

<dd>Two stressed syllables. Sample word: "shortstop"</dd>

<dt>dactylic (noun: dactyl)</dt>

<dd>Stressed followed by two unstressed. Sample word:
"catalog"</dd>

<dt>anapestic (noun: anapest)</dt>

<dd>Two unstressed followed by a stressed.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Usually, a line of poetry in modern English is composed of a
minimum of two to a maximum of six repetitions of one kind of foot.
The number of feet per line is fixed and is an important feature of
the meter; this makes it a <a id="count" name="count"><dfn>counting
meter</dfn></a>.</p>

<p>The most common meter in English is "iambic pentameter", five
iambic feet per line. This is what Shakespeare wrote; it dominated
poetry in English from the mid-fourteenth to early twentieth
centuries. Here's a sample line:</p>

<pre>
  _   /     _    /     _    /     _   /     _    /
  So all | day long | the noise | of bat | tle roared
</pre>

<p>The vertical bars divide feet; / marks stressed syllables, _
unstressed ones (actually, prosodists use a crescent mark like a
breve rather than the underline).</p>

<p>Aside from the foot type and count, the most important
structural device in most modern English meters is <a id="endrhyme"
name="endrhyme"><dfn>end-rhyme</dfn></a> &mdash; pairs of sound-alike
words at the end of rhymes.</p>

<p>In a <a href="#count">counting meter</a> like iambic pentameter,
breaks and changes in the rhythm draw the hearer's or reader's
attention. Short or truncated lines create tension. A skilled poet
will use these devices to pace the poem and emphasize key phrases
and ideas.</p>

<h2>Dark Ages Prosody</h2>

<p>The riddle poems that come down to us are written in the oldest,
classic form of Germanic verse; "<a id="longmeter"
name="longmeter">long-meter</a>". This <a href="#meter">meter</a>
doesn't have a fixed number or style of feet; instead, it consists of
half-lines, separated by a <a id="caesura" name="caesura">caesura</a>
or strong pause, each containing two stressed syllables. The first
three stresses should share the same initial sound (this is called <a
id="alliteration"
name="alliteration"><dfn>alliteration</dfn></a>).</p>

<p>The translation of the <a href="#beam">beam-of-wood riddle</a>
given above is a particularly fine example of <a
href="#longmeter">long-meter</a> in modern English. Like the oldest
and strictest Viking verse, it holds the number of unstressed
syllables per line to a minimum. The last line is technically
imperfect, having only two alliterations and those weak ones (gr-
with gl-), but the Dark Ages bards themselves not infrequently
dropped a stitch in the same way. Nevertheless, the rhythm and feel of the
piece are true to the Dark Ages form.</p>

<p>Getting pure <a href="#longmeter">long-meter</a> this thoroughly
right in modern English is hard, though; the sound-pattern of
English has changed, becoming more like that of the Latin, French
and Greek languages for which end-rhymed counting verse works well.
And the results tend to sound awkward to modern ears, used as they
are to <a href="#endrhyme">end-rhyme</a> and <a
href="#count">counting meters</a>.</p>

<h1>Getting the Right Sound</h1>

<p>It works better to blend some features of <a
href="#longmeter">long-meter</a> into modern forms. Rudyard Kipling's
<a href='http://www.kipling.org.uk/poems_harp.htm'>Harp-Song of the
Dane Women</a> shows what a really able poet can do along these lines:</p>

<pre>
   /   /   _    / _      _      /   _       /   _
  Ah, What is | woman || that | you for- | sake her?
   _   _      /   /       _   _   /    / _
  And the hearth-fire || and the home-acre?
   _  /  _    _   /   _    / _   / _
  To go with the old gray Widow-Maker?
</pre>

<p>(In this notation, || indicates the half-line pause.) None of
these lines is perfect <a href="#longmeter">long-meter</a>; the
first has only two <a href="#alliteration">alliterations</a>, the
two <a href="#spondee">spondees</a> in the second line don't fit
any of the historical half-line stress patterns (see Appendix C of
the <a href="#alexander">Alexander book</a> for details), and the
third line lacks a <a id="#caesura" name="#caesura">caesura</a>.
Finally, the lines are <a href="#endrhyme">end rhymed</a>, a
practice rare in long-meter.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it works. It has the kind of somber power one can
sense in translations of Dark Ages poetry. Your best riddles can
sound like this, and that's a worthy goal.</p>

<p>Here's another example that's an actual riddle:</p>

<pre>
Riddle: Screaming, soaring / seeking sky
        Flowers of fire / flying high
        Eastern art / from ancient time
        Name me now / and solve this rhyme

Answer: Fireworks.
</pre>

<p>Observe that this uses both <a
href="#alliteration">alliterations</a> and <a href="#endrhyme">end
rhyme</a>. The third line illustrates how in <a
href="#longmeter">long-meter</a> all initial vowels were considered
equivalent for alliterative purposes. The first line is technically
imperfect, as the last stressed syllable should not alliterate.</p>

<p>Here's another one for you to analyze yourself:</p>

<pre>
Riddle: My step is slow / the snow's my breath
        I give the ground / a grinding death
        My marching / makes an end of me
        Slain by sun / or drowned in sea.

Answer: A glacier.
</pre>

<h1>How to Make a Riddle-Poem</h1>

<p>Work backwards. First, pick your answer. Then, imagine it
speaking to you; describing itself, telling you what it does. Then
make that into a little poem.</p>

<p>As I was thinking about the last paragraph, my eyes lit on the
telephone beside my keyboard. I decided to make a riddle-poem for
which <q>telephone</q> is the answer.</p>

<p>So I imagine the phone speaking to me. It says <q>I carry the
voices of people over many miles</q>. That's a good start, but it's
not specific enough; it could apply to a radio as well.</p>

<p>What distinguishes a phone from a radio? Wires. But if I mention
wires directly, the riddle will be too obvious. So I think instead
about what a phone looks like, analogizing it to a body. And I have
it:</p>

<pre>
  Riddle: One ear, one mouth, no legs,
          But I will carry your voice a thousand miles.
</pre>

<p>This is pretty nice. But the scansion in the second line is not
quite right.</p>

<pre>
    _  /  _    /  _   _    /   _   /  _    /
   But I will carry your voice a thousand miles.
</pre>

<p>This is close to iambic pentameter. It could be improved by a
one-syllable verb replacement for <q>carry</q>. There are lots of
possibilities; <q>take</q>, <q>waft</q>, <q>send</q>, <q>bear</q>. I like
<q>bear</q> for its archaic sound. And so we have it:</p>

<pre>
    /   /       /    /        /   /
   One ear, || one mouth, || no legs,
    _  /     _    /        _    /      _   /        _    /
   But I || will bear || your voice || a thou- || sand miles.
</pre>

<p>This is an easy riddle, but the construction worked well. In
general, these are the steps you'll usually go through:</p>

<ol>
<li>Pick a subject.</li>

<li>Imagine the subject speaking to you.</li>

<li>If that doesn't work, analogize the subject to a body or
creature.</li>

<li>Adjust the description to the level of difficulty you
want.</li>

<li>For best poetic effect, fix the scansion in the result.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Rules for the Riddle-Game</h1>

<p>The riddle-game, played between two or more people, is a simple
contest of poetry and wit. In the two-person version, players take
turns posing each other riddles; each time, the answerer guesses
and the riddler either agrees that the answer is correct or reveals
the correct answer.</p>

<p>Each time a player fails to guess a riddle correctly, the
riddler scores a point. In multi-player games, permit each player
other than the riddler to guess; riddler gets one point for each
wrong answer, but no points if no-one guesses correctly.</p>

<p>To prevent the tactic of simply posing vague or nonsensical
riddles (especially in the two-player game), it is helpful to have
a vocal audience. The audience gets to disallow a score, and dock
the riddler a point, if they judge his/her riddle is badly
made.</p>

<p>Also, players may award "style points" to each other, or the
audience to either. A style point is due if the answerer thinks of
an answer which is not what the riddler intended, but works just as
well or better; or, from the audience, for any unusually poetic,
tricky, or beautiful riddle.</p>

<p>The riddle-game works best if the players think of it not as
cut-throat competition but as a performance art, like a jam session
with words.</p>

#1 from Guy Steele &lt;gls@east.sun.com&gt;, 26 Jun 1995:

<a id="riddle1"
name="riddle1">Riddle:</a> A slow, solemn square-dance
        Of warriors feinting.
        One by one they fall,

        Early morning flight,
        Silently it flies,
        Slowly in the skies.
        Hides before the night.

<h1>Other Riddle-Poem Resources</h1>

<p>Other cultures have riddle-poem traditions that are less well
preserved than the Scandinavian one, or at least less translated
into English. I have found one page of <a
href="http://www.lfcc.lt/publ/roots/node19.html">Lithuanian</a>
riddles, for example.</p>

<p>The Contrapuntal Platypus has a <a
href="http://contrapuntalplatypus.wordpress.com/a-treasury-of-riddle-poems/">Treasury of Riddles</a> page, in a style similar to that described here.</p>

<p>Sherri Johnson has a <a
href="http://www.enigmagraphics.com/riddles/index.htm">Riddles</a>
page with many tasty (and difficult) examples of the riddle poem
from different cultures.</p>
