<h1 class="c1">SF Words and Prototype Worlds</h1>

<p>One of the central features of SF after John W. Campbell's
reinvention of the field in the late 1930s has been an expository
style in which, rather than being directly told the important
features of a fictional world, the reader is encouraged to
half-consciously deduce them from clues dropped by the writer.
Thus, for example, a writer who wishes to establish that most
people are telepaths in his future might make his viewpoint
character's first line "What would it be like to wake up in the
morning and be unable to read minds?". Or (to cite a well-known
example due to Samuel Delany) a writer wishing the reader to
imagine with him a future of intense space industrialization might
throw in a casual reference to "the monopole mines in the asteroid
belt".</p>

<p>Reading SF is, accordingly, a learned skill of some complexity.
First, one has to learn to actually <em>see</em> sentences like
"What would it be like to wake up in the morning and be unable to
read minds?" rather than editing "unable" into "able" and missing
the point. Then, one has to develop at least casual, imagistic
knowledge about things like the asteroid belt and magnetic
monopoles, in order to be able to interpret "the monopole mines in
the asteroid belt" as something more meaningful than (as Delany
puts it) a gaudy purple word-noise.</p>

<p>It is thus clear that the process of reading SF involves merging
the stream of prose presented by the writer with a rather large
amount of special context. To some extent, of course, this is true
of any genre of fiction or art not set in the reader's everyday
world -- readers of Westerns (for example) need to know what a
Peacemaker is, and why a vaquero might throw a lariat, and what he
throws it at. But the context an SF reader (and writer) needs is
unusual in some important respects.</p>

<p>First, there's a lot more of it. To fully decode "the monopole
mines in the asteroid belt" it's not sufficient merely to know what
the asteroid belt is and what a monopole is (a theoretically
possible but not yet observed particle with an isolated "north
pole" or "south pole" charge). You need to have a fair idea why
people might want them enough to mine them (for use in tiny but
very powerful motors, as it happens). You need to know something
about the history and economics of extractive industries in
frontier areas, enough to predict that Belt miners are going to be
a pretty rough-necked crowd to be playing around with all that
space technology, and that there's likely to be something not
totally unlike the wild and wooly Nevada mining camps of the late
nineteenth century going on out there among the flying
mountains.</p>

<p>Second, a lot of that context is about <em>things that don't
exist yet</em>. A novice reader of Westerns has a fair chance of
having enough knowledge about the American West to read a Louis
L'Amour novel without tripping over unknown concepts. The American
West existed -- perhaps not as dramatically and mythically
portrayed, but it existed. There's lots of implicit and explicit
knowledge about it floating around in the general culture. You can
go into any hat store and buy at least a reasonable imitation of a
ten-gallon hat.</p>

<p>A reader of post-Campbellian SF has none of these advantages.
It's not sufficient to understand a single history; one needs to
have a working grasp of a large number of possible futures -- to be
able to draw inferences from the text of an SF work that are
roughly parallel to the author's intended ones, even though both
author and reader are imagining a world that has never existed!</p>

<p>So stated, the task before writer and reader seems well-nigh
impossible. And yet, SF writers do successfully communicate with
their readers (if perhaps <em>only</em> with their readers...). And
experienced SF readers show every sign of being able typically to
synchronize with a writer's world vision without even mental effort
significant enough to be noticeable. How can this be?</p>

<p>The answer, almost never stated as such but implicitly
understood by all SF fans, is that the SF genre over the last fifty
years has evolved a sophisticated code of shared signifiers for
describing counterfactual worlds. The gravamen of this essay is
that these signifiers (the jargon of SF) function not merely as a
set of isolated signs but as descriptions of a stock set of
<i>prototype worlds</i> which they logically and conventionally
imply, and which permit writers to specify mainly what (if
anything) is <em>unique</em> about their world vision rather than
what is shared with the rest of SF.</p>

<p>Critics unfamiliar with the field (and even some familiar with
it) frequently miss this point. To see why, we need to take a look
at the different ways a reader or critic may respond to SF
jargon.</p>

<p>In looking at an SF-jargon term like, say, "groundcar", or "warp
drive" there is a spectrum of increasingly sophisticated possible
decodings. The most naive is to see a meaningless, uninterpretable
wordlike noise and stop there.</p>

<p>The next level up is to recognize that uttering the word
"groundcar" or "warp drive" actually signifies something that's
important for the story, but to lack the experience to know what
that is. The motivated beginning reader of SF is in this position;
he must, accordingly, consciously puzzle out the meaning of the
term from the context provided by the individual work in which it
appears.</p>

<p>The third level is to recognize that "ground car" and "warp
drive" are signifiers shared, with a consistent and known meaning,
by <em>many</em> works of SF -- but to treat them as isolated
stereotypical signs, devoid of meaning save inasmuch as they permit
the writer to ratchet forward the plot without requiring
imaginative effort from the reader.</p>

<p>Viewed this way, these signs emphasize those respects in which
the work in which they appear is merely derivative from previous
works in the genre. Many critics (whether through laziness or
malice) stop here. As a result they write off all SF, for all its
pretensions to imaginative vigor, as a tired jumble of shopworn
cliches.</p>

<p>The fourth level, typical of a moderately experienced SF reader,
is to recognize that these signifiers function by permitting the
writer to quickly establish shared imaginative territory with the
reader, so that both parties can concentrate <em>on what is unique
about their communication</em> without having to generate or
process huge expository lumps. Thus these "stereotypes" actually
operate in an anti-stereotypical way -- they permit both writer and
reader to focus on <em>novelty</em>.</p>

<p>At this level the reader begins to develop quite analytical
habits of reading; to become accustomed to searching the writer's
terminology for what is implied (by reference to previous works
using the same signifiers) and what kinds of exceptions and
novelties convey information about the world and the likely plot
twists.</p>

<p>It is at this level, for example, that the reader learns to rely
on "groundcar" as a tip-off that the normal transport mode in the
writer's world is by personal flyer. At this level, also, the
reader begins to analytically compare the author's description of
his world with other SFnal worlds featuring personal flyers, and to
recognize that different kinds of flyers have very different
implications for the rest of the world.</p>

<p>For example, the moderately experienced reader will know that
worlds in which the personal fliers use wings or helicopter-like
rotors are probably slightly less advanced in other technological
ways than worlds in which they use ducted fans -- and <em>way</em>
behind any world in which the flyers use antigravity! Once he sees
"groundcar" he will be watching for these clues.</p>

<p>The very experienced SF reader, at the fifth level, can see
entire worlds in a grain of jargon. When he sees "groundcar" he
associates to not only technical questions about flyer propulsion
but socio-symbolic ones but about why the culture still uses
groundcars at all (and he has a reportoire of possible answers
ready to check against the author's reporting). He is automatically
aware of a huge range of consequences in areas as apparently far
afield as (to name two at random) the architectural style of
private buildings, and the ecological consequences of accelerated
exploitation of wilderness areas not readily accessible by ground
transport.</p>

<p>The better an SF writer is, the more subtly and effectively he
will play off against the experienced reader's analytical skills.
At the highest levels, SFnal exposition takes on the nature of a
delicate, powerful intellectual dance or game between writer and
reader, requiring much from both and rewarding both very
richly.</p>

<p>Indeed, to true aficionados of the genre this game is the whole
point of SF, the unique quality which elevates it above other
fictional forms. This attitude explains much about the genre that
outsiders find obscure and annoying -- the intimacy between fans
and writers; the indifference or outright hostility to conventional
"literary values"; the pervasive SF-fan complaint that outsiders
"just don't get it" and (when they deign to approve of SF at all)
like all the wrong books for all the wrong reasons.</p>

<p>It is not, however, the purpose of this essay to issue a general
apologia for SF and the attitudes of its fans. Rather, we are
concerned here with the rules of the game -- the ways in which the
shared context which makes SF intelligible evolved, is represented
in the minds of writers and readers, and is communicated to new
readers and writers.</p>

<p>SF readers and writers have only finite memory and processing
time to spend on the genre. Therefore they can have only a finite
set of templates or archetypes to use as references in the game of
communicating constructed worlds with each other. How (one may
reasonably ask) can one particular finite set of prototypes have
become established as the references that hold the genre
together?</p>

<p>The set of possible prototypes is, first, strongly constrained
by the way the universe works. No SF fan would, for example,
believe without a lot of explicit convincing argument in a culture
that uses both laser cannons and stone-throwing catapults as war
weapons. Techno-logic says this doesn't happen, and the central
constraint of the SF game is that the author gets only a very
limited number of implausible premises before the suspension bridge
of disbelief collapses.</p>

<p>To the extent we understand a "logic" in history and social
structures, that constrains prototype worlds as well. A writer can
erect a Galactic Emperor, or can describe by implication a
relatively un-coercive interstellar society with secure property
rights, unrestricted travel, a free press, etc; but if they're both
going to be in the same world at the same time, the Emperor had
better be a consitutional monarch rather than a bloody-handed
despot casually shipping people off to the thorium mines.</p>

<p>At this point we must explicitly admit that to speak of
prototype <em>worlds</em> is a bit of an oversimplification.
Prototype worlds do exist (and there are reasons we'll discuss in a
bit to cast the discussion in terms of them) but there are many
possible-world templates of less than whole-world size. An
excellent example, taking off from the previous discussion of
"groundcar", is the template for "flitter technology", which we can
express partly as the following series of statements and
implications:</p>

<ul>
<li>Flitters have roughly the speed and altitude limits of a light
plane but are capable of vertical or very-short-field
operation.</li>

<li>Flitters have about the cost range of a present-day
automobile.</li>

<li>Flitters effectively never fall out of the sky. (Otherwise they
would be deemed too dangerous for widespread personal use.)</li>

<li>For the previous statement to be true, flitters probably use
some unknown form of no-moving-parts antigravity technology or
reactionless drive. Be unsurprised if the world features other
possible applications of exotic physics and force field technology,
such as force shields, exotic energy weapons, and a
faster-than-light drive</li>

<li>If ground transport is still used at all, either the reasons
are ceremonial and sentimental (as with horse transport today) or
something about flitter technology makes it uneconomic for long
hauls of large payloads.</li>

<li>Roads no longer exist, except possibly as isolated museum
pieces for groundcar fanciers.</li>

<li>Urban architecture is no longer structured by a street grid;
expect lots of parks and pedestrian malls instead.</li>

<li>There is virtually no habitable untouched wilderness left on
Earth.</li>

<li>Sub-planetary governments probably no longer exist. If they do,
they somehow manage it despite being effectively unable to control
cross-border transit.</li>

<li>And more...</li>
</ul>

<p>Notice that this prototype has both a defining logical
consistency and hooks to other prototypes -- for example, the
fourth item implies the existence of a "force field" or "exotic
physics" template that groups together antigravity, energy weapons,
and a faster-than-light drive.</p>

<p>When enough of these prototypes hook together, one has a
prototype world. And this is in fact often what happens in an SF
reader's head as he comprehends the clues a writer has scattered
about in a work of SF. But previous discussion has centered on the
idea of a prototype world because those, too are entities
recognized by readers -- and, in fact, every prototype of less than
whole-world size started out life as <em>a fragment of a prototype
world</em>!</p>

<p>Thus, for example, one of the prototype dystopias in SF looks
like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>The society is rigidly stratified along birth-caste lines.</li>

<li>Birth castes are produced by technological manipulation in
creches.</li>

<li>Either caste is obvious from physical appearance, or people
wear uniform-like clothes which display their caste
affiliation.</li>

<li>Having a child outside the creche system is highly
illegal.</li>

<li>Conformity is maintained by inculcation of a a religious or
quasi-religious ideology in which the mythic founders of the
society play a central role, with an effective secret police as
backstop.</li>
</ul>

<p>This prototype dystopia may be set on a starship, in a hivelike
fortress-city, or on an ecologically devastated future Earth. The
background technology may be nearly that of present-time Earth or
include interstellar travel and nanotechnology. Nevertheless, it's
hard for anyone who has read the original to miss that this
prototype is essentially a fragment of Aldous Huxley's <cite>Brave
New World</cite> (1934) running around loose.</p>

<p>In some cases (like this one), most SF fans can instantly name
the source story of a prototype world or fragment in some seminal
work of the genre. Indeed, perhaps the best single-sentence
definition of a seminal work in SF would be this: <cite>one that
originated a still-recognized template world</cite> or major
fragment.</p>

<p>In other cases, the prototype world becomes sufficiently
detached from its original source(s) that they are no longer
readily identifiable. For example, here is a prototype world that
has been extremely widespread in SF since at least the early 1950s.
One might call it the "Galactic Federation" template:</p>

<ul>
<li>Earth humanity has faster-than-light interstellar travel and
has spread to dozens or hundreds of extra-solar planets (transit
times on the order of weeks).</li>

<li>Key technologies include FTL, personal flyers, and energy
weapons; may include forcefields; do <em>not</em> generally include
advanced biological manipulation, matter transmission, or
nanotechnology (or there may be taboos that prevent application of
these to humans).</li>

<li>Human space is dominated by a single political unit with a
democratic federal structure, with individual planetary governments
sending representatives to a galactic senate.</li>

<li>The federation government has a military monopoly. but lacks
either the capability or authority (or both) to routinely interfere
in events below planetary level.</li>

<li>Planetary law varies, but most worlds share a common legal
framework including property rights, freedom of speech and
assembly, and unrestricted travel.</li>

<li>The older worlds, closer to Earth (the "core" or "core worlds")
are wealthy, heavily urbanized, and (for story purposes)
boring.</li>

<li>The frontier (the "fringe") is a rough, challenging environment
(most stories are set there). New worlds are constantly being
scouted and opened to colonization. There is usually a specialist
service of the federation government, quasi-military in structure
but distinct from the military, dedicated to exploring new
worlds.</li>

<li>The economic structure is a relatively laissez-faire
capitalism. In the core regions, planetary governments are more
powerful than corporations. On the fringe the reverse is
occasionally true.</li>

<li>The federation may be in occasional or regular contact with
nonhuman aliens beyond its frontiers. If so, relations are
generally peaceful (otherwise the federation's political structure
would become more centralized and militarized than in the standard
prototype) though there may be tension, occasional minor flare-ups
and may have been a significant war within historical memory.</li>

<li>And more...</li>
</ul>

<p>All these implications are present, to an experienced SF reader,
the instant a writer says "the Federation" or anything recognizably
similar. Among other instances, this is the prototype of the Star
Trek universe's "United Federation of Planets".</p>

<p>From E.E. "Doc" Smith's space operas in the 1930s through
William Gibson's original cyberpunk novels in the early 1980s, the
most important works in SF have been those that created or
solidified new prototype worlds -- and with them, new jargon, new
signifiers that eventually became signatures of the prototypes as
they drifted free of their sources to be used and transformed and
re-worked in new works of SFnal imagination.</p>

<p>This is why the shared jargon of SF is so important to
understanding the field as a whole. It maps in miniature the
structure of the prototype worlds that readers and writers hold in
common.</p>
