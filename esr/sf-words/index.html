<h1 class="c1">Prototype Worlds: A Glossary of SF Jargon</h1>

<p>This is a glossary of SF coinages, collected for the enjoyment
and education of SF fans, SF writers, lexicographers, and
linguists.</p>

<p>Most of this glossary is words originally coined in science
fiction to describe technologies that did not exist at the time of
writing or SFnal ideas for which no obviously suitable mainstream
term was handy (some of these have since become mainstream). Some
words coined elsewhere but now used almost exclusively in SF (e.g.
<i>cyborg</i>, <i>ornithopter</i>) are included.</p>

<p>The intent is to capture terms which are general to SF, not
terms specific to one single imagined world. SF writers use, and
experienced SF readers learn, a vocabulary that crosses multiple
fictional worlds. This vocabulary of conventional terms conveys
important information about the kind of world the author has
imagined, and that world's relationship to the archetypes and
tropes of SF.</p>

<p>Some terms used by SF fans in discussing SF, but not used in SF
itself, are included. These are tagged "Critical term".</p>

<p>Contributions and corrections are invited; send them to <a
href="mailto:esr@thyrsus.com">esr@snark.thyrsus.com</a>. Where an
entry says "[first use unknown]" this is specific invitation to
send information on the earliest usage you know about.</p>

which describes the experience and knowledge-base from which these
reviews were written).</p>
