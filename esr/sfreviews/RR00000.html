<p>Don't be fooled by the Baen Fantasy imprint or the gorgeous
cover -- <cite>The Cage</cite> is not fantasy but a gritty, bloody,
realistic work of post-holocaust SF. This is a book that will grab
you by the viscera and not let go.</p>

<p>As it opens, we meet Megan Whitlock and her companion/lover
Shkai'ra in the act of reclaiming the southernmost branch of the
river trading house that was once hers. It develops that she had
been drugged, raped and sold into slavery halfway across the world
by her former lieutenant Habiku and has made her way back through
many an adventure, burning with the need for revenge.</p>

<p>It is no accident that the novel begins long after her escape
and after the better part of her journey home. For, although this
book has a fully satisfying measure of adventure and derring-do, it
isn't about adventure -- it's about domination and revenge and the
the twisted, intimate relationships that can grow between those who
become entangled in both.</p>

<p>Megan and Shkai'ra must fight and trick their way upriver
against everything Habiku can send at them. As they do, we get a
vivid montage of a complex of vital societies four thousand years
after a nuclear spasm. The basic tech level is about 16th-century
but with some odd differences -- they make fiberglass and have at
least some medical skills beyond the present day's, but don't use
gun- powder. There is some `magic' in the world, but it's obviously
a fairly weak sort of psionics rather than the baroque occultistic
magic of most fantasy.</p>

<p>As the plot thickens we get a good look at two strong
protagonists and a thoroughly nasty but very human and
three-dimensional villain. Stirling's previous work (<cite>Marching
Through Georgia</cite>, <cite>Under The Yoke</cite>) has displayed
a dark fascination with the psychosexual dynamics of slavery -- the
way in which identification with the oppressor can turn into an
unholy parody of love. That theme is here too, and as in those
books it's handled in a clear-eyed way that never loses sight of
the essential evil in such transactions (this book is definitely
not S&amp;M porn or anything like a Gor pastiche).</p>

<p>Some readers may find the authors' depiction of the loving
relationship between Megan and Shkai'ra abhorrent. Others may read
a shrill, anti-male agenda into it. Both reactions would miss the
point, which is that in the novel's world gender makes very little
social difference and casual bisexuality is quite the accepted
norm. The novel would change very little if one or both were male
-- the essential point is that they love and trust one another. And
what distinguishes Megan from Habiku, in the end, is that she knows
how to love and learns to free herself from the bonds of
hatred.</p>

<p>Blessedly, there is nothing cheap or gooey or sentimental about
this discovery in <cite>The Cage</cite>, no starry-eyed pieties
about love conquering all and dissolving antagonisms into a rosy
haze of good feeling. Redemption, when it comes, is earned as much
by blood and toil and courage and an unflinching willingness to see
evil for what it is as by love.</p>

<p>Stirling and Maier deserve praise for having written a novel
that works as an intense psychological study without sacrificing
any of the action, color, and other virtues of the "pulp fiction"
tradition. Happily, there's been a rash of this lately (I think of
Lois McMaster Bujold's "Miles Vorkosigan" stories, in particular)
but one can find examples as far back as Alfred Bester's <cite>The
Stars My Destination</cite>). <cite>The Cage</cite> is strong stuff
-- and strongly recommended.</p>
