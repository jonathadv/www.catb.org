<p>I'll admit it up front -- I'm a Heinleinophile, and that's why
this book is the subject of RR#1. By anyone's measure Robert Anson
Heinlein was one of the giants of SF, exerting a formative
influence on the field second only to that of his mentor John W.
Campbell.</p>

<p>For any Heinlein fan, or anyone interested in the history of SF,
this book is a must. Fans will perhaps find the most interest in
the material cut from the originals of <cite>Red Planet</cite> and
<cite>Podkayne Of Mars</cite>, reproduced here. Numerous letters
shedding light on the development of Heinlein's novels (especially
<cite>Stranger In A Strange Land</cite> and the later juveniles)
are included. There are even pictures of Heinlein as a young child,
graduating high school, and as a Navy cadet.</p>

<p>Historians may find equal interest in Heinlein's business
correspondence. These letters add up to an interesting portrait of
the life and working conditions of a leading professional writer in
the period 1940-1960. It takes one aback to learn how thoroughly
some of Heinlein's work was censored and messed over during his
`juveniles' period -- we discover that one editor even considered
the "flat cats" in <cite>The Rolling Stones</cite> to be luridly
sexual and wanted them excised!</p>

<p>I must report, however, that some of what's included strikes me
as filler. There's altogether too much on housebuilding and
gardening that doesn't seem to have much relevance to Heinlein's
works or personality. And the sidebars synopsizing Heinlein's
novels are jarringly bad, apparently written by a non- fan at about
the reading level of a dull 9-year-old.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that you will have to sift through a fair
amount of pedestrian setting to find the pearls -- but pearls there
are in plenty and they more than justify the price of the book. In
one letter discussing cuts in <cite>Red Planet</cite>, for example,
we find a stirring libertarian defense of personal weapon ownership
that lays any lingering doubts about Heinlein's political
philosophy to rest (and probably ought to be required reading for
every U.S. legislator!).</p>

<p>Heinlein's legacy to the SF field has been immense, his impact
on the lives of his readers more so. <cite>Grumbles From The
Grave</cite> is dedicated to "Heinlein's Children". Some might find
that puzzling, as he never had biological offspring -- but we know
who we are. That cantankerous, profound old man from Missouri was a
second father to hundreds of thousands of bright kids in this
century. Perhaps the best news <cite>Grumbles</cite> has brought us
is that that voice is not yet quite stilled.</p>

<p>Hints and references in the book suggest that there will be more
to come from Heinlein's papers. Uncut versions of several novels
are in preparation, including a 50%-longer version of
<cite>Stranger</cite> and an edition of <cite>The Moon Is A Harsh
Mistress</cite> with substantial additions. There could be no more
fitting tribute to Heinlein's memory than to finally let his
unexpurgated work speak for itself; and we can hope that
<cite>Grumbles</cite> will be but the first piece of a truer
portrait of Heinlein than existed in his lifetime.</p>
