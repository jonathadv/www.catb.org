<p>(Note: this novel is nearly two years old now and thus falls
outside what I usually consider `current' -- but I am going to talk
it up here anyhow because it's just been reissued, the author is a
relative unknown, and it's so <em>good</em>)</p>

<p>One of modern SF's most persistent tropes, it seems, is the idea
of the starpilot-as-magus. The field is full of stories in which
pilots are wild talents cyborged or biologically enhanced into some
kind of mystical union with their ships, or into an ESP-like
perception of a gorgeous and complex otherspace. Frank Herbert's
Guildsmen, Vonda McIntyre's heartless Aztecs, the pilot/alchemists
of Melissa Scott's Silence Leigh trilogy, Gerard Conway's
<cite>Mindship</cite>, Jeffrey Carver's <cite>Starrigger's
Way</cite>...one could cite many other examples, perhaps beginning
with Cordwainer Smith's epochal stories <cite>Scanners Live In
Vain</cite>, <cite>Drunkboat</cite>, and <cite>The Game of Rat And
Dragon</cite>.</p>

<p>The starpilot-as-magus may be the perfect mythic figure for a
technological age -- the special individual who, alone, can focus
and realize the potentials of technology by achieving ecstatic
union with it. It is no accident that the experience of the
starpilot is often portrayed in these stories as partaking of an
unmatchable, orgasmic intensity; in this way, the author can merge
human hungers for transcendence and catharsis with new,
science-created themes of starflight and technological triumph. In
these stories, the pilot is truly deus ex machina -- a god come out
of the machine.</p>

<p>In David Zindell's first novel, <cite>Neverness</cite>, he
develops this idea with such power, intricacy and brilliance that
all the previous treatments are simply eclipsed. Though the novel
has other vast themes and gives us a look at several bizarre and
original cultures and a cast of remarkable characters, its heart is
in the piloting sequences and its portrait of the Order of Mystic
Mathematicians.</p>

<p>I won't try to summarize the plot here; a bare-bones synopsis
could not possibly do it justice. Several of the philosophical
ideas woven into the plot deserve essays all by themselves. The
inventiveness of this book is extravagant; some of the things
Zindell tosses off as throwaway lines would have been milked for
entire novels by lesser writers. It has epic sweep; it has sense of
wonder by the ton load; it has high tragedy and joy and horror and
sex and violence and a few moments of low comedy.</p>

<p>Indeed, if this novel has a fault it's that it's <em>too</em>
brilliant. It reminds me in this way of John Varley's short
stories, from which I learned that having one's mind blown every
several pages can be quite fatiguing! And you may not (in fact,
almost certainly will not) agree with all the ethical premises of
the novel's Civilized Worlds.</p>

<p>No matter. This book earns an official Raymond's Review Rave;
buy it, read it, give it to your friends, talk David Zindell
up...do <em>anything</em> to keep the man writing! If he can
consistantly compose at the level of quality represented by
<cite>Neverness</cite>, I think he is guaranteed a place among the
giants of SF.</p>
