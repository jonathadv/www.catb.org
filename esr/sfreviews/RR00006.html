<p>I wanted to like this book. I really did, because I'm a
libertarian and the author is a libertarian propagandist.
Unfortunately, it suffers all too obviously to me from having been
written as propaganda first and novel second. You might find it
stimulating if you know little about libertarian philosophy (quick
test: if someone says `libertarian' and you think any of
`conservative' `Lyndon LaRouche' or `let us kill and eat the poor',
you are sufficiently ignorant to learn from this book).</p>

<p>L. Neil Smith has been a promising writer for a long time now.
His first novel, <cite>The Probability Broach</cite>, was pretty
good. But most of the incredible clutter of sequels that followed
it were forgettable, and he's spent too much time for his artistic
good turning out renumerative hack-work like the Lando Calrissian
books.</p>

<p>On the other hand, he's always had a fertile and quirky
imagination; books like <cite>Their Majesty's Bucketeers</cite>,
<cite>Wardove</cite> and <cite>The Crystal Empire</cite> confirmed
that he could write a pretty good stick when not preoccupied with
beating the drum for his politics.</p>

<p>On the third hand, he's also displayed a regrettable tendency
towards mellerdrammer -- in particular, making his villains
implausibly blacker-than-black in a way that actually tends to
drown out the valid ethical points he has to make.</p>

<p>I keep buying his novels, hoping he'll learn to curb his
excesses and develop the mature novelistic skill to match his
persuasive gifts as a propagandist and polemicist. Sadly,
<cite>Contact and Commune</cite> suggests that he's still
stuck.</p>

<p>The story is told from the point of view of an Earth expedition
to the asteroid 5023 Eris (all hail Discordia!), which encounters
there a variety of lifeforms from the Earth of another timeline.
The asteroid's inhabitants, representatives of a superior
200-million-year-old civilization, are of course all
anarcho-libertarian adherents of the Non-Coercion Principle, and
the Earth visitors are dazzled by the magnificence of it all. As
usual, Smith makes the most of the plot's opportunities for
anti-Statist broadside.</p>

<p>But mellerdrammer swiftly intrudes. Not because it begins to
look as one of the Earth-humans has murdered a native -- that's
necessary plot conflict. No -- but Smith produces an unecessary and
implausible premise that the US has gone so Marxist that it carries
a hammer and sickle on its flag. Why?</p>

<p>The viewpoint characters must solve a murder mystery in a wildly
alien environment. But that plot element tends to get lost in the
furniture -- and a lot of talking-heads scenes as the characters
argue philosopy. Intellectuals will love this; everybody else will
yawn ("But it was the very <em>best</em> philosophy...").</p>

<p>The plot resolution, when it comes, is so psychologically
implausible as to be funny, and leaves several loose ends dangling
in midair. But that doesn't really matter -- it's tucked away in
the last four pages. If you're going to enjoy this book, you'll
have already got your money's worth out of the scenery and
disputation by the time the plot rolls up.</p>

<p>I cling to my hope that L. Neil Smith will write a truly great
novel someday. He's got a Rafael Sabatini pastiche out in hardback
called <cite>Henry Martyn</cite> that looks at first glance to be
considerably better than <cite>Contact And Commune</cite>; let's
hope he continues to improve.</p>
