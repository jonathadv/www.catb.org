<h1 class="c1">Raymond's Reviews #7</h1>

<p>This Raymond's Review changes the usual format slightly; it
consists of five capsule reviews of recent releases that don't need
a lot of comment.</p>

<pre>
%T The Thirteenth Majestral
%A Hayford Pierce
%I Tor Books
%D May 1989
%O paperback, $3.95
%P 315
%G 0-812-54892-2
</pre>

<p>This book is a screamingly funny sendup of Jack Vance's writing
style by the author of <cite>Napoleon Disentimed</cite> and the
Chap Foey Rider stories in <cite>Analog</cite> magazine. If you are
a Vance fan, <em>do</em> not miss it!</p>

<pre>
%T The Founder
%A Christopher Rowley
%I Del Rey
%D Dec 1989
%O paperback, $3.95
%P 251
%G 0-345-33175-3
</pre>

<p>A basically forgettable prequel set in the world of <cite>The
War For Eternity</cite> and <cite>The Black Ship</cite>. It doesn't
tell us anything about Fenrille we didn't already know from the
other books and is too slight to stand on its own. Unless you are a
completist about series, forget it.</p>

<pre>
%T A Fearful Symmetry
%A James Luceno
%I Del Rey
%D Dec 1989
%O paperback, $3.95
%P 265
</pre>

<p>Nazi magicians menace the Earth! Can our heroes figure out
what's going on in time to Save The Day? Can the reader figure out
what's going on through Luceno's lumpenprose and spaghetti
plotting? Who knows? Who cares? Avoid this one, it reads like a bad
parody of Stuart Gordon's <cite>Smile On The Void</cite>.</p>

<pre>
%T Ace In The Hole (Wild Cards #6)
%A George R. R. Martin and others
Publisher  Bantam/Spectra (Feb 1990)
%G 0-553-28253-0
</pre>

<p>The Wild Cards books probably share top honors with the Liavek
stories and the first few of the original Thieves' World
anthologies as the best writing to come out of the shared-worlds
fad. <cite>Ace In The Hole</cite> doesn't quite reach the heights
of intensity of the earlier books, but this may be a good thing;
there had been a bit too much slasher-movie psychopathic nastiness
in the mix for my taste. This one leaves me looking forward to
#7.</p>

<pre>
%T Gryphon
%A Crawford Killian
%I Del Rey/Ballantine
%D Aug 1989
%G 0-345-35730-2
</pre>

<p>Tasty hard-SF by the author of the remarkably original novel
<cite>Eyas</cite>. I find Killian's premise that humans have
altered themselves into asocial animals just as implausible as
Asimov's rather similar Spacers, but his picture of an anarchic
abundance culture based on nanotechnology is believable and
fascinating. Then, collectivist aliens invade. Boy, are
<em>they</em> in for a surprise!</p>

<p>Back to a full-length review in the next RR...</p>
