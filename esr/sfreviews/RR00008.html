<p>These books were inevitable -- had to happen, sooner or later.
In a culture where "wizard programmer" has become a term of
folklore, somebody had to figure there was a hit in a novel that
dropped one into a fantasy world and set him to learn wizardry.</p>

<p>Aside from the premise and the cutenesses that directly follow,
these books are very much the same old same old. You shouldn't
necessarily let that stop you from buying them -- I enjoyed the
heck out of them, myself. But then I had a particularly easy time
identifying with "Wiz" Zumwalt -- if I had acne and glasses and no
confidence around women and a besetting fondness for junk food and
the Forth language I'd darn near <em>be</em> him. If you are a UNIX
wizard or anything like one, you'll probably love these books even
as you wince at them.</p>

<p>As our story opens, the Council of the Mighty (aka good guy
wizards, white hats, the home team) is sorely pressed by the evil
machinations of the Dark League (aka nasty bad guy wizards, black
hats, the away team). Patrius, greatest of the Mighty, journeys
into the Wild Wood and risks his all to perform a Great Summoning,
calling across the dimensions the One who can aid the Mighty in
their desperate plight.</p>

<p>Assisting him is his chance-met former apprentice Moira, now a
hedge-witch ministering to the humble folk of the Fringes
(naturally, she's a knockout redhead). The spell succeeds but costs
Patrius his life. When the smoke clears, who should be standing
there but a very confused "Wiz" Zumwalt, until seconds before one
of Silicon Valley's ace hackers.</p>

<p>When Moira discovers that "Wiz" isn't a mage, and that Patrius
has pinned him to her with an infatuation spell, she is furious.
But she contacts another of the Mighty and they set out to discover
what this unpreposessing, magic-less lout might have to offer.</p>

<p>Will Wiz save the world? Will he get the girl? Will there be
lots of adventure and hair-raising scrapes and gaudy magical combat
and groaner puns and hacker in-jokes along the way? Oh, come on.
You already know the answers to all of these, they're those kinds
of books. If you're one of Cook's intended audience, though, it
won't matter that you know where the train is going, you'll enjoy
the ride anyhow.</p>

<p>Baen Books confirms that There Will Be More Of These...</p>

<p>One quibble, though -- somebody ought to have told the author
that backslash isn't a shell prompt!</p>
