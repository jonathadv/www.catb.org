<p>A lot of writers have played with the warrior-mystic-as-savior
idea in SF (see <a href="RR00005.html">RR#5</a>, <cite>The 97th
Step</cite>). John Dalmas has made most of a career out of it.
Occasionally (<cite>The Walkaway Clause</cite>, <cite>The
Yngling</cite>, <cite>The Regiment</cite>) his variations on this
theme have produced adventure SF of considerable originality and
verve. Too often, though, the results have been undistinguished
yard goods -- visceral fun, but all too predictable. Sadly,
<cite>The LizardWar</cite> looks like another bolt of the
generic.</p>

<p>The book begins with a tip-off that advanced aliens are watching
-- then plunges us into the travels of Luis DenUyl. He is a member
of an order of religious warriors attached vaguely to the Catholic
Church, one of the few stable institutions on a holocaust-scarred,
low-technology future Earth. He is sent on a mission to destroy a
bunch of alien lizardoids who have landed their flying saucer in
New England and are gleefully slicing and dicing locals just for
the sadistic thrill of it all.</p>

<p>A great deal of fairly pointless adventuring about is then mixed
with soliquies on the californicated warrior-yoga Luis's ostensibly
Christian teachers have been training him in (they are actually the
advanced aliens, of course). The particular variety of
life-as-a-videogame mysticism we get sermonized about is is a
hobbyhorse of Dalmas's that shows up in every book of his, often to
the exclusion of any other idea content; in this one it often
manifests as a brand of implausible Castaneda-like psychobabble
about "following one's warrior muse".</p>

<p>What plot there is mostly revolves around Luis's
won-her-lost-her affair with a lady warrior, a fellow member of his
Order who is "more advanced" than he. More cannot be said without
telegraphing the plot -- but it is indicative of Dalmas's authorial
obsessions that the resolution of the book is eventually achieved
not by killing the bad-guy aliens but by therapizing them, quite as
if they were a bunch of ditzy Hollywood lushes doing a karmic AA
program with Luis and his pals cast as the ex-drunk
counsellors.</p>

<p>Your reviewer, as it happens, has actually practiced some of the
sorts of spiritual technologies and therapies and martial arts
Dalmas has bees in his bonnet about (that being one reason I keep
reading his stuff). Your reviewer is of the opinion that the
version presented here is a softheaded, silly and denatured parody
of the real things -- junk-food Zen, and watch out for falling hot
tubs. Watts or Suzuki's nonfiction on the subject is nearly as
accessible, but if you insist on being entertained better you
should go watch old <cite>Kung Fu</cite> episodes -- or dig up a
copy of Bruce Holmes's <cite>Anvil Of The Heart</cite> and read
that.</p>

<p>Still and all Dalmas is a competent and occasionally quite
imaginative writer, and he's even peddled a better grade of
mysticism in some of his previous books. I'll probably buy his next
one, and the one after that, hoping that he can outgrow or at least
integrate his obsessions. If he ever does I think he might become a
master :-).</p>
