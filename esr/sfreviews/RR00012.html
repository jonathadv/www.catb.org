<p>I hope it's not news to you that Lois McMaster Bujold is one of
the best new SF writers to come down the pike in the last five
years. She may just be the brightest new star in Jim Baen's
editorial crown to date, though S. M. Stirling looks ready to
challenge for that title if his fourth novel is as gripping as were
the last three (see <a href="RR00003.html">RR#3</a>: <cite>The
Cage</cite>).</p>

<p>Bujold's particular strength, like Stirling's, is an ability to
write military-flavored adventure SF that is simultaneously true to
all the best traditions of genre SF, and also achieves a
psychological truthfulness and originality still too rare in the
field.</p>

<p>She introduced her leading character, Miles Vorkosigan, in
1986's <cite>The Warrior's Apprentice</cite>, and followed that up
shortly afterwards with <cite>Brothers In Arms</cite>. Miles is the
son of one of the most powerful nobles of the feudal, militaristic
society of Barrayar. An assination attempt on his father exposed
him to a teratogenic gas in the womb. He was born, dwarfed and
brittle-boned, into a milieu that hates and fears `mutants' and has
been struggling to meet the deadly challenges of the Barrayaran
warrior's way ever since.</p>

<p>Miles grows into a wry, brilliant and tormented young man who
never dares give in a micron to self-pity or weakness. It is a
measure of Bujold's gift that avoids cliche here; rather than
settling for another of the one-dimensional, demon-driven misfit
types that populate bad SF she creates him as someone made
realistically <em>more</em> human and complex by his ordeals. In
the two novels so far we have seen him begin to make a place in the
world for himself and acquire the beginnings of a self-esteem that
may someday enable him to live at peace with the universe.</p>

<p>This book stitches together three Miles Vorkosigan novellas with
a rudimentary frame story. Two have appeared previously in
<cite>Analog</cite> and a third in the <cite>Freelancers</cite>
anthology. All three are up to spec, though the whole can't be as
good as a true novel of the same length would be. And "up to spec"
from Bujold means really fine stuff by anyone else's standards.</p>

<p>If you're new to the series, try to pick up <cite>The Warrior's
Apprentice</cite> or <cite>Shards Of Honor</cite> (Miles's parents
are the viewpoint characters in that one, set years before he was
born). These explain much about Bujold's universe that
<cite>Borders Of Infinity</cite> takes for granted as background.
But anywhere you start Bujold's work will make a truly excellent
read.</p>
