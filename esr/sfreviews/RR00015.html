</pre>

<p>R. A. MacAvoy's remarkable first novel, <cite>Tea With A Black
Dragon</cite>, earned great praise for its originality and the deft
and delicate handling of the characters. Her output since then has
been erratic, including the rather dismal sequel <cite>Twisting The
Rope</cite> and the popular <cite>Trio For Lute</cite></p>

<p>In <cite>The Third Eagle</cite>, MacAvoy ventures for the first
time into SF. The book is lightweight but fun, a gentle parody of
the hard-man-with-a-mission stories so common in the genre.</p>

<p>The protagonist, Wanbli, is born to a tribe of Wacaan,
genetically modified Amerinds who serve as bodyguards to the
decadent merchants of planet Neunacht. He is a Paint, one of the
tribe's elite of martial-artist/warriors. As the novel opens he is
brooding on how boring his job is. Our Wanbli, you see, has a very
un-Wacaan ambition; he wants to be a movie star.</p>

<p>A victory over two Paints sent to off Wanbli's employer gives
our hero his chance. He takes the money and runs off-planet,
heading for New Benares and the Bright Lights. The Wandering
Innocent he's not, though -- nor is he the secretive, volcanic
Tough Guy. No, our Wanbli is a naive but charming wiseass.</p>

<p>A modest amount of adventure in bed and battle follows, with our
hero carefully modelling himself on his screen idol. He acquires an
alien sidekick -- a fearsome-looking scaly monster with the
personality of a scared rabbit and a predilection for chess and
higher mathematics.</p>

<p>Then, things start to come unstuck. To say more would give away
too much plot -- but Wanbli learns more than he wants to about
dreams and what can happen when they come true. Even the on-the-run
scenes are parodic, though MacAvoy works up a satisfying amount of
action and drama for the climax of the novel.</p>

<p>I read this one in bed after a long day, and I'd say that or a
bathtub is about the perfect setting for it, especially if you've
read too many novels with tough-guy loners in trouble in them
lately -- <cite>The Third Eagle</cite> will make a welcome
antidote.</p>
