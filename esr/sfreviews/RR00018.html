<p>This book isn't science fiction, and it's four years old.</p>

<p>So why am I reviewing it here? Because every science fiction fan
should read it, in order to understand why the real future is
certain to be far stranger and more wonderful than most SF has ever
dared predict.</p>

<p>K. Eric Drexler is the inventor of and chief booster for the
concept of "nanotechnology" -- molecular-scale engineering using
billions of intelligent sub-micron sized fabrication robots. Using
nanotechnology it would be possible to build an "anything box"
which (given the proper elemental raw materials and a design) could
fabricate any desired tool or substance -- including copies of
itself.</p>

<p>Other probabilities include: superstrong materials,
self-repairing fusion reactors, and cell-repair nanomachines able
to cure cancer and prevent or even reverse the effects of
aging.</p>

<p>The stunning message of this book is that nanotechnology is
almost within our grasp; that it implies a world beyond scarcity
economics in which even the "poorest" individuals will command more
wealth than present-day nation-states; and that almost all
pre-nanotechnology futurism and SF are now as quaint and obsolete
as the art-deco "city of the future" illos in old pulpzines.</p>

<p>Drexler builds his case step by careful step. He points out that
biological life itself is based on nano-machinery at the cell
level, and so constitutes a five-billion-year feasibility
demonstration. He then lays out some plausible series of steps by
which we might learn in the near future to construct our own
synthetic "life" forms, generalizing eventually to programmable
nano- fabricators.</p>

<p>Drexler then discusses the truly mind-blowing possibilities of
molecular engineering. Some of his scenarios approach poetry (there
is a charming description of how to build a rocket engine out of
sapphire and diamond, and why you'd want to) but all are firmly
grounded in physico-chemical fact.</p>

<p>But this is not simply a book about engineering predictions.
Drexler goes on to discuss the personal, social and philosophical
issues raised by the prospect of nanotechnology -- including the
immense dangers posed by possible abuses and how we can plan to
meet them. There are enough implications here for several hundred
hard-SF novels.</p>

<p>If the book has a fault, it may be that Drexler's predictions
for AI are overly rosy -- but then, I may know too much about the
field to judge; experts and near-experts are nearly always too
conservative at this kind of prediction (and it is notable in this
respect that Marvin Minsky's foreword raises no such objections).
Happily, the only other respect in which the book has dated is a
positive one; the chapters on the political impact of superpower
"arms races" in nanotechnology were written before the
disintegration of the Communist Bloc.</p>

<p>This book earns an official Raymond's Review Rave with
fractal-leaf cluster. It packs more sense-of-wonder than a
shelf-full of good SF, and -- best of all -- it's going to come
true!</p>
