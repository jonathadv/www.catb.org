<p>In the <cite>Phaid</cite> duology and <cite>Protectorate</cite>,
Mick Farren demonstrated a deft hand at gritty, cinema-verite
scene-setting. Unfortunately, he also demonstrated a penchant for
plots that are such stone bummers that I promised myself I'd never
darken my eyeballs with his prose again.</p>

<p>Well, I relented. And I wish I could say he's changed. But no,
it's the same old Farrenplot -- a bunch of repulsive losers
struggle against each other on the mean streets of an unhappy
future, the likeable characters die horribly, and at the wrapup
humanity is screwed over by alien forces beyond anyone's
control.</p>

<p>The viewpoint character in the opening sequence is a serial
killer who murders and mutilates prostitutes to feed the bloodlust
of an alien mind parasite. It seems there's a thing in the Martian
desert that drives men mad; and the KGB, who runs a chunk of the
Red Planet (get it, nyuk nyuk nyuk?) and isn't having any of that
greasy perestroika kid stuff, has the tightest security blanket in
the Solar System over it.</p>

<p>Intrepid newshawk Lech Hammond lands on Mars looking for a hot
story and smells this one. Several establishing shots of
claustrophobic colony warrens and whacked-out cowboy prospectors
later, he hits the desert with a cameraman, a sidekick, and the
required crusty old-timer. Meanwhile, a local clone of Matt Dillon
and the Soviet colony's blond-sexpot militia chief are running a
police-procedural on the "Martian Ripper". And the U.S. Marines
assemble a mission team to crack the Soviet base that includes --
you guessed it -- the killer.</p>

<p>Hammond and his merry crew spend most of the novel boozing,
bickering, and, uh, interacting with a trio of sleazy hookers. The
sexpot gets packed off to the local Gulag, and the town marshal
chases off after her. The Marine mission team heads for the Soviet
base.</p>

<p>Eventually, they all collide with each other and the alien
artifact. Every nasty consequence you can imagine ensues, and the
human race is stuck with a spreading psychic plague that nobody
could have prevented anyhow. The end.</p>

<p>I'm not opposed to down endings on principle, but it takes more
wisdom that Farren seems to be able to muster to make this one
meaningful. I didn't learn or grow from the pain Farren put his
characters through, and you won't either. The message seems to be
"Give up. Your struggles are futile. The good die young. There is
no exit." Feh...</p>

<p>I dislike paying money for books like this and I'm sorry I
bought this one. Ironically, it showed up in the mail a day later
in my very first freebie- list package. Now I've got <em>two</em>
copies to mulch. Sigh...</p>
