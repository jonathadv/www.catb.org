</pre>

<p>This book is kind of a wish-fulfillment fantasy for sane
feminists -- the story of an idealistic young community activist
who gets accidentally tele- ported out into the big wide galaxy and
carves harself a new career as one of a utopian crew of
interstellar do-gooders.</p>

<p>No, really -- it's not that bad. Well, at least, it's not as bad
as you'd expect from the gooey premise. Consider that similar SF
novels in the past have often devolved into nasty compendia of
collectivist political correctness, anti-male stridency and general
fuzzy-minded blather (Sheri Tepper's <cite>The Gate To Women's
Country</cite> stands out as a recent horrible example, especially
obnoxious because it was so well-written and convincing). Then
thank the Triple Goddess that Coulson has more sense, and can
resist the temptation to lecture (too bad she doesn't write as
well).</p>

<p>OK, so Coulson's "science" is an arrant crock and her galaxy is
riddled with space-opera cliches like near-omnipotent crystalline
beings who lend their Special Powers to the good guys (no
Boskonians, though). The fact remains that this book is, well,
<em>likeable</em> -- naively charming, like a month-old puppy. And
occasionally it displays some real ethical insight amidst its all
its pieties about equality and pacifism and the fundamental
niceness of everybody.</p>

<p>If there's a teenage girl in your life -- you, your daughter,
your sister, your girlfriend -- point her at <cite>Star
Sister</cite>. She'll like it and may even learn a useful value or
two.</p>
