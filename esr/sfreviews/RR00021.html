<p>Sassinak the slavegirl lucks into the interstellar Fleet's
acadamy, trains, graduates, and goes off to fight space pirates in
a nice shiny battlecruiser. The narrative, such as it is, goes by
near as fast as that summary. There's adventure, intrigue, sex, and
lots of things going boom.</p>

<p>You know, there are months when I suspect that Baen books has a
military-fiction quota system -- so many words per quarter of
interchangeable bad guys getting offed by plucky misfits-made-good
wielding designer assortments of sexy hardware.</p>

<p>That's unfair, of course. Writers like Lois McMaster Bujold can
make powerful literature playing off the military-SF form. Writers
like David Drake, on the other hand, can slant it into a kind of
gut-wrenching carnography that's as unforgettable as a kick in the
face (and, in my opinion, considerably more dangerous to the
ethical health than <cite>Debbie Does Dallas</cite>).</p>

<p>Most of the Baen output (and military fiction in general)
occupies a middle ground, neither literature nor carno but a form
of power-fantasy escapism that removes some of the guilt and threat
from untrammelled power fantasies by embedding them in the rigidly
structured context of a military organization. Litterateurs may
sneer at this, but I refuse to -- opening that fantasy-escape
safety valve has been an important function of storytellers since
our ancestors chewed mammoth-steaks around guttering campfires.</p>

<p><cite>Sassinak</cite> is a typical example of this middle
ground, with a twist -- it has two female authors, a female
protagonist and is obviously aimed at the female market. Anne
McCaffrey, of course, is well-known for the Pern books, and
Elizabeth Moon has made quite a splash recently with <cite>The
Deeds Of Paksenarion</cite> (a considerably-better-than-average
fantasy trilogy featuring a female paladin as the viewpoint
character in a Tolkien-like world).</p>

<p>I suppose there could even have been a really good book in here
somewhere. Unfortunately this one isn't written as competently as
most of its type, which is surprising given the authors' track
records -- it reads as though it was dashed off in a hurry with
both of their minds on something else, and thus comes off as
exactly the kind of yard goods Baen is often slammed for peddling.
It should surprise no one that the ending hints heavily of sequels
yet to come.</p>

<p>A Sassinak series. <em>Yawn.</em> Well. Maybe Baen will use the
money it makes to publish something more interesting...</p>
