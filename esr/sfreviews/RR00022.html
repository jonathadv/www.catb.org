<pre>
%T Cat's Gambit
%A Leslie Gadallah
%I Del Rey/Ballantine
%D March 1990
%O paperback, US$3.95
%P 247
%G 0-345-36478-3
</pre>

<p>This book is a competent sequel to Gadallah's earlier
<cite>Cat's Pawn</cite>. The insectoid Kazi have triumphed,
subjugating humanity and nearly exterminating the catlike Oriani.
Talan's daughter, grief-stricken over her stillborn cubs, links up
with the raffish human smuggler MacDonald for a final strike at the
heart of the Kazi empire. For all the melodramatic plot, the style
is quiet, well textured and often wryly humorous, and the
characters made quite believable. Gadallah is a writer to watch; I
think, with a little more maturity, she might produce excellent
work.</p>

<pre>
%T The Hand of Zei
%A L. Sprague deCamp
%I Baen Books
%D March 1990
%O paperback, US$3.50
%P 276
%G 0-671-69865-6
</pre>

<p>There aren't too many reissues from 1950 that wear their age as
well as this one. De Camp's lusty, funny tale of the reluctant hero
Dirk Barnevelt's adven- tures on primitive Krishna is a delight,
whether read as straight adventure or as wry parody of a subgenre
that was foundering under the weight of its own cliches even forty
years ago. For an extra treat, this edition even includes the
serial's original interior illos in-line with the text. It's a bit
of a mystery why Baen labelled this `Fantasy', but what the heck.
Recommended.</p>

<pre>
%T The Scions of Shannara
%A Terry Brooks
%I Ballantine/Del Rey
%D March 1990
%O hardcover, price missing
%P 465
%G 0-345-35695-0
</pre>

<p>If you liked the previous Shannara books, you'll probably like
this one. I think they're mind-numbingly stupid and derivative
myself and couldn't force myself to more than dip into this one,
but I'm just a reviewer. Chacun a son gout.</p>

<pre>
%T Carmen Miranda's Ghost is Haunting Space Station Three
%A Don Sakers (editor)
%I Baen Books
%D March 1990
%O paperback, US$3.95
%P 306
%G 0-671-69864-8
</pre>

<p>This mere <em>blurb</em> on this theme anthology reduced me to a
state of uncontrollable gigglement. Leslie Fish started it all with
an extremely silly filk song. Don Sakers became obsessed with the
idea, Toni Weisskopf at Baen was crazed enough to get it bought,
many writers contributed while still in a state of amazement that
the idea was being done at all, and the results are a collective
masterpiece of loony camp inventiveness. For one book like this
I'll cheerfully forgive a couple of Sassinaks (see RR #21).</p>

<p>SMALL TALK:</p>

<p>Toni Weisskopf at Baen informs me that Elizabeth Moon has a
prequel to the Paksenarrion books in the pipeline -- the life of
the warrior-saint Gird, founder of the Order of Paladins.</p>

<p>One of the GEnie SFRT people informs me that the Collier
<cite>Traveller In Black</cite> I reviewed in <a
href="RR00011.html">RR#11</a> is a essentially a reprint of a
mid-80s edition by Bluejay Books.</p>
