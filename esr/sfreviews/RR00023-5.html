<h1 class="c1">This is Raymond's Reviews #23.5</h1>

<pre>
%T Glasnost and Perestroika
%A Mikhail Gorbachev and the Collapsing Soviet Economy
%I: all major news media
%O: reality, already
</pre>

<p>This near-future thriller of revolutionary change in the
Communist Bloc is compellingly written, but lacks a bit in the
believability department. I mean, seriously...the Evil Empire
broken up and Lenin's "leading role" repudiated by none other than
the General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party himself?</p>

<p>And the authors build up to this implausible scene by stages
that are individually hardly less remarkable. A worker's revolution
in Poland...the Berlin Wall dismantled after massive grass-roots
agitation for reunification with West Germany...the government of
Czechoslovakia peacefully overthrown by a soft-spoken
playwright...the people of Romania rising in wrath to kill their
dictator after 40 years of subservience?! Really...</p>

<p>By the time one gets to the demonstration scene in Red Square
with the placards reading "Workers of the World, We're Sorry!", one
can only laugh. How could the authors have possibly expected us to
credit all this?</p>

<p>Perhaps most bizarre and incredible of all, geopolitically, are
the projections of massive unilateral Soviet troop withdrawals from
Eastern Europe, and of multiparty democracy taking hold in the
Soviet Union. Even before Communism, Russia had been expansionist
and despotic for five centuries; the rapid progress described
toward Western-style government-by-law is just utterly
unbelievable.</p>

<p>Science fiction is supposed to be <em>plausible.</em>
<cite>Glasnost and Perestroika</cite>, for all the gripping drama
of its narrative, certainly isn't. But those of you willing to
suspend disbelief in a wonderfully optimistic wish-fulfillment
scenario will have a great time with it.</p>

<p>Watch for the next in this series, an even wilder-and-woolier
flight of fancy in which the U.S. pays off its budget deficit and
abolishes its government...</p>
