<p>Barbara Hambly has enjoyed a deserved reputation as one of the
better contemporary fantasists ever since her impressive debut with
the Darwath trilogy (<cite>The Time Of The Dark</cite>, <cite>The
Walls Of Air</cite>, <cite>The Army Of Daylight</cite>) in 1982.
She doesn't yet quite match the quirky brilliance of Barry Hughart,
the stunning originality and power of Tim Powers's best work, or
the subtle beauty and fine-drawn characterization of Anne MacAvoy's
best novels; but her writing is solidly crafted, mercifully low in
cliches, and far better than most of the fantasy-labelled yardage
on the shelves of your local chain bookstore.</p>

<p>She demonstrates this again with <cite>The Dark Hand of
Magic</cite>, third of the "Unschooled Wizard" trilogy after
<cite>The Ladies Of Mandrigyn</cite> and <cite>The Witches Of
Wenshar</cite>.</p>

<p>In <cite>Ladies</cite>, the men of the subject city of Mandrigyn
have been enslaved by the deathless Wizard-King Altiokis. The women
of Mandrigyn kidnap the mercenary captain Sun Wolf to battle-train
them for a desperate attempt to free their husbands and brothers
and sons and lovers. But Sun Wolf is more than he knows; the drug
the women use to coerce him is the substance of the Great Trial
that either kills those born with a hereditary talent for magic or
forges them into wizards. Sun Wolf is one of the mageborn....</p>

<p>Altiokis is defeated, of course. But <cite>Ladies</cite> was not
merely or even mostly about good against evil. Much more of it is
about a subtler trial -- Sun Wolf's discovery at forty that the way
of the warrior is closed to him; and about the hard and unlikely
love he has discovered with the warlady Starhawk, she who had been
his second-in-command and sword-comrade through years of
battle.</p>

<p>Book II continues Sun Wolf's story. The power to use magic is
also a compul- sion, and an unschooled wizard is dangerous. Sun
Wolf sets out to find a teacher. Most of the mageborn are dead,
long since murdered by Altiokis; they few that remain have been in
hiding for so many years that the traditions of the art have been
forgotten. Sun Wolf and Starhawk hear of a teacher in the
desert-edge kingdom of Wenshar -- but what they find there is
horror, mystery and a string of demonic murders. They learn more of
the nature and cost of magic.</p>

<p>In <cite>The Dark Hand of Magic</cite>, Sun Wolf and Starhawk
are reunited with their mercenary company. It has contracted to
beseige the town of Vorsal -- but there is a wizard in Vorsal
powerful enough to hex the troops. Sun Wolf is caught between his
loyalty to his old comrades and his burning need to be taught by a
true mage. But Sun Wolf's most terrible test is still coming --
because the man he's sought as a teacher has both the power and the
malice to enslave him forever.</p>

<p>Hambly builds to a climax almost unbearable in its dark
emotional intensity. The harsh, realistic treatment of mercenary
life is reminiscent of Glen Cook's <cite>Black Company</cite>
novels (though from the publishing histories it would be hard to
make a case for influence, in either direction). These are not
books for the sentimental or goopily romantic; there is nothing
easy about love or magic in Hambly's world, and Sun Wolf pays a
hard price for his growth. In this he is not much like most fantasy
heroes -- but is very much like a real human being.</p>
