<p>The cover describes this book as "a breakthrough novel". Well,
it isn't that, but it is another workmanlike hard SF novel from
Timothy Zahn, author of the <cite>Cobra</cite> books, <cite>Deadman
Switch</cite>, <cite>Cascade Point</cite>, <cite>Triplet</cite>,
and <cite>A Coming Of Age</cite>. Portions of it appeared in
<cite>Analog</cite> in '82 and '84.</p>

<p>A future human society expanding into near interstellar space
has run up against the Tamplissta, a race of humanoid eco-pacifists
who are much unsettled by humanity's "predator nature". Tampy
biotechnology is generally inferior to humanity's machine-based
approach, but in one critical area they hold an enormous advantage
-- space horses.</p>

<p>Space horses are huge vacuum-dwelling animals who eat asteroids
and can teleport between regions of equal gravitational potential
over interstellar distances. Space horses detest humans, who are
thus stuck with a slower mechanical stardrive. Despite earnest
efforts on both sides, friction between Tampies and humans is
growing. As the novel begins, war seems imminent.</p>

<p>Captain Haml Roman is selected to command the
<cite>Amity</cite>, a mixed-crew exploration ship with which the
human peace faction hopes to prove that humans and Tampies can
successfully cooperate over the long haul. Human hawks saddle him
with Chayne Ferrol as his exec, a man with a bitter grudge against
the Tampies.</p>

<p>As a model for human-Tamplissta cooperation, Amity's first
cruise becomes a near-disaster. But several striking facts come to
light. One is that the presence of humans stimulates space horses
to breed; another is that there are other creatures from the
space-horses' home ecology around -- and some of them are predators
that may be able to tolerate human handlers.</p>

<p>These revelations may offer a path away from confrontation, if
Tamplissta philosophy can be taken at face value. But are the
Tampies as benign as they claim? Chayne Ferrol believes they are
not, and Tampy arrogance during the Amity's voyage seems to bear
him out. And why is it that the Tampies, past masters of
bioengineering and supposed "friends of all nature", never got
their space horses to reproduce before humans came along?</p>

<p>Yes, this story has a moral -- but it may not be the one you
expect. I think Zahn intended it at least partly as a comment on
the virtues and vices of "eco-think" in humans -- the ending, read
on that level, is very pointed. Read it for the idea content and
the nifty space scenes (one is set in the accretion disk around the
Cygnus X-1 black hole -- yummy!). The characterization is passable
at best and the prose fairly pedestrian.</p>

<p>This is not quite a Chrome-Plated Doohickey winner, because Zahn
fluffs his best idea; he doesn't develop the space-horse ecology
quite far enough to induce that true spine-tingling sensawunda
feeling. It's certainly more original than most supposedly
"better-written" SF, though, and in a month so far dominated by
re-releases and reflections of things past it looks pretty
good.</p>
