<p>This #5 of the Chronicles of the Black Company demonstrates the
besetting problem with series; it's neither as original nor quite
as carefully written as the first four. On the other hand, Glen
Cook is a captivating writer with a uniquely dark, Chandleresque
slant on the fantasy epic. If he can keep shut of the assembly-line
crank-'em-out-for-the-bucks mentality that threatens this series he
may yet become an SF/fantasy writer of the first rank.</p>

<p>At the disaster of Dejagore (see the end of <cite>Shadow
Games</cite>) Croaker is shot through the chest beside the
Company's standard, but does not die; he is removed from the
battlefield by the same black-cowled Presence that has dogged the
Black Company through their march south from the Sea of Torments.
Lady, believing him dead, swears vengeance on the Shadowmasters and
begins to re-form the Company around the few survivors; she becomes
both Annalist and Captain.</p>

<p>The Presence, it develops, is none other than the Taken called
Soulcatcher, Lady's sister and bitter enemy. She has saved Croaker
to be the tool of her vengeance. And as Lady threads her way though
the intrigues of Taglios, she finds that her new allies may be as
dangerous as her enemies -- for they are the Stranglers, the
murder-cult of the Dark Mother. They believe Lady is the
long-prophesied Daughter of Night, the bloody messiah they have
awaited for a thousand years. All her plans will unravel if they
discover they have the wrong woman -- and more terrifying yet is
the possibility that they do not.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, far to the south, there are things stirring on the
Plain of Glittering Stone, the accursed place that may long ago
have been the Company's home city of Khatovar. If the Black Company
fulfills its contract with the Taglians, the Shadowmasters' last
resort may be to loose those evils on the world...</p>

<p>This is fun stuff, and nowhere near as predictable as the
purple-prose synopsis above above might suggest. Cook is very good
at writing <em>against</em> the expectations of the fantasy form;
his dialogue and prose style have a cynical, gritty, naturalistic
edge much more like the best film noir than Tolkien or contemporary
fantasists. It's a technique that helps make the fantastic elements
in the plot more believable, and more vivid by contrast. And it's
well suited to depicting a milieu in which the choices are usually
not between good or evil, but between evil and greater evil.</p>

<p>We do find out a bit more about the mission of the original
Black Company toward the end of the book -- enough to know that it
was a response to the same events that gave birth to the Strangler
cult. The next and last book, <cite>Glittering Stone</cite>, should
draw the final veils aside. I'm looking forward to it.</p>
