<p>In her recent trilogy, <cite>The Deed Of Paksenarrion</cite>,
Elizabeth Moon proved herself a skilled and original practitioner
of the art of the fantasy novel. These stories demonstrate that
she's better yet at short-story SF.</p>

<p><cite>Lunar Activity</cite> collects eleven short stories. Eight
of these first appeared in <cite>Analog</cite> over the last four
years; two others are SF reprinted from F&amp;SF, and the last (as
the publisher's blurb breathlessly notes) is an original set in the
world of Paksenarrion and, indeed, featuring Paksenarrion as a
character (though not as protagonist).</p>

<p>The <cite>Analog</cite> stories are very good. Moon has a knack
for exposition and the telling detail; her prose is clean,
transparent, effective and very much in the tradition of what hard
SF should be like. But she doesn't fall back on cliche, ever; in
fact, she seems to enjoy writing from angles that confound and
reverse the reader's genre-formed expectations. There is little of
world-sweeping drama or clenched-jaw heroics here, just the quiet
courage of ordinary people refusing to fail.</p>

<p>The F&amp;SF stuff is weaker; one story (<cite>If Nudity Offends
You</cite>) is rather slight and enigmatic, another (<cite>New
World Symphony</cite>) very interesting in concept and detail but
ultimately not credible. The original, the anthology's only
fantasy, has the same strengths and flaws as the Paksenarrion
trilogy itself; it is grippingly and convincingly told, but tends
towards a vaguely priggish oversimplification of what good and evil
in human beings are actually like.</p>

<p>Overall, this book is definitely worth your time; even the
failures are interesting. Though I'd read some of them in
<cite>Analog</cite>, I'd failed to connect them with the
Paksenarrion books and hadn't realized how strong an SF writer Ms.
Moon is. I finished the anthology with much more respect for and
interest in her writing than I had when I began it, and will be
following her future work closely for signs that she is maturing
from journeyman into master.</p>
