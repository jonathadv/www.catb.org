<p><cite>Kaleidoscope</cite> is this month's classiest act from Del
Rey -- an anthology of good stuff from Harry Turtledove (aka Eric
Iverson), author of the fantasy <cite>Videssos Cycle</cite>,
<cite>Noninterference</cite>, and long one of <cite>Analog</cite>'s
best short-story contributors.</p>

<p>This anthology has many of the strengths I praised in Elizabeth
Moon's <cite>Lunar Activity</cite> (<a
href="RR00030.html">RR#30</a>). Turtledove is maybe a little better
at the `traditional' SF virtues of idea content, action, and `sense
of wonder', and maybe a shade less good at characterization. For my
taste this makes him marginally the better SF writer of the two;
others may differ.</p>

<p><em>I</em> think this book is worth its cover price just for
<cite>The Boring Beast</cite>, a side-splittingly funny pastiche of
the Howardian sub-genre in which Condom the Trojan (duhh...) does
battle with the evil sorcerer Sloth-Amok...but then I have a low
mind and an affinity for slapstick.</p>

<p>The SF high points of the anthology include <cite>And So To
Bed</cite>, <cite>Bluff</cite>, <cite>The Road Not Taken</cite>,
and <cite>Hindsight</cite>, all excellent stories which appeared in
<cite>Analog</cite> and in various ways exemplify what has always
been most valuable about that magazine. <cite>Hindsight</cite>
includes one scene which has stuck with me for years ever since I
first read it; an utterly convincing portrait of the reaction of an
intelligent person from 1953 to modern high-voltage rock guitar
that condescends to neither the person nor the music.</p>

<p>Turtledove also demonstrates that he's capable of fantasy more
lyrical than the enjoyable but somewhat heavy-handed <cite>Videssos
Cycle</cite>, in the back-to-back stories <cite>The Castle Of The
Sparrowhawk</cite> and <cite>The Summer Garden</cite>. And he
presents us with a horror-tinged vampire fantasy that manages to be
charming in <cite>Gentlemen Of The Shade</cite>.</p>

<p>Like <cite>Lunar Activity</cite>, this anthology gives us a nice
cross-section of the work of a promising journeyman writer who may
mature into a master of the genre. I think Turtledove needs to get
looser, less afraid to take chances, and maybe step away a little
from the role of "Analog writer"; this anthology makes it clear
that he has a wider range, and I think even his hard SF would
benefit if he exercised it more.</p>
