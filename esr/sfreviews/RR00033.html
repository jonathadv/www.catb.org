<p>No, this is not the silly-but-fun item of slapstick that pits
New York street punks against the stars -- that <cite>Illegal
Aliens</cite> was by Nick Pollotta and Phil Foglio, and it was
fun.</p>

<p>This is the second SF novel by the author of <cite>A Fearful
Symmetry</cite>, an industrial-strength turkey I reviewed in <a
href="RR00007.html">RR#7</a>. It would be nice to report that
Luceno was just having an off day when he wrote that, but
unfortunately the best thing one can say about this book is that
it's better than <cite>Symmetry</cite>.</p>

<p>Remy Santoul, tough-guy agent for the interstellar conglomerate
NCorp, lands on primitive Q'aantre assigned to discover why their
native spy network isn't producing -- and if possible to stymie the
e-vile plans of the Xellem, a bunch of ersatz-Mayan nasties intent
on scarfing up the planet for reasons that are left just as obscure
as NCorp's.</p>

<p>His rezident is a human xenologist who's `gone native' among the
catlike indigenes. He claims there is some kind of Major Secret
tied up in the Q'aantre's reproductive biology, and...oh? you've
read this one before? Yes, so have I, too many times. We just
<em>know</em> that Remy's going to have a Transformative Experience
and discover the virtues of alien rusticity with some exotic-eyed
alien bimbette, and then cleverly cross up both NCorp and the
e-vile Xellem, and that the process will involve a whole bunch of
mean-streets setpiece scenes and lots of gunfire and skulking about
playing with high-tech espionage toys. Sigh....</p>

<p>Regular RR readers should know by this time that I won't
necessarily torch a book for being derivative if it's a fun read,
nor do I require that everything I praise be an intellectually
stimulating or `morally uplifting' Serious Experience. There's a
place in the world for potboiler; it scratches fantasy itches that
people need scratched. Even a set-up and plot this tired and
shopworn can be satisfying if it's done right.</p>

<p>Here, though, it's not. The book is painfully boring -- it comes
off as just an unimaginative mess of genre cliches and ingratiating
pop-culture references. However, in a perverse way it gives me hope
for Luceno, because <cite>A Fearful Symmetry</cite> was so much
worse. If he continues to improve at this rate, his next novel may
be something I won't feel like handling with insulated tongs
only.</p>
