<p>These are the first two volumes of <cite>Memory, Sorrow, and
Thorn</cite>, an epic fantasy trilogy by the author of
<cite>Tailchaser's Song</cite>. In them, Williams tells the story
of Simon, the scullion boy of Castle Hayholt, a gangly dreamer who
has just begun to find a niche in life apprenticed to the magician
Dr. Morgenes when his world is shattered by the machinations of the
evil priest Pryrates.</p>

<p>The High King, Elias, has fallen under Pryrates's influence; and
Pryrates is himself a tool of the undead Storm King, Ineluki. The
Storm King, once the greatest of the immortals men call Sithi, has
brooded over his revenge for five centuries; now he is ready to
strike. A freezing winter is howling down from the north of the
world, fell things walk out of the wastelands, and the King of all
Osten Ard is descending into madness.</p>

<p>Simon is forced to flee the castle and seek out Prince Josua,
the King's unworldly brother, for only Josua can rally Osten Ard
against the Storm King's minions. Simon's ties to Morgenes involve
him in the quest for the three Swords of Power which may (if
prophecy is correct) be the key to the Storm King's undoing.</p>

<p>But Simon himself may be more than anyone but the Storm King
knows. He saves the life of a prince of the Sithi twice; he strikes
a blow against the dragon Igjarjuk and lives; and the hell-huntsmen
of Ineluki's dread queen seek him with a special malice. And,
increasingly, he dreams prophetic dreams...</p>

<p>These books are wonderfully written, but they wear their sources
far too plainly on their sleeves. Castle Hayholt is too like
Gormenghast; the Church of Usires Aedon is too like Christianity;
the Rimmersmen are too obviously land-bound Vikings; the `trolls'
are mountain-dwelling Eskimos; the Hernystiri are idealized pagan
Welshmen; Ineluki and his Red Hand are Morgoth and the Nazgul in
drag; et painful cetera. They read almost as if Williams thought it
would be cute to be so obvious -- and matters are not helped by the
ingenuous little note at the beginning of Volume I suggesting that
in Osten Ard, things are not always what they seem.</p>

<p>Williams has obvious gifts for descriptive writing and
characterization -- but I never quite overcame my uneasy feeling
that I was being had by a writer who is either incapable of real
originality or out to work quotation of myths and other fantasists'
motifs into some kind of intentional pastiche of the entire genre.
For example: when his pseudo-Viking Rimmersmen started talking
about "Udun One-Eye" my suspension of disbelief just shattered; if
you're writing about an entire secondary world supposedly
unconnected to ours it just doesn't <em>do</em> to run historical
god-names through a phonetic Cuisinart and think you've created a
convincing pantheon.</p>

<p>Newcomers to the genre would likely find the books' flaws much
less obtrusive. It must be said that at the microlevel of prose
construction, descriptive vividness and the telling detail of
character Williams is very good and very involving; better, indeed,
than most of the writers his world recalls. If those are the
qualities you like in fiction, you will really enjoy these books.
The third and final volume, <cite>To Green Angel Tower</cite>, is
already in the works.</p>
