<p>For Jason Karst, the first officer of the hyperspace liner
<cite>Redshift</cite>, things begin to go wrong the night he saves
a passenger from suicide. Two days later, she turns up dead --
murdered. And solving a murder mystery has a few extra wrinkles in
an environment where lightspeed is ten meters per second and a
jogger can easily run past the speed of sound.</p>

<p>That mystery will solve itself all too soon when his ship is
hijacked to the retreat planet of Xanahalla by a gang of thieves
intent on looting the fabulous riches of the Tower of Worship. If
Jason and his ship are to survive he must foil their plans. And,
unknown to him, a greater evil out of his own nightmared past waits
beneath the Tower...</p>

<p>The <cite>Redshift</cite> is a wonderful and extremely weird
place to set a novel like this; one in which time dilation and
other bizarre relativistic effects are visible and important at
normal human scale. It is fascinating to watch Stith work out the
details and implications of the environment's bizarre physics in
the novel, especially in those sections where Karst uses his own
superior grasp of them to confound the villains (Stith,
delightfully, includes an appendix discussing these in more detail
and laying out the equations and figures he used in constructing
the <cite>Redshift</cite>).</p>

<p>With his first two novels (<cite>Scapescope</cite> and
<cite>Memory Blank</cite>) John Stith staked out an interesting
niche somewhere between the hard-SF novel and the thriller writer.
Both were solid but minor, the work of a promising apprentice at a
very demanding craft.</p>

<p><cite>Redshift Rendezvous</cite> aspires to a good bit more than
either of Stith's previous SF outings that I've seen, both
conceptually and psychologically. It's not the major novel I had
hoped for, if only because the universe that gives context to the
<cite>Redshift</cite> and Xanahalla is never made real to the
reader as more than a flat stage set, and the characters remain too
simple.</p>

<p>All these criticisms aside, though, the book is a damn crackling
good read -- better thought out and more exciting than at least 85%
of what you'll see on the racks this year. For me it makes Stith's
next novel a must-buy; the man is clearly Going Places as an
author, and if he isn't quite up there yet with Brin and Niven and
Clarke and Moffit and Hogan he's at least within hailing distance
and heading in the right direction.</p>

<p>One Chrome-Plated Doohickey with fractal-leaf cluster award to
John Stith for Writing a Really Tasty One With Rivets, and my hope
that next time he'll set his sights on a really <em>big</em> novel
with a rich and fully-realized world in it. Meanwhile, hard-SF and
suspense/action fans will have a ball with <cite>Redshift
Rendezvous</cite> -- and maybe some extra fun poking holes in the
notional physics.</p>
