%T Imperial Lady: a Fantasy of Han China
%A Andre Norton &amp; Susan Shwartz
%I TOR Books
%D May 1990
%O paperback, US$3.95
%P 293
%G 0-812-50722-3
</pre>

<p>This book tells the tale of Lady Silver Snow, born the only
daughter of a general in disgrace, who through courage redeems the
fortunes of her house and becomes queen of the Hsiung-nu nomads
beyond China's Great Wall. It is based (as an afterword explains)
on the life of a historical person, but includes a tasty soupcon of
fantasy elements.</p>

<p>This collaboration bears comparison in many ways to Susan
Shwartz's solo fantasy <cite>Silk Roads and Shadows</cite> (see <a
href="RR00045.html">RR#45</a>). Both use the glitter of Imperial
China and the great steppes of Central Asia as background; both
present strong stories of women who, though misfits in their own
cultures, find the strength to represent what is best of them in
alien lands.</p>

<p>If <cite>Imperial Lady</cite> misses something of the depth and
impact of <cite>Silk Roads</cite>, it also avoids that book's major
flaw; Lady Silver Snow seems far less out of place in her time than
the Princess Alexandra did in hers. If one can accept the initial
premise that a Han Chinese general would teach his daughter to ride
and shoot the bow, Silver Snow's character and choices seem
relatively plausible.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, this book has more the flavor of a juvenile (like
most of Norton's solo work). The plot is a simple one, turning on
duty and love and involving only two major confrontations in both
of which the issues are far clearer-cut than in Alexandra's
initiatory struggle on the Diamond Path. No-one in <cite>Imperial
Lady</cite> ever becomes quite as three-dimensional as Alexandra
and her friends in <cite>Silk Roads</cite>.</p>

<p>The prose is in a somewhat more high-flown and pseudo-archaic
mode than <cite>Silk Roads</cite>, but that's appropriate to the
book's atmosphere. It works. All in all, I'd say this is acceptable
escape reading, especially for the teenagers it seems to be aimed
at; others without my particular fondness for oriental fantasy may
find it rather slight.</p>
