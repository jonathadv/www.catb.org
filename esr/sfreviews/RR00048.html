<p>The first thing you'll notice about this book is that Jo
Clayton's prose crackles like bright neon. The second thing you'll
notice is that you like the viewpoint character Shadith, a
twenty-millennium-old mind recently "decanted" into the body of a
sixteen-year-old girl. The third thing you'll notice is the plot,
which is, well, more ordinary.</p>

<p>Shadith, running from trouble, stumbles into bigger trouble --
one Ginbiryol Seyirshi, an artistic sadist who choreographs the
death of worlds and the self-destruction of planetary populations
for a select audience of the rich and twisted. He decides she's
just what she needs to round out his trio of `Avatars' --
buman/alien catalysts who should fit the mythology of the oppressed
castes on his target world Kiskai and by their very presence
trigger the explosion he wants to record in all its gruesome
full-sensory detail.</p>

<p>Shadith, the felinoid Rohant and the reptilian Kisken are
dropped in the bush country of Kiskai. Their choices seem simple;
they can live (by acting out the roles of Virgin Singer, Hunter,
and Dancer of God) and bring on Ginbiryol's cataclysm, or they can
die. And with every hour they spend on Kiskai, dying looks more
likely...</p>

<p>What makes all this work is Clayton's authorial voice --
sensual, startling, allusive, playful, slangy, and vivid as hell
(in some ways reminiscent of Alfred Bester or Tom Robbins). It
makes me want to go out and read the Diadem books, which I wrote
off back when they were first published largely because of the
cheesy DAW covers and the impression that they were just another
silly random space opera. <cite>Shadowplay</cite> is loosely
connected to these, as was Clayton's recent but less exciting
<cite>Shadow Of The Warmaster</cite>; Shadith was a minor character
in <cite>Warmaster</cite> and the <cite>Diadem</cite> books.</p>

<p>Yes, I'm impressed. After months of reading the usual
serviceable-but-tepid SF genre prose, this book goes down like a
dash of chilled seltzer and lime. One official Raymond's Reviews
Roman Candle award for Delightful Prose Fireworks and No
Pretensions goes to <cite>Shadowplay</cite>, and a heartfelt wish
for more like it.</p>

<p>And more there will be...the ending is a clear set-up for a
sequel as Seyirshi escapes off-screen in the nick of time and our
friends vow vengeance. I'm looking forward to it.</p>
