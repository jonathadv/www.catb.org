<p>This is the concluding volume of the `Voyagers' trilogy, a
turgid near-future space-opera aimed straight and successfully at
the best-seller market -- and if fans needed more evidence that
even mediocre genre SF is more intelligent <em>and</em> better
written than the mainstream mega-potboilers `Voyagers' apes so
successfully, they wouldn't need to look any further than this
book.</p>

<p>In <cite>Voyagers</cite>, we got the story of the manipulative,
hard-driving genius Keith Stoner; ex-astronaut turned SETI
physicist who detects a radio signal that speaks to him of aliens.
He battles his way through the predictable maelstrom of intrigue,
politics and treachery to a meeting with the aliens' starcraft in
high orbit around Earth. A melodramatic last-minute plot twist
forces him to gamble...to attempt to cryo-freeze himself and await
a possible rescue when his long orbit brings him back near
Earth.</p>

<p>In <cite>Voyagers II: Star Brothers</cite> Jo Camerata, the
(predictably luscious) young woman who assisted Stoner (and was
used and discarded by him) matured (surprise!) into a Captain of
Industry with enough megabucks to engineer his rescue and fall into
his arms. He returns to Earth. But within his mind, an alien
presence lurks, lending him Weird Powers with which to trash the
bad guys. Is it a true friendly? Is it insidiously dangerous? Will
we prow through hundreds of pages of bestseller formula prose to
find out?</p>

<p>Now we get <cite>Voyagers III: Star Brothers</cite>. Yup, it's a
friendly... and it's Stoner and his alien buddy and wifey Jo off to
Save The World against the insidious machinations of a cabal that
aims to Take Over using -- gasp -- nanotechnological weapons! Can
They Be Stopped?</p>

<p>Sigh. The best face one can put on this rolling disaster is that
it might persuade a few bestseller readers to take a look at some
real SF. On the other hand, it might leave more believing that all
SF is this mindless.</p>

<p>Honesty compels me to admit that (though he's never been more
than a second-ranker) Bova has done much better work in the past
(though not in <cite>Colony</cite> or his other would-be
bestsellers). He probably knows full well that he wrote a load of
what SF fans would call utter crap, and doesn't care because it
outsold most serious SF by a long light-year. In fact, I suspect
that if he saw this review he'd just laugh and riffle a royalty
check. Well, it's his reputation.</p>

<p>Perhaps if he ever goes back to writing for the SF audience we
might see some passable stuff from him. In the meantime, Raymond's
Reviews gives the whole Voyager series (especially III) a
Gold-Plated Mega-Crock Award for Conspicuous Bestellerism and
Malignant Stupidity and recommends that you avoid it as you would
the plague.</p>
