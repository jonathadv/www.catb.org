<p>Michael Kube-McDowell made a startlingly powerful debut in his
trilogy "The Trigon Disunity" (<cite>Emprise</cite>,
<cite>Enigma</cite>, and <cite>Empery</cite>), then gave us an
original and unusual alternate-Universe novel in
<cite>Alternities</cite>. In <cite>The Quiet Pools</cite> he has
produced a satisfying "big" novel in the Campbellian tradition of
celebrating the human drive to techno-transcendence, perhaps marred
by a too-conscious effort to cross over into the best-seller big
leagues.</p>

<p>In the author's future, the megacorporation Allied Transcom is
struggling to launch the second starship of the Diaspora project,
an ambitious plan to spread viable human colonies through near
interstellar space. Opposed are the eco-terrorists of the Homeworld
underground, a conspiracy bent on keeping the `best and brightest'
on Earth to repair her shattered ecologies. Caught in the middle is
Christopher McCutcheon, a hypertext librarian for Diaspora who
discovers that the Homeworld network's secrets are interwoven with
his own painful past.</p>

<p>The Homeworld network is prepared to murder and vandalize
without limit to achieve its ends -- the choice between the two
should be easy. But Chris begins to understand that the few who run
Transcom are hiding their own dark secret, some terrible knowledge
that could shatter and reshape humanity's concept of history and of
its very self. And that it is is within <em>his</em> power to make
the choice that will take humanity to the stars or bind it back to
Earth, possibly forever.</p>

<p>This book is a well-written execution of a provocative premise.
If hard-core SF fans may find the issues involved a mite too
obvious, well, that's what makes them fans; they should be glad
this isn't another complete crossover turkey like
<cite>Voyagers</cite> (see <a href="RR00049.html">RR#49</a>).</p>

<p>My biggest problem with this book, believe it or not, was the
amount of gratuitous sex'n'violence in it. Now, the sex scenes were
well written and I have never been accused of prudishness, but I
several times felt as if the narration was leaving off something
interesting to tug at my genitals. And there was one particularly
harrowing scene involving the brutal murder of a young woman that
could just as well (for plot purposes) have been left to inference
-- it belonged in a slasher movie, not an SF novel purporting to
address some fairly serious speculations about the destiny of
intelligence.</p>

<p>Yes, this sort of thing goes on a lot in junk genre fiction. I
think Kube-McDowell can do better than that; I think this novel was
a serious attempt to do better, and I'm disappointed that he felt
it necessary (or perhaps was forced) to stoop to such
pandering.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I recommend this one (with reservations),
especially to hard-SF fans. Buy it in paperback.</p>
