%T Doctor's Orders
%A Diane Duane
%I Pocket Books
%D June 1990
%O paperback, US$4.50
%P 291
%G 0-671-66189-2
</pre>

<p>In case you haven't noticed yet, Diane Duane is one helluva fine
writer. In fact, she's so good that she can turn the invitation to
hack-work that Yet Another Star Trek Novel presents into an
armature for some of the best-detailed and most compelling
world-building in the field today. She did it in <cite>The Wounded
Sky</cite>. She did it <em>big-time</em> in <cite>Spock's
World</cite> -- and she does it again in <cite>Doctor's
Orders</cite>. Even if you didn't like the TV series, buy this one
and enjoy.</p>

%T The Year of the Quiet Sun
%A Wilson Tucker
%I Collier/Macmillan
%D May 1990
%O paperback, US$4.50
%P 252
%G 0-02-029895-1
</pre>

<p>Another handsome reissue from the Collier Nucleus series, of
1970 time-travel story I'd heard was a minor classic. Sadly, I
found it so dated I couldn't finish it -- the plot, which involves
time travelers exploring <em>forward</em> from 1978 into 1980 and
beyond, necessarily gets into a great deal of predictions of events
in 1990's past that now seem ridiculously wide of the mark. The
writing is interesting, but not interesting enough to overcome this
handicap.</p>

<pre>
%T Wolfwalker
%A Tara K. Harper
%I Del Rey/Ballantine
%D May 1990
%O paperback, US$3.95
%P 310
%G 0-345-36539-9
</pre>

<p>When I first saw the cover illo and read the back-cover blurb
and Anne McCaffrey's plug for this book, I said to myself "Oh,
Goddess -- not another formula menstrual-blood-and-guts fantasy!"
But I'm happy to report that this one rises above type through the
sheer crackling energy and electric zest of the writing. The
world-building is better than average, too; but then, by the time
you've read a third of this book you'll realize that the fantasy
elements are actually pegged to an SF premise. Do yourself a favor
-- ignore the misleading category box Del Rey dropped this one
into, buy it, and enjoy.</p>

<pre>
%T Warrior's Woman
%A Johanna Lindsey
%I Avon
%D June 1990
%O paperback, US$5.95
%P 422
%G 0-380-75301-4
</pre>

<p>This book, by an acclaimed romance author, actually straddles
two genres. Cover illustration and plot line -- assertive yet
virginal female meets the ONE man who can best her AND meet her
sexual needs -- reveal this to be the variety of romance novel
often called a "bodice ripper." Yet the setting is strictly science
fiction -- the woman is a first-class security officer from a
spacefaring civilization and the "warrior" is a barbarian leader of
the native race on a planet her people are investigating. The
result? A pleasant, well-written, and psychologically senstive
sex/romance fantasy, peopled with believable characters, and a
story which, though formulaic, doesn't insult the intelligence.
Ideal summer poolside reading for femfen who are into red-blooded
romance. [Our thanks to guest reviewer Cathy Olanich, I wouldn't
have touched this one with a ten-foot pole myself -- ESR]</p>
