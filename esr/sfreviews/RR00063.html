<p>No, this isn't really the complete Alfred Bester pastiche the
publisher would have you think -- despite the comparison to
<cite>The Demolished Man</cite> on the cover and the illo with it
that's designed to resemble the paperback cover from <cite>The
Deceivers</cite> and the invocation of Bester's name in the
blurb.</p>

<p>Bester was crazier and more brilliant than <cite>Cortez On
Jupiter</cite> ever gets. Not that this novel is boring or entirely
without the wacko nature, but it'd have been better for the author
and the reader if the bloody marketing department at TOR had let it
stand on its own. I find what they did a rather tasteless abuse of
Bester's memory.</p>

<p>Once you get past this, though, the novel is pleasant enough.
The protagonist is a Chicano graffiti artist with an attitude, a
macho muchacho from the streets of 21st-century LA who spraypaints
his way into high orbit and eventually out to an encounter with
alien intelligences on Jupiter.</p>

<p>Pablo Cortez bacame an artist after his neo-Aztec parents died
of a drug overdose, leaving him only the storyboards for a series
of cartoons based on Aztec mythology. He grows into an
individualism so complete that it rejects the plastic
`counter'-cultures of the 21st century, his art a high-voltage
electric mix of 20th-century retro-pop, grafitti, surrealism and
the sinister imagery of Aztec myth.</p>

<p>After 15 minutes of fame as the exposed founder of the Guerilla
Muralists Pablo and his mad-scientist friend Waldo get kicked
upstairs -- to Earth orbit and the Space Culture Project, a group
of artists founded to originate new forms of expression for the
nascent cultures of zero-G.</p>

<p>Waldo's kinetic robot sculptures (which sound like more benign
versions of the Survival Research Labs monster-machines) go over
big. Pablo's splatterpainting, a medium he invents for zero-G,
doesn't. After a number of dramedic misadventures, he signs up as a
test candidate for the Siren Project, the attempt to make contact
with the sentience which seems to crackle electrically in Jupiter's
atmosphere.</p>

<p>Trouble is, everyone they've sent in so far has died
mindless...</p>

<p>Now, you know this isn't going to happen to Pablo and that he'll
make contact with the aliens somehow. But the charm in this book
(as in the recent and in some ways similar <cite>Angel
Station</cite>, <a href="RR00053.html">RR#53</a>) isn't the
destination but the journey -- the loopy but only somewhat
Besteresque rollercoaster Hogan takes us on through symbol, image,
Pablo's past and the hyperkinetic internal monologue of his
present. Hogan isn't as good at this as Bester was, but by way of
consolation he offers a bit less bumpy a ride.</p>

<p>This is a solid first novel. I don't know if Hogan was really
trying for a Bester pastiche or not, but there's an undertone of
calm and rationality behind his fireworks that I think Bester would
have avoided by design (he seemed to prefer surrealism to the point
of utter overload). If this isn't actually Hogan's voice, it should
be interesting to see what is.</p>
