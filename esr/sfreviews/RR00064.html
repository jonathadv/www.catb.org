Publisher: Ballantine/DelRey<br />

<p>I've observed before (<a href="RR00015.html">RR#15</a>, <a
href="RR00040.html">RR#40</a>) that hard-man-with-a-mission stories
are ubiquitous in SF. In today's post-feminist culture,
hard-woman-with-a-mission stories are fairly common too. The
easiest of these to write are the ones that mix the conventions of
SF with those of the spy thriller -- it's just so bloody easy to
ring those move-them-off-the-shelves changes when your protagonist
is beautiful, a secret agent for some clandestine gang of
do-gooders, and has special transhuman powers, to boot.</p>

<p>Just because this sort of plot and premise is a bit hackneyed by
now doesn't mean that everything that uses it is irredeemable
trash. Most fans deep enough into the field have a soft spot for
James H. Schmitz's Telzey Amberdon and <cite>Agent Of Vega</cite>
stories, for example. What it does mean is that an author using it
owes it to the reader to excel on other levels -- in world-building
or puzzle-crafting, for example, or with characterization that
gives the stereotypic characters of the subgenre extra depth or
surprising twists, or by using the plot to explore some ethical
issue that can only be posed in an SF context.</p>

<p>Sadly, most writers in this subgenre crank out story as if their
readers were just looking for another two-hundred-odd pages of
wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am -- a space-operatic background, a bunch of
action, a little gunplay, lots of things going boom, the obligatory
tangle of treacheries and crossed motives, and a lick or two of
romance; all wrapped up neatly on the last page with a bow and an
exit stage left. Even if they're right, though, it would be nice to
see results with a little more heft than <cite>Mission:
Tori</cite>.</p>

<p>All right (you might say) what can one reasonably expect from a
book blurbed with "Agent Silver's unique talents were her special
edge. But on the planet Tori, that edge could get her killed--or
drive her mad..."? Well -- writing that doesn't insult my
intelligence would be nice. Characters that act really driven and
not like a bunch of high-school seniors playing secret agent would
be, too. And enough respect for astrophysical fact not to hinge the
plot on asteroid fields as thick as flying avalanches would be just
peachy.</p>

<p>Maybe the real tragedy of this book is that it doesn't read like
cynical hackery; it reads like a best effort by a young woman with
good intentions and no clues -- no sense of genre history and
what's already been done to death, and not enough grasp on science
or human nature to know how to be original even if she knew where
to push the envelope.</p>

<p>I could have blown this book off with a capsule review. I've
dissected it at length to set up a couple of points it demonstrates
which I think are important.</p>

<p>One is for would-be authors: that it's not enough just to have
the urge to write; you have to have accumulated enough mental
furniture and experience of life that you can write <em>about</em>
something. Without the furniture, you're apt to find that all you
can write is a bunch of shallow, extended wish-fulfillments that
feature <em>you</em> as the not-so-well-disguised star.</p>

<p>The other is for editors. When a ms like <cite>Mission:
Tori</cite>, flies over the transom, do us all a favor and tell the
author to go away and grow up. You'll be doing him/her a favor,
too.</p>
