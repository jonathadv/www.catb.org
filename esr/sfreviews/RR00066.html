<pre>
%T The Shadow Shaia
%A Alexis Gilliland
%I Del Rey
%D June 1990
%O paperback, US$3.45
%P 213
%G 0-345-36115-6
</pre>

<p>This sequel to <cite>Wizenbeak</cite> has the originality and
quirkiness of that book, but unfortunately not much life of its
own. Mostly we just get to watch the plot wheels of various
characters' machinations go grind, grind, grind. Still, if you
liked Gilliland's
how-Machiavellian-can-we-get-<em>this</em>-chapter style in the
first book you'll probably enjoy this one as well.</p>

<pre>
%T The White Regiment
%A John Dalmas
%I Baen
%D June 1990
%O paperback, US$3.95
%P 406
%G 0-671-69880-X
</pre>

<p>This sequel to the popular <cite>The Regiment</cite> is more of
the author's standard noodling about superior warrior-mystics. The
good news is it's a better-written and saner book than his last,
<cite>The Lizard War</cite> (<a href="RR00010.html">RR#10</a>). The
bad news is that none of it will come as any surprise to longtime
Dalmas readers. Sigh...if only he'd find something new to obsess
about...</p>

<pre>
%T The Swordbearer
%A Glen Cook
%I TOR
%D June 1990
%O paperback, US$3.95
%G 0-812-50307-4
</pre>

<p>I guess this is Glen Cook's answer to the Elric novels -- wimpy
protagonist with huge soul-drinking black sword, etc. etc. Yawn. It
reads as though Cook got as bored while writing it as I did reading
it -- things just sort of ratcheta-ratcheta-ratcheta along
stumbling over familiar furniture, in a world like a tired cross
between the Dread Empire and Black Company books. I rather like
Cook's style ordinarily but this outing is a definite dud.</p>

<pre>
%T Killer
%A David Drake &amp; Karl Edward Wagner
%I TOR
%D June 1990
%O paperback, US$3.95
%P 270
%G 0-812-50984-6
</pre>

<p>Grue, blood, guts and gore. These are a few of David Drake's
favorite things, and they are served up in abundance in this tense
tale of Romans hunting a deadly alien predator. The book is
well-written but as nasty as a slasher movie, rated B for barfbag.
If you like this sort of thing I don't want to know you.</p>

<pre>
%S Death Dealer
%T Plague of Knives
%V #4
%A James Silke
%I TOR
%D June 1990
%O paperback, US$3.95
%P 311
%G 0-812-50332-5
</pre>

<p>Yet another formula sword-and-sorcery series. Just what we
needed -- this one, fer cripes' sake, based on a <em>painting</em>
(one which also has the distinction of having inspired a D&amp;D
character class all by itself). The writing isn't too bad as these
things go but you've seen all the props and characters and most of
the plot elements before.</p>
