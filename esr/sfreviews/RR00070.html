<pre>
%T An Abyss of Light
%A Kathleen M. O'Neill
%I DAW
%D June 1990
%O paperback, US$4.95
%P 463
%G 0-88677-418-7
</pre>

<p>This huge, galumphing, unreadable mess combines hokey space
opera with a muddled take-off on Judaic mysticism. It seems the
Galactic Magistrates wish to force the persecuted Gamants to
relinquish their millenia-old traditions -- including the "mea
shearim", the interdimensional link through which the Gamants speak
with the being they believe is God. Meanwhile, on the Gamant world
of Horeb, a man has risen who claims to be the long-awaited
Mashiah...or maybe he's the anti-Mashiah. I dunno, I couldn't force
myself to read the whole thing and find out. And there's gonna be a
sequel, too. Avoid this baby unless you need kindling or a good
doorstop.</p>

<pre>
%T Thieves' Carnival/The Jewel of Bas
%A Karen Haber/Leigh Brackett
%I TOR
%D June 1990
%O paperback, US$3.50
%P 187
%G 0-812-50272-8
</pre>

<p>Another old-and-new pair from TOR couples a minor classic by
Leigh Brackett with an original prequel to it by Karen Haber.
Brackett's lush, vivid writing has aged reasonably well even though
the props of her stories now seem cliched and the plots a tad on
the melodramatic side. The prequel, which lends more depth to the
characters even though it misses the dreamlike and haunting quality
of Brackett's work, makes an interesting contrast. Nice light
reading, pick it up used.</p>

<pre>
%T The Zork Chronicles
%A George Alec Effinger
%I Avon
%D July 1990
%O paperback, US$4.50
%P 290
%G 0-380-75388-X
</pre>

<p>You've played the game, now read the book! Actually, don't
bother. This pastiche of the famous computer game manages to be
frantically silly without being very funny, like an endless Monty
Python routine that never quite comes off (come to think of it,
I've never quite gotten the point of his serious work, either).
Effinger attempts to introduce some narrative coherence by spoofing
the Hero Myth, but Craig Shaw Gardner and Terry Pratchett have
already done a better job of that one.</p>

<pre>
%T The Great SF Stories 21 (1959)
%E Isaac Asimov &amp; Martin H. Greenberg
%I DAW
%D July 1990
%O paperback, US$5.95
%P 347
%G 0-88677-428-4
</pre>

<p>This is a sort of retrospective Best SF anthology for 1959; it
collects 14 stories the authors feel have best stood the test of
time since. Worth owning for Phillip Jose Farmer's <cite>The Alley
Man</cite>, or Cordwainer Smith's bizarre <cite>No No, Not
Rogov!</cite>, or for Alfred Bester's brilliant <cite>The Pi
Man</cite>. Longtime SF readers will have encountered some of these
stories before in other anthologies.</p>

<p>RECEIVED AND NOT REVIEWED:</p>

<p><cite>Arthur</cite>, Stephen Lawhead.</p>

<p><cite>The Dragon's Carbuncle</cite>, Elizabeth Boyer</p>

<p><cite>The Scroll Of Lucifer</cite>, LLoyd Arthur Eschbach.</p>

<p><cite>Shadow's Realm</cite>, Mickey Zucker Reichert. Life's too
short for all these interminable fantaseries.</p>
