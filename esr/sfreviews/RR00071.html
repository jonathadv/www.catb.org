<p>In the first 108 pages of <cite>Good News From Outer
Space</cite>, one character goes paranoidally mad, another
self-destructs after bungling an arson attempt, and a third is told
that he has cancer of the testicles and must have them removed or
become a zombie. All these events are fraught with symbolic comment
on how doomed any attempts by humans to control their own destinies
are.</p>

<p>Yes, it's another one of <em>those</em> novels. Comparisons to
Kafka on the back cover. Lots of interior monologue from the
characters. Hopelessness enough to open a branch office. A dubious
salvation attained through the whim of fate and/or the embrace of
irrationality (with everything left "artistically" vague at the
denoument).</p>

<p>Kessel has obvious gifts as a prose stylist; I kept reading
looking for the next clever bit. On the macro level, though, the
book manages to be both boring and painful, an example of the sort
of facile "safe" satire that breathes outrage at the human
condition but in the end has no ethical solutions or even
worthwhile insights to offer.</p>

<p>Kessel isn't quite as far gone in the literatus-disease syndrome
as, say, Brian Aldiss (see <a href="RR00036.html">RR#36</a>); he's
still actually capable of generating interesting science-fictional
ideas (the Han virus and some aspects of his future society, for
example). The trouble is that these remain just clever bits, chrome
ornaments on a book that has a vacuum at its core.</p>

<p>Why vacuum? Because it pretends engagement but avoids ever
taking a stand -- indeed, its message is that any stance other than
a bemused embrace of one's own ineffectuality is futile. Logic is
poison. Faith has no power. Courage is a joke. Everybody is crazy,
but that's OK because only the idealistically anti-rational can
really know what's going on. No center is possible. The only thing
you can do is cling to the frightened monkey next to you and hope
the sky won't fall today.</p>

<p>If you're impressed by tricky prose, academic in-jokes and
pot-shots at easy targets, though, you'll have a good time. There's
one merciless reductio done on structuralism and its sequelae that
is <em>so</em> clever and savage and funny that I can almost
forgive its self-indulgence. It segues into a mocking parable of
failure at the end, though, and fails to connect with anything else
in the book.</p>

<p>I suppose I'd've found all this more interesting if I hadn't
read so many like it before. I wasn't at all surprised when I
flipped to the inside back cover and discovered that Kessel has a
PhD in English, because the book reads just like your typical
20th-century PhD-Lit's parochial notion of what "serious"
literature ought to be. What amazes me is that mainstream reviewers
and other writers keep falling for the same old cliched, dreary
nonsense. Readers certainly don't; they ignore this kind of thing
in droves.</p>

<p>Indeed, I think the saddest thing about <cite>Good News</cite>
is that it's a perfect reflection of contemporary literary values.
In the 20th-century mainstream this sort of thing is exactly what
passes for great art. And that is why English-language "serious"
literature today is in such sterile and desperate shape, why what
used to be its mass audience has fled to genre books and trash
"popfic". Ah, well. This, too, shall pass.</p>
