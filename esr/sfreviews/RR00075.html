<p>This novel is a prequel to <cite>Sassinak</cite> (<a
href="RR00021,html">RR#21</a>), set in Anne McCaffrey's "Dinosaur
Planet" universe. It is notable for two unusual traits. One is that
it's better written than its predecessor. Two is that the
back-cover blurb tells an outright lie about the plot.</p>

<p>Yes, it's true. The back cover blurb has poor Lunzie Mespill,
the heroine, forced into cold sleep of unanticipated length by a
pirate attack. This is not what happens in the text; instead,
Lunzie's long sleep is forced when the craft she's on plays
involuntary bumper cars in one of those famous flying-avalanche
asteroid belts so beloved of astronomically ignorant writers. One
big, wet raspberry to the editorial dept. at Baen. Have they sunk
so low that they don't even bother reading the books before they
blurb them? Sheesh!</p>

<p>The stupid bloody asteroid belt isn't the only howler in this
book, by the way. A throwaway line on page 60 reveals that the
computers of 2800 AD have fewer K per user of accessible store than
a low-end IBM PC today. Gonnngggg...</p>

<p>Oh well. Lunzie, expecting she'll have been rescued within
weeks, is more than a little shocked to discover that she's slipped
sixty-two years when awakened. The 14-year-old daughter she'd left
at home is in late middle age as their culture reckons such things
(typical lifespan is, we are told, c.120 standard years). Lunzie's
M.D. is obsolete. She is adrift in time.</p>

<p>The book begins the story of the new life she fashions for
herself, and how she gets involved with Fleet Intelligence and
enters the Great Game against the planet pirates. It's better than
<cite>Sassinak</cite> because it's focussed on a more believable
character, doing things it is easier to believe in context. The
prose takes time to build pictures, rather than hurling the reader
through a lot of thinly described action at warp speed.</p>

<p>And, yes, Lunzie does wind up on Ireta all set to hook up with
Sassinak. The next book will probably pick up where
<cite>Sassinak</cite> and <cite>The Death Of Sleep</cite> left off.
Maybe with a third collaborator?</p>

<p>Fans of McCaffrey or military/adventure SF might enjoy this
book. It hit my "To Sell" box at high velocity, but I'm heartened
at the improvement it represents over <cite>Sassinak</cite>. At
this rate the third book might actually be good enough to keep.</p>
