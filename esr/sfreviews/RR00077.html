<h1 class="c1">Raymond's Reviews #77</h1>

<p>I'm going to be doing <em>lots</em> of short takes for a while
to catch up with summer stuff that came out either during my August
vacation or the deadline crunch before it...</p>

<pre>
%T A Knight of Ghosts and Shadows
%A Mercedes Lackey &amp; Ellen Guyon
%I Baen
%D July 1990
%O paperback, US$4.95
%P 345
%G 0-671-69885-0
</pre>

<p>This amiable bit of fluff follows the adventures of a street
musician and Renaissance-faire habitue who discovers one day that
his flute-playing is a little too good -- good enough to get him
dangerously entangled with an enclave of Elves struggling to
survive the rigors of urban life in California. Melodrama, romance
and the odd bit of comedy ensue as he is called on to save the day.
Despite the male viewpoint character this book is clearly aimed at
female fantasy fans, and should please many of them.</p>

<pre>
%T Jaguar
%A Bill Ransom
%I Ace
%D July 1990
%O paperback, US$3.95
%P 294
%G 0-441-70353-4
</pre>

<p>This is a bizarre and original but not quite satisfying fantasy
by Frank Herbert's coauthor on the trashy bestseller <cite>The
Ascension Factor</cite>. The author doubtless thinks he wrote an SF
novel but the premise is incoherent and the appeal strictly
archetypal and `literary' rather than through logical coherence and
world-building detail. Resembles Herbert on a bad day, sententious
leadoff quotes for each chapter and all.</p>

<pre>
%T The Diamond Throne
%A David Eddings
%I Del Rey
%D July 1990
%O paperback, US$5.95
%P 435
%G 0-345-36769-3
</pre>

<p>Sigh. OK, I liked the <cite>Belgariad</cite>, but I found the
<cite>Malloreon</cite> unreadable and this new series has nothing
new to offer. Maybe Eddings is one of those sad cases with only one
good book in him. This is strictly predictable buckle-swashing as
the Queen's Champion in a medievaloid kingdom quests for the cure
to a sinister magical disease induced by scheming courtiers.
Yawn.</p>

<pre>
%T A Landscape of Darkness
%A John Blair
%I Ballantine/Del Rey
%D July 1990
%O paperback, US$3.95
%P 247
%G 0-345-36517-8
</pre>

<p>This cliche-ridden debut novel pits an interstellar mercenary
with an attitude against an alien immortal with a thirst for blood.
Actually, the writing and world-building is better than you'd
expect from that synopsis; Blair might actually produce something
interesting if he ever cooks up a more original premise.</p>

<p>NOT REVIEWED</p>

<p>The Dungeon #6 (Phillip Jose Farmer), Magic's Price (Mercedes
Lackey) More of those interminable fantaseries.</p>

<p>Starstrike (W. Michael Gear) The stench rising from the pages
was just too intense...</p>
