<h1 class="c1">Raymond's Reviews #78</h1>

<p>I'm going to be doing <em>lots</em> of short takes for a while
to catch up with summer stuff that came out either during my August
vacation or the deadline crunch before it...here are the July
releases I didn't get to before.</p>

<pre>
%T Kaduna Memories
%A Jack McKinney
%I Ballantine/Del Rey
%D July 1990
%O paperback, US$4.95
%P 249
%G 0-345-36579
</pre>

<p>An enjoyable if lightweight space opera with a bit of cyberpunk
flavoring. A poor little rich girl hires small-time data-detective
Felix McTurk to take on her guardian's megacorporation, seeking the
truth about the death of her parents years before. And McTurk has
his own grudges against Offworld Lifting and Development. What
neither knows is that OLD's secret is First Contact...and that
they'll kill to keep it. Quirky characters give this book most of
its charm, though the AIs seem excessively humanlike.</p>

<pre>
%T A Key for the Nonesuch
%A Geary Gravel
%I Ballantine/Del Rey
%D July 1990
%O paperback, US$3.95
%P 229
%G 0-345-35976-3
</pre>

<p>Geary Gravel's earlier novels <cite>The Alchemists</cite> and
<cite>The Pathfinders</cite> were ambitious, spectacular,
philosophically involved constructions displaying lyric gifts
reminiscent of Cordwainer Smith. With this one he seems to have set
his sights lower, aiming at the SF/adventure market and producing
something that rather recalls Jack Chalker's Well of Souls books.
The result is certainly better executed than Chalker and pleasant
enough on its own terms, but a bit of a disappointment otherwise;
the gorgeousness and challenge of the earlier books is missing. And
it appears that we're being set up for a series. Oh well. Buy it
anyhow; keep Gravel writing. The chance that he might regain his
earlier form is well worth it...</p>

<pre>
%T Soft and Others
%A F. Paul Wilson
%I TOR
%D July 1990
%O paperback, US$4.95
%P 306
%G 0-812-50375-9
</pre>

<p>I can only review about half of this anthology, as I strongly
dislike horror fiction and generally refuse to read it. The SF,
however, is excellent, including the now-classic
<cite>Lipidleggin'</cite> and <cite>To Fill The Sea And Air</cite>.
Wilson's range and originality are impressive, even if his work
does tend to an unfinished quality that suggests he still has some
growing to do as a writer (often, the story sirtuations are too
obviously set-pieces for a particular effect or moral and leave too
little sense of connection to a wider reality). He seems to have
intended this collection as a set of his journeyman pieces, and
it's well worth having as a chronicle of authorial growth,
especially if you like horror fiction.</p>

<p>RECEIVED BUT NOT REVIEWED:</p>

<p>The Hammer of the Sun (Michael Scott Rohan), Songs of the
Dancing Gods (Jack Chalker). More ho-hum fantasy series books.</p>

<p>The Sand Wars #6: Challenge Met (Charles Ingrid). Low-rent space
opera. "Jack Storm faces an impossible mission into the heart of
enemy territory." Sheesh.</p>
