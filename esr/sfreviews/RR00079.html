<p>More catch-up...August releases start here</p>

<pre>
%T Annual World's Best SF
%A Donald A. Wollheim
%I DAW
%D August 1990
%O paperback, US$4.50
%P 341
%G 0-88677-424-1
</pre>

<p>This year, it's not. It leads off with a short-story length
retread of Gregory Benford's <cite>Great Sky River</cite> and
continues with far too many pretentious `message' stories -- some
of which (like Lisa Tuttle's <cite>In Translation</cite> and Brian
Aldiss's <cite>North Of The Abyss</cite>) completely collapse under
their load of significance. The brightest spot is perhaps Orson
Scott Card's <cite>Dogwalker</cite>, followed closely by Judith
Moffett's <cite>Not Without Honor</cite>, Barrington J. Bailey's
bizarre <cite>Death Ship</cite> and a couple of slick pieces by
Robert Silverberg. There's enough here to make the book worth
buying, but 'ware turkeys.</p>

<pre>
%T Silent Dances
%A A. C. Cripin and Kathleen O'Malley
%I Ace
%D July 1990
%O paperback, US$3.95
%P 275
%G 0-441-78330-9
</pre>

<p>Book Two in the `Starbridge' series demonstrates once again that
earnest novels with uplifting politically correct subtexts about
special people from minorities tend to collapse under the weight of
their own good intentions. The premise for the series -- that it's
the chronicles of an academy for young first-contact specialists --
could have been made into some excellent and <em>subtle</em>
young-adult novels. Instead, in this, we get affirmative-action
preachiness (the protagonist is -- get this -- a deaf Amerind
woman) unredeemed by much in the way of real ethical challenge or
innovative world-building or even un-obvious plot twists. How
special.</p>

<pre>
%T The Interior Life
%A Katherine Blake
%I Baen
%D Aug 1990
%O paperback, US$3.95
%P 313
%G 0-671-72010-4
</pre>

<p>Another lone-woman-against-the-Dark fantasy -- but in this one
the Dark has an ecology and a psychological dimension absent from
most such. Housewife Sue finds she is living two lives which
interpenetrate in odd ways, one of them in a magic-using fantasy
world where she is the earthy handmaiden of a great sorceress.
Remarkable characterization and an understated message about the
possibilities of personal growth make this a far better novel than
most of its ilk.</p>

<pre>
%T TekWar
%A William Shatner
%I Ace
%D Aug 1990
%O paperback, US$4.50
%P 307
%G 0-441-80208-7
</pre>

<p>The man who was Kirk gives us a competent but undistinguished SF
thriller. Jake Cardigan, a cop in future California framed for
dealing the addictive brain stimulant `Tek', is sprung early to
take on a special case with a buddy who's gone private. It's his
chance to nail the man who sent him to the slammer, if he lives.
The best things about this novel are the unexpected touches of
humor and odd detail in it; the scene where a Hollywood parasite's
holo-projected house disappears behind him because he's failed to
keep up the payments is particularly nice. Pick it up used.</p>
