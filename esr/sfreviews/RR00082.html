<h1 class="c1">Raymond's Reviews #82</h1>

<p>More catch-up...finishing the August releases</p>

<pre>
%T Metrognome
%A Alan Dean Foster
%I Ballantine/DelRey
%D August 1990
%O paperback, US$4.95
%P 243
%G 0-345-36356-6
</pre>

<p>A mixed bag of SF, horror and fantasy reprints by Alan Dean
Foster from the magazines and various previous anthologies. I
didn't find it as good as his earlier <cite>With Friends Like
These</cite> and <cite>Who Needs Enemies</cite>. Too much horror,
for one thing (but that could be just me) and too many slight
pieces that read like finger exercises on fairly obvious gimmicks.
For Foster completists only.</p>

<pre>
%T The Man-Kzin Wars III
%A Niven/Pournelle/Stirling/Anderson
%I Baen
%D August 1990
%O paperback, US$4.50
%P 310
%G 0-671-72008-2
</pre>

<p>More hard-SF writers romping in Niven's `Known Space' -- with
(mirabile dictu) a new Known-Space lead story from Niven himself!
The second story is a collaboration between Jerry Pournelle and
rising star S. M. Stirling. It gives us our best look yet at Slaver
psychology, presenting them as sinister clowns so specialized on
their mental coercive powers that they're not even very bright.
Anderson provides a satisfying finish with the further adventures
of Hans Saxtorph against the Kzin. Fun stuff for Known-Space fans
and anybody who likes traditional adventure &amp; military hard SF.
Recommended.</p>

<pre>
%T The Warlock Rock
%A Christopher Stasheff
%I Ace
%D August 1990
%O paperback, US$3.95
%P 275
%G 0-441-87313-8
</pre>

<p>There are few ordeals more teeth-gritting for a reviewer than
reading the nth volume of a series that has clearly outlasted its
original magic and is transparently being milked for bucks by an
author writing successively tireder self-parodies. Stasheff reached
that point with the Warlock books some time back. The most this one
has going for it is a raft of groaner puns about rock music, and
even those are smothered under several tons of gooey cutesiness. If
you liked the first couple Warlock books as much as I did, do
yourself a favor and don't read this one.</p>

<pre>
%T The Stone Dogs
%A S. M. Stirling
%I Baen
%D August 1990
%O paperback, US$4.50
%P 522
%G 0-671-72009-0
</pre>

<p>As good and gripping as S. M. Stirling has been in the first two
Draka novels (<cite>Marching Through Georgia</cite> and <cite>Under
The Yoke</cite>) this one comes as a bit of a disappointment. The
final confrontation between the slaveholding Draka and the Alliance
for Democracy is weakly plotted and the ending is disappointing --
that is, we <em>don't</em> get to see the Draka nuked into a thin
glaze as they so richly deserve. One gets the uncomfortable feeling
Stirling is setting up for another sequel. Oh, well. The
world-building is still top-notch and the book worth a read to find
out how it all came out.</p>

<p>RECEIVED BUT NOT REVIEWED:</p>

<p>The Folk Of The Fringe (Orson Scott Card) Sorry, I couldn't face
another dose of Card's confused religiosity and obsession with his
Mormon origins.</p>
