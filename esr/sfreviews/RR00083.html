<p>I've just read my first issue of NYRSF. I thought it was
hilarious and sad.</p>

<p>Most of the content in at least this issue displays a syndrome
that has vitiated 20th-century "serious" literature and literary
criticism, and driven most SF fans to reject both. That is, it is
no longer "about" anything; like the Oozelum Bird, it has flown up
its own arsehole into a precious never-never land of commentaries
on reflections on ever finer-spun theories of what its proper
subject matter is.</p>

<p>Samuel Delany's lead article is a perfect example of how the rot
sets in. It's not about SF; it's about <em>the process of writing
SF</em>, and includes a good deal of encouragement to
self-satisfaction over SF's claim to be "the perfect post-modernist
art-form" -- but if the <em>readers</em> of SF (the persons to whom
writerly communication is ostensibly directed) have anything but
indifference or contempt for such "programs" I've yet to hear of
it. There is nothing in the article that addresses a reader's needs
or interests at all; it's for initiates only, directed at an elite
that has replaced reading with hermeneutics, and implicitly
encouraged writers to disdain honest storytelling in favor of this
week's version of "higher values" and a precious, self-conscious
artiness.</p>

<p>The article displays critical regress -- the retreat from
talking about a subject to talking about talking about a subject,
then to talking about talking about talking about a subject, and so
on until the ostensible subject evaporates, almost unnoticed. When
the content of an art form is primarily shaped by such critical
regresses, the loop is closed and the whole mass of "art objects"
and texts about them disappears into a black hole of irrelevance.
This is what happened to "modern" art, architecture, avant-garde
music, and "serious literature" after WWI; the writers for NYRSF
seem to be engaged in doing it to SF as well.</p>

<p>Tacitus might have said "They make a desert and call it
postmodernism". I could write a whole essay on the parochialism
implicit in the postmodernist idea of "exhaustion", which requires
that the reader have the same experience as the
critically-regressed writer contemplating the texts of other
critically-regressed writers -- but that's for another time.</p>

<p>Fer cripes' sake. Doesn't anybody notice something wrong (or at
least misdirected) about a 24-page journal called "The New York
Review of Science Fiction" in which there are only three reviews,
two of books which can be called SF only by an extremely loose
reading of the term? In which nearly one third of the pagecount is
given over to multiple arguments over a debate about someone else's
alleged theory of how SF ought to be written? And in which appear
not just one but <em>two</em> utterly irrelevant excerpts from
"Rock and Roll: the 100 Best Singles". <em>Where has the subject
gone?</em></p>

<p>To be fair, there are one or two articles that haven't entirely
forgotten a subject; Kathryn Cramer's on "Literary Architecture"
and Greg Cox's "Reader's Guide to Vampire Fiction". Both, though,
are about horror -- about a genre which encourages subjectivity and
psychologizing. One senses that this is friendlier ground for the
"literary" and critical mind than SF precisely because it has less
grounding in the external reality of the reader, and is thus more
easily manipulated to critical ends.</p>

<p>In general, though, the writing is self-important, terminally
inbred, and light- years removed from any concerns a reader trying
to better understand the actual texts of SF might have. Can't the
field do any better than this?</p>
