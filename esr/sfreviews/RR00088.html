<pre>
%T The Fifth Book of Lost Swords: Coinspinner's Story
%A Fred Saberhagen
%I TOR Fantasy
%D September 1990
%O paperback, US$4.50
%P 245
%G 0-812-55286-5
</pre>

<p>Regular readers of this column will know that I am no great fan
of the interminable formula-fantasy series that clog chain-store
bookshelves everywhere, and might wonder why I'm bothering with any
book with a title like this one. Well, the simple fact is that I
think Fred Saberhagen writes a damn good story. The lucid clarity
of his prose, sinewy plotting and vividly-realized details of his
worlds make for dependable entertainment every time. Not for
Saberhagen the demonized archetypal villains, over-ornate styling
and flat characters of so many of his competitors; everything in
his milieux has a depth and solidity that breathes new life into
what ought to be the most formulaic ideas. Enjoy! -- but 'ware the
set-up for the next book at the end.</p>

<pre>
%T Wild Card's VII: Dead Man's Hand
%A George R. R. Martin &amp; John J. Miller
%I Bantam Spectra
%D September 1990
%O paperback, US$4.50
%P 328
%G 0-553-28569-6
</pre>

<p>Despite its grand-guignol excesses, the <cite>Wild Cards</cite>
books are still the best shared-world series I've read anything of.
This novel interlocks with Book VI, as Popinjay and the Yeoman team
up to solve the brutal murder of Chrysalis. In the ensuing mayhem,
one truly major badguy bites the dust -- but the identity and
motive of the murderer is the real surprise.</p>

<pre>
%T Enemy Unseen (Star Trek #51)
%A V. E. Mitchell
%I Pocket Books
%D September 1990
%O paperback, US$4.50
%P 279
%G 0-671-68403-5
</pre>

<p>Well, Mitchell isn't Diane Duane but this particular bit of
trekfic is a big improvement on the last one I reviewed (<a
href="RR00086.html">RR#86</a>) -- it's at least not embarrassingly
bad. A routine diplomatic mission goes awry as Kirk must deal with
a conniving ex-girlfriend and an alien shapeshifter, both bent on
disrupting negotiations. A pleasant, lightweight read-once for
trekfans.</p>

<pre>
%T The Whole Man
%A John Brunner
%I: Collier Nucleus
%O paperback, US$4.95
%P 188
%G 0-02-030275-4
</pre>

<p>This reprint of Brunner's groundbreaking 1964 novel has dated
not at all; indeed, his portrayal of a world of local uprisings and
low-intensity wars pacified by multinational forces of U.N. troops
seems more plausible in today's post-perestroika world than it
could have at the height of the Cold War. He gives us the story of
the crippled perojective telepath Gerald Howson. He begins life as
an orphaned hemophiliac leading a cheerless and impoverished
existence, relieved only by his fantasies of becoming one of the
U.N.'s idealized telepathist heroes. When the fantasy comes true he
plunges himself into the work of healing diseased minds; but his
own inner conflict remains unresolved, and he is tempted to retreat
into a world of fantasies reflected off the minds of others. He
eventually finds a chance for wholeness through the creation of a
new art form, in a resolution which stirs as much for its
affirmation of the moral value of human creativity as for the
prospect of a happy ending. Treat yourself to this one!</p>
