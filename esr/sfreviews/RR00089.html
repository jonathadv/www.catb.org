<pre>
%T Down the Stream of Stars
%A Jeffrey A. Carver
%I Bantam Spectra
%D September 1990
%O paperback, US$4.95
%P 355
%G 0-553-28302-2
</pre>

<p>This sequel to <cite>From A Changeling Star</cite> has less
imaginative reach but, unfortunately, the same pulpy overwritten
feel. This is a shame, as some of Carver's speculations about the
impact of very advanced "virtual reality" computer interfaces and
nanotechnology were quite interesting. But those aren't followed
up; instead we get yet another cute-little-girl-and-her-
fuzzy-animal-friend-save-the-starship novel. This might succeed as
a juvenile, but doesn't seem to be aimed that way.</p>

<pre>
%T Polar City Blues
%A Katherine Kerr
%I Bantam Spectra
%D September 1990
%O paperback, US$4.50
%P 262
%G 0-553-28504-1
</pre>

<p>This first SF novel by the author of <cite>Darkspell</cite>,
<cite>Daggerspell</cite>, and <cite>The Bristling Wood</cite> (see
<a href="RR00074.html">RR#74</a>) is a treat. The viewpoint
characters are a cop and his smuggler friend investigating a murder
on the streets of Polar City, capitol of a human republic
sandwiched precariously between two rather nasty alien-dominated
empires. The victim, it begins to seem, was out spying for one, and
quite possibly killed by a psionic assassin from the other; the
incident could start a shooting war that could grind the republic
into dust. But there are other, wierder things going on, too;
someone's found the body of one of an unknown species of alien
buried with a mysterious artifact in a shantytown, and is spreading
a weird plague in the city. Somehow, this ties in with the murder
-- and, perhaps, the only hope of avoiding utter destruction.
There's a fine knotty puzzle here, set up in classic
thriller/mystery style and lent extra flavor by the SF setting.
Also, feminists will enjoy the neat reversal of expected roles in
the book's romantic subplot. Recommended.</p>

<pre>
%T Shadowspeer
%A Jo Clayton
%I DAW
%D September 1990
%O paperback, US$4.95
%P 342
%G 0-88677-441-1
</pre>

<p>This sequel to Shadowplay (<a href="RR00048.html">RR#48</a>)
shares its virtues (evocative worldbuilding, sensuous and energetic
prose) and its faults (a fairly predictable plot). Shadith and her
friends, tracking Ginbiryol Seyirshi, land on the world of Chissoku
Bogmak with a plan to kidnap one of the clients for his genocidal
"Special Editions" and use their depraved victim to backtrack to
the master himself. Needless to say, not all goes according to plan
-- because their victim has been warned. Fun stuff, lots of
derring-do and twisty plotting. Recommended, but with the caveat
that it ends on a cliffhanger for book 3.</p>

<p>RECEIVED BUT NOT REVIEWED:</p>

<p>Once again, a glut of fantasy followups -- this time including
<cite>Dare To Go A Hunting</cite>, the sequel to <cite>Flight In
Yiktor</cite> by Andre Norton, and <cite>Mossflower</cite>, the
prequel to <cite>Redwall</cite> by Brian Jacques. The latter looks
on a casual flip-through as though it might have some redeeming
social value, especially for kids; but so much stuff came in that I
don't have time to read it and do a review.</p>
