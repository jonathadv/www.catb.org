<p>A. A. Attanasio's latest book, last of a loosely connected set
called the `Radix Tetrad', is a brilliant, epic novel that falls
frustratingly short of being an SF masterpiece.</p>

<p>Two billion years after Sol went nova, an entity called the
Rimstalker builds a solar system and stocks it with the recreated
humans and plants and animals of the many eras of lost Earth. The
eight bright worlds that circle the sun-machine Lod and the seven
twilit satellites of the black hole Saor are webbed together by
`lynks', hyperspatial transit tubes. The whole is designed as bait
for the zotl, spiderlike enemies of the Rimstalker who feed on
pain. Against this weird background, baroque and intricate human
cultures rise and fall; individuals seek their various destinies;
and a few -- a very few -- seek to transcend the limits placed on
them by the conflicts of the gods.</p>

<p>Sounds promising, right? And the writing is gorgeous, too. The
trouble with this novel is that Attanasio isn't an SF writer in the
most important sense -- he lacks either the knowledge or the
motivation necessary to make his world internally consistent and
logically convincing. What scientific rationalization there is in
the book is annoyingly superficial, and often seems to be there
more there for its word-poetry effect than because it's
structurally important.</p>

<p>The results are a peculiarly jarring mixture of lyricism and
transparent doubletalk. We are told, for example, that the zotl
feed on "pain androgens" -- but with no explanation of why such an
advanced species doesn't simply synthesize them in ton lots rather
than going to the expense and risk of preying on other sentients.
The Rimstalker's homeworld is represented as a ribbon-shaped
`range' just outside a black-hole remnant of the primordial
monobloc, existing in a higher energy regime that unifies the four
fources into `magravity', and yet we are told that the Rimstalker
grew up on a farm and is roughly humanoid (down to such details as
having fingers!). And these are just two of the more glaring
bloopers!</p>

<p>Attanasio has a fine mythopoeic imagination, all right, but what
he's done is lousy SF. What's frustrating is that the problems
could have been fixed with only minor changes to the real matter of
the novel and no lessening of its good qualities. With a close
critical reading by a hard-SF-oriented author or editor before
publication and a little flexibility on the author's part, this
could have been a major work comparable in many ways to Dan
Simmons's Hugo-winning <cite>Hyperion</cite>, or James Morrows's
<cite>The Continent Of Lies</cite>, or David Zindell's
<cite>Neverness</cite>.</p>

<p>As it is, the result is irritatingly flawed from any genre fan's
point of view. The scientifically ignorant will love it, though,
and it might be a good book to hand those humanities types who've
been told SF is all formulaic, badly written crap.</p>

<p>Finally, I must say that even though Attanasio bears authorial
responsibility and thus the primary fault, I think some editor at
Bantam deserves a serious rebuke for not having arranged the
"reality check" this book needed. Sloppy science may not be worth
the effort to see corrected in a book that's another novelfull of
genre yardage -- but this one could have been so much more for so
little effort.</p>
