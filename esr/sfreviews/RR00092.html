<h1 class="c1">Raymond's Reviews #92</h1>

<p>Finishing off the September catchup...</p>

<pre>
%T Knight of Shadows
%A Roger Zelazny
%I Avon
%D September 1990
%O paperback, US$3.95
%G 0-380-75501-7
</pre>

<p>And it's grind, clank, grind as Zelazny churns out another
volume in a series that should have been left to expire peacefully
five years ago. Not that the first four Amber books weren't a lot
of fun in their way; I liked them. The trouble is Zelazny keeps
changing the rules, or maybe can't decide what they are. The effect
is a lot like one of the old Doc Smith space operas, where you get
pseudo-resolutions followed by some character wheeling in a whole
new set of physical laws and restarting the same old fireworks at a
higher level. After three or four rounds of this one's sense of
wonder starts to flag, unavoidably. So with Zelazny. Out of plot
twists? Fine -- introduce another unexplained super-artifact or
level of pseudo- metaphysical complication to your fantasy and have
at it. Internal consistency? Economy of concept? What's that you
say? Confirmed Amber fans will enjoy; anyone who hasn't read the
previous books will be bewildered; I was bored.</p>

<pre>
%T Revenge of the Fluffy Bunnies
%A Craig Shaw Gardner
%I Ace
%D September 1990
%O paperback, US$4.95
%P 216
%G 0-441-71833-7
</pre>

<p>This, following "Slaves of the Volcano God" and "Bride of the
Slime Monster", finishes off "The Cineverse Cycle". It's more of
the sort of camp humor and gleefully cliche-ridden slapstick
readers of the earlier books will expect, sort of a fantasy
equivalent of the immortal "50 Worst Movies Of All Time". Can Roger
Gordon, in his new identity as Captain Crusader, defeat the minions
of the infamous Doctor Dread and reverse the Change that has
villains winning and entertainment losing all over the Cineverse?
Will he ever extricate his beloved Delores from the nauseating
clutches of Edward the Slime Monster? And what about Dwight the
Wonder Dog? Read this to find out. I enjoyed it, but the prose was
definitely heavy-handed and the ending kind of flat. Others less
willing to forgive poor writing in the service of high camp might
find it irredeemably lame.</p>

<pre>
%T Lord Conrad's Lady
%A Leo Frankowski
%I Ballantine/Del Rey
%D September 1990
%O paperback, US$4.95
%P 296
%G 0-345-36849-5
</pre>

<p>With this book Frankowski's Crosstime Engineer series finally
lurches to a close. Most of the author's effort in this one seems
to have gone to rescuing himself from the charge of unbelievably
regressive sexism justified by the other four books. He doesn't
succeed, and the series as a whole is going to offend the crap out
of anyone who dislikes seeing women treated as disposable sexual
conveniences. But the engineering bits are so interesting, dammit!
I'm glad I get these free and don't have to reward him for them,
though...</p>

<p>BOOKS RECEIVED BUT NOT REVIEWED:</p>

<p>"The Boy From The Burren" by Sheila Gilluly; "Night-Threads" by
Ru Emerson, "Ther Fire's Stone" by Tanya Huff. Two first-of-series
fantasies and one of the all-too-rare standalones. All three look
formulaic and boring.</p>

<p>"Tarzan of The Apes", by Edgar Rice Burroughs. Another reissue.
That's OK.</p>

<p>"Singularities" by W.T. Quick. SF, but...too many sequels, too
little time.</p>
