<p>During the 1970s, Marion Zimmer Bradley wrote a number of novels
about a planet called Darkover. The Darkover novels fused old
science fiction themes (exploration party goes native on uncharted
planet and spawns a new culture) with old sword-and- sorcery themes
(magic users control a Celtic-flavored feudal culture) to create an
oddly plausible and (to many) extremely appealing hybrid.</p>

<p>But this fusion of cliches was not what made the Darkover novels
interesting. What gave the Darkover novels real depth and interest
for readers was not the flashiness of the gimmicks they used, but
the psychological and ethical issues they posed. Bradley took us
inside Darkovan society by taking us inside the heads of the nobles
who ran it, the women who suffered from its restrictions, and the
Terranans, who attempted by turns to control and to understand it.
She forced us to consider what kinds of choices might be faced by
individuals in a telepathic society.</p>

<p>"The Heirs of Hammerfell" is the first Darkover novel Marion has
published in five years. Unfortunately, it was not worth the wait.
The characters are crudely sketched, and the plot feels thin, as
though Bradley were awkwardly padding a short story into novel
length.</p>

<p>Worst of all, the novel lacks the ethical depth of the earlier
novels. The one potential ethical conflict -- whether the younger
of the Duke of Hammerfell's twin sons should accede to the
authority of the elder even if he believes he would be a better
Duke -- is resolved with little real soul searching and
unbelievable rapidity.</p>

<p>In short, "Hammerfell" is a crude parody of the formula that
made the Darkover novels popular. Marion, how could you?</p>
