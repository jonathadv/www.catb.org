<h1 class="c1">Raymond's Reviews #099</h1>

<p>I've been busy with my <em>own</em> book for months now, but I'm
finally out from under and Raymond's Reviews will start appearing
regularly once again -- but mostly short takes until I catch up.
This is December releases #1.</p>

<pre>
%T Voyage of the Star Wolf
%A David Gerrold
%I Bantam Spectra
%D November 1991
%O paperback, US$4.50
%P 276
%G 0-553-26466-4
</pre>

<p>You won't believe this novel for a second, but you may enjoy it
anyhow. Gerrold mixes old-fashioned space opera with New Age
psychobabble, adds a healthy dose of SFnal in-jokes and punning
references, and the result is a bizarre but zesty concoction that's
either the stupidest novel of his career or a colossal joke.
<em>You</em> be the judge...</p>

<pre>
%T Christmas on Ganymede
%A Martin H. Greenberg (ed.)
%I Avon
%D December 1990
%O paperback, US$3.50
%P 243
%G 0-380-76203-X
</pre>

<p>This theme anthology of Christmas stories is decidedly uneven.
There's good new stuff by Michael Swanwick and Gene Wolfe and good
old stuff by Poul Anderson and Gordon Dickson, but also a couple of
items of new-Wavish unpleasantness by Jack McDevitt and Connie
Willis and Barry Malzberg, and a lot of so-so older material from
the magazines. Overall I wouldn't recommend paying cover price for
it, but if you're curious about the variety of approaches SF has
taken to a mythos that doesn't connect to it very well you might
want to pick it up used.</p>

<pre>
%T Chronosequence
%A Hilbert Schenk
%I TOR
%D December 1990
%O paperback, US$3.95
%P 314
%G 0-812-50320-1
</pre>

<p>Hilbert Schenk is a strange but gifted writer, a sort of SFnal
Herman Mellvile who continually reworks the matter of his
obsessions into weird but gripping narratives. His obsessions? The
sea, as seen by the seafarers of New England. Sacred places. The
power of memory. Mysticism. Sex. Transcendence. And here they are
again in a tale of contact with an alien Visitor awaiting an
unguessable destiny beneath the wave-wracked sand of Muskeget
Island. The result is like new changes rung on a familiar carillon
-- never greatly surprising, but rewarding in its own weird
way.</p>

<pre>
%T Crystal Express
%A Bruce Sterling
%I Berkeley/Ace
%D December 1990
%O paperback, US$4.50
%P 278
%G 0-441-12423-2
</pre>

<p>This is an anthology of short stories first published in the
magazines between '84 and '87. Seriously good and brain-bending
stuff by the high priest and propagandist of cyberpunk. Enjoy.</p>
