<h1 class="c1">Raymond's Reviews #100</h1>

<p>I've been busy with my <em>own</em> book for months now, but I'm
finally out from under and Raymond's Reviews will start appearing
regularly once again -- but mostly short takes until I catch up.
This is December releases #2.</p>

<pre>
%T Secrets of Power I: Never Deal with a Dragon
%A Robert M. Charrette
%I ROC
%D December 1990
%O paperback, US$4.95
%P 377
%G 0-451-45078-7
</pre>

<p>This novelization set in the universe of FASA's `Shadowrun'
role-playing game ought to have been complete and irredeemable
crap, as such spinoffs usually are. It isn't, which is both a
pleasant surprise and no small comment on Robert Charrette's
ability as a writer. The characters are well enough drawn and the
world sufficiently interesting to raise it at least to the level of
decent pulp fiction. Kick back with a tall cool one and enjoy.</p>

<pre>
%T A Man of his Word part I: The Magic Casement
%A Dave Duncan
%I DelRey
%D December 1990
%O paperback, US$4.95
%P 307
%G 0-345-36628-X
</pre>

<p>Dave Duncan proves yet again that, yes, a retired petroleum
geologist in his 50s <em>can</em> write rings around most of the
earnest young humanities majors who think they've got Life As A
Writer planned before they've seen any of it. This book is
original, affecting, and <em>wise</em>. Buy it and enjoy.</p>

<pre>
%T Clarke County, Space
%A Allen Steele
%I Berkeley/Ace
%D December 1990
%O paperback, US$4.50
%P 231
%G 0-441-11044-4
</pre>

<p>This book has some good moments, but not nearly enough of them.
The predictable intrigue-and-terrorism-on-the-High-Frontier plot
isn't quite redeemed by the writing (competent) the characters
(including one marvelous study of an obsessive Jewish assassin who
calls himself The Golem) or the jokes (there are some decent bits
about the "Church of Elvis"). Oh well, maybe he'll do better next
time.</p>

<pre>
%T Zone Yellow
%A Keith Laumer
%I Baen Books
%D December 1990
%O paperback, US$4.50
%P 247
%G 0-671-72028-7
</pre>

<p>Keith Laumer has produced some good work in the past, but this
book is wretched, boring crap. Time Agent Brion Bayard takes on a
race of sentient but conveniently stupid rat-men. Ooo. They eat
people. Ooo. Can he save the Multiverse? Ooo. How hard can I bounce
this off the wall?</p>
