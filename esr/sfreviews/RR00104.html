<p>Readers sophisticated enough to appreciate hard science fiction
in new and unusual guises will be fascinated and impressed by "The
Wall Around Eden," Slonczewski's latest addition to the
subgenre.</p>

<p>Slonczewski's book features a post-Holocaust world in which
small enclaves of humans have been saved from death-by-nuclear-
winter by aliens who have enclosed certain settlements in force
bubbles they cannot leave. The enclosures protect the humans from
the worst extremes of temperature and radiation, and the aliens
implement limited communication and barter among the enclaves, but
otherwise the survivors must deal with the effects of limited food
and medicine, and prolonged exposure to excess radiation, as best
they can.</p>

<p>The novel opens, twenty years after the Death Year (as the
survivors call it) in a small enclave that was once the rural town
of Gywnwood, Pennsylvania. Gywnwood's inhabitants believe that the
worst extremes of radiation outside the bubble has abated. They
long to be free to rejoin the rest of humanity, begin rebuilding
the civilization the bombs ended, and -- most importantly -- to
save themselves from inevitable extinction by radiation-induced
disease and infertility.</p>

<p>The plot turns on the moral choices faced by various Gywnwood
inhabitants who attempt to breach the wall. Slonczewski could
easily have used this premise as the springboard for yet another
veiled attack of technology as intrinsically evil, and the words
and conduct of some of the characters appear to support this view.
But she does not stop there. The Gywnwoodians ultimately achieve
their goal of escaping Eden, in true scientific fashion, by
investigating their "keepers," <em>and increasing their knowledge
about how those creatures function</em>. Moreover, this triumph is
achieved nonviolently -- despite substantial ambivalence in the
book as to whether the use of force, of any kind, can ever be
morally unjustified.</p>

<p><cite>The Wall Around Eden</cite> deserves kudos for many
reasons: for being pro-science and pro-knowledge, despite obvious
temptation to stack the deck against this view; for presenting
complex moral issues in a believable context; for refusing to do
the reader's thinking by neatly resolving those moral issues; and
for creating characters the reader is not ashamed to care about.
The reader will have to judge whether these depths outweigh the
slowness and awkwardness of the "plot," and whether the result is
Hugo material.</p>
