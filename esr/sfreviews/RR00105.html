<p>Judith Tarr's "Alamut," which returns us to the world of her
"Hound and Falcon" trilogy, epitomizes both the strengths and
weaknesses of her writing.</p>

<p>On the positive side (as she takes pains to tell us, in a
postscript), Tarr has researched the period of the Crusades and
used her research to create a plausible medieval Middle East for
the characters to inhabit. As in all of Tarr's novels, the
characters are lovingly imagined, meticulously described, and made
sympathetic through our empathy with the genuine moral dilemmas
they must resolve. The problem with Tarr's work is harder to
describe. Despite the fascination of its characters, "Alamut" is
not a gripping read. Why? Because the only tension in the novel
arises from personal relationships between different individual
characters. Will immortal Aidan accept the love of the infidel and
Assassin, Morgiana, despite his vow to avenge his kinsmen? Will
Morgiana forsake her master for Aidan? Will Joanna return to her
dour noble husband? Will Sayyida and her husband mend their
differences? Once you know the answers to these questions, "Alamut"
holds no further surprises, and that is regrettable.</p>

<p>A novelist must depict characters that feel "real" to hold the
reader's interest. But "real" characters, standing alone, are
simply not sufficient to hold a reader's attention throughout a
novel's 200-odd or 300-odd pages. The reader also needs to see
those characters act in their world and gain a picture of their
efforts to achieve ALL of their goals, not merely those that are
integral to their relationships with other characters.</p>

<p>This "context gap" is the main problem with "Alamut." We have no
context for the parts of the characters' lives that bear on their
politics, their personal and social survival, and Tarr refrains
from supplying such context even where doing so would be natural.
For example, we see Joanna in the harem among her mother's kin,
observing the cloistered Arab women gathering political information
and subtly using that information to manipulate their husbands'
political decisions. But these scenes give us no information about
the political climate with which Joanna was supposedly born to
deal. Instead, we see this process only insofar as it enables
Joanna to assist Aidan and to meet him in secret, further fostering
the illusion that nothing is important to these people -- except
for their relationship to each other.</p>

<p>Tarr should re-read "Les Miserables," or a similar classic, to
learn how much drama a writer can generate by addressing the
mundane context of her characters' lives. Unless she gains such
perspective, she will undoubtedly continue to write dull novels
packed with dramatic scenes between interesting people.</p>
