<p>"Sugar Rain," like "Soldiers of Paradise," the first novel in
Park's Starbridge Chronicles series, seems at first blush to have
the necessary components -- exotic customs, religious fanaticism,
war, revolution in the streets -- for a successful science fiction
epic similar to Frank Herbert's "Dune." Yet he does not achieve
such success. Why?</p>

<p>The first and primary reason is Park's apparent inability to
communicate sufficient background information to the reader. Park
is competent, even gifted, at painting individual scenes for the
reader's inner eye, but he stumbles over the task of giving the
reader enough background about the planet and culture to make these
scenes comprehensible. Park complicates this task further by
focussing on characters who, for assorted religious and cultural
reasons, are culturally incapable of introspection, and thus are
almost useless for illuminating recent or distant history for the
reader.</p>

<p>The second reason is that those factual details that Park does
manage to communicate about the planet are implausible. The story
takes place on a desert planet with an 80,000-day year. For half
the year, nothing grows. Life is reactivated by a seasonal form of
precipitation that tastes sweet, yet leaves a flammable residue.
While the ability of periodic rain to make a temporary paradise of
a desert is well-known, it strains credulity to suggest that
flammable rain can engender enough food to feed even a small
population for 80,000 days, even if the inhabitants are capable of
creating some purely synthetic foods. Park's tidbits of planetary
history, which suggest that humans have somehow managed to live on
this wretched dirtball for thousands of (Earth) years or more,
further strain the reader's credulity.</p>

<p>Finally, the combination of the characters' lack of
introspection and the brutality of the culture discernible between
the lines of Park's finely crafted prose undermines the reader's
interest. After reading a relatively small number of pages, it
becomes clear that life is nasty and degrading, even for the noble
Starbridges, in Park's city-state of Charn. Park gives the reader
no reason to care about any of his characters, who surge blindly
forward like lemmings, apparently incapable of undertaking even the
smallest rational action to improve their lot. Park should be
commended for attempting a unique story about a unique culture. His
attempt, though a failure, is a brilliant one, and readers of
"Sugar Rain" will devoutly hope that he learns from it.</p>
