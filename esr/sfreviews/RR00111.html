<h1 class="c1">Raymond's Reviews #111</h1>

<p>I've been busy with my <em>own</em> book for months now, but I'm
finally out from under and Raymond's Reviews will start appearing
regularly once again -- but mostly short takes until I catch up.
This is February releases #2.</p>

<pre>
%T The Harp of the Grey Rose
%A Charles deLint
%I Avon Fantasy
%D February 1991
%O paperback, US$3.95
%P 230
%G 0-380-76202-1
</pre>

<p>DeLint's latest novel is a compactly crafted blend of most of
the standard Celto-European fantasy ingredients. The hero is an
orphaned youth with the blood of wild folk and harpers but no
training. A bevy of legendary creatures, including a dwarf, a
half-deer centaur, and a sentient bear, befriend and guide him in a
journey that starts as a quest to save a goddess from a broken
bargain with an evil god and ends in a struggle to save himself,
his friends, and his world from ultimate evil. Though not in the
same league as "The Lord of the Rings," or even of "The Fionavar
Tapestry," "The Harp of the Grey Rose is an enjoyable quick read
for lovers of epic fantasy. [Guest reviewer: Cathy Olanich]</p>

<pre>
%T Tehanu
%A Ursula K. LeGuin
%I Bantam/Spectra
%D February 1991
%O paperback, US$4.95
%P 252
%G 0-553-28873-3
</pre>

<p>"Tehanu," LeGuin's conclusion to the Earthsea cycle, returns the
reader to the island of Gont, where Tenar, once a powerful
priestess and apprentice to a mage, has made a quiet living for
herself as a farmer's wife. Impressive reading by itself, "Tehanu"
gains added richness if read, as the author patently intends, as a
conclusion to the three earlier Earthsea books. The only flaw in
this movingly written tale is the obviousness with which LeGuin
emphasizes the subtler kinds of oppression inflicted upon women by
a male-dominated hierarchical culture; a reader sensitive enough to
appreciate "Tehanu" is unlikely to need LeGuin's sermonizing, in
the form of pseudo- rhetorical questions by her female characters,
to get the message. [Guest reviewer: Cathy Olanich]</p>

<pre>
 
%T Wild Cards VIII: One-Eyed Jacks
%A George R. R. Martin, ed.
%I Bantam Spectra
%D February 1991
%O paperback, US$4.95
%P 326
%G 0-553-28852-0
</pre>

<p>Martin and the authors who have collaborated on the various
"Wild Cards" stories are to be commended for turning out story
anthologies of high, consistent quality. "One-Eyed Jacks," the
eighth of these anthologies, continues the trend. Unfortunately,
this collection exemplifies another trend of the series --
depicting increasing levels of violence, misery, and psychopathic
joker and ace behavior. For those unrepelled by mega-doses of gore
and crime, however, "One-Eyed Jacks" is a good, fast-paced read.
