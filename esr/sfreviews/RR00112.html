<h1 class="c1">Raymond's Reviews #112</h1>

<p>I've been busy with my <em>own</em> book for months now, but I'm
finally out from under and Raymond's Reviews will start appearing
regularly once again -- but mostly short takes until I catch up.
This is February releases #4.</p>

<pre>
%T The Lost City of Zork
%A Robin Bailey
%I Avon
%D February 1991
%O paperback, US$4.50
%P 300
%G 0-380-75389-8
</pre>

<p>This novel set in the world of Infocom's popular Zork fantasy
game is just as much silly fun as one might expect, and a vast
improvement indeed on George Alec Effinger's incoherent <cite>The
Zork Chronicles</cite> (<a href="RR00070.html">RR#70</a>). The
characters are stock and the setting is familiar, but the puns are
delightfully awful and the in-jokes appropriate. Enjoy.</p>

<pre>
%T D'Shai
%A Joel Rosenberg
%I Berkeley/Ace
%D February 1991
%O paperback, US$4.95
%P 327
%G 0-441-15751-3
</pre>

<p>This is a fine, original fantasy (first of a series) reminiscent
in some ways of Steven Brust's Taltos novels but clearly not
derivative of them. In D'Shai, a troubled kingdom somewhat
resembling medieval Japan, society is rigidly caste-ridden. Each
cast has a `kazuh', or gift of power. The protagonist is born into
an acrobatic troupe, but does not have an acrobat's kazuh, nor any
of the other fifty-one kinds his society recognizes. He will,
eventually, find out what it is; but he must survive, and solve a
murder which shatters his life, first. Very tasty stuff, and
recommended.</p>
