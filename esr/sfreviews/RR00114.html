<p>Start with David Wingrove's obvious skills: his masterly ear for
the English language, his ability to make fictional characters seem
more vivid and unique than half the politicians we've seen on
television, his ability to choreograph and depict scenes with the
dramatic immediacy of television and the microscopic detail of a
medieval illumination. One would expect an author with these
abilities to be ideally qualified to write the sprawling epic of a
Chinese-dominated Earth of which Wingrove has dreamed.</p>

<p>Yet something is oddly amiss about "The Middle Kingdom," the
opening volume of "Chung Kuo." Though apparently genuinely inamored
of minutiae, Wingrove is oddly disinterested in making the broader
background of his epic believable. Instead, he buries one-sentence
explanations amid pages of drama. In year 2190, virtually of the 34
billion people alive on Earth live in -- and have never been
outside of -- a vast tower of a city called Chung Kuo. History
before the Chinese takeover has been rewritten to eradicate all
memory of the Roman Empire, the United States of America, and any
other suggestion that the "Hung Mao" -- Europeans -- were ever
anything but Chinese subjects.</p>

<p>Wingrove's answers leave too many questions in their wake. Among
them: Even with a super-plastic, how do you build a tower large
enough to hold 34 billion people without toppling or breaking
apart? How did the Chinese succeed in overthrowing the entire West?
And how, for god's sake, did they manage to build a
super-civilization and virtually obliterate all memory of prior
history in a scant 200 years? Perhaps Wingrove has answers to these
questions, but he shows no sign of willingness to reveal them to
his readers.</p>

<p>Smaller scale implausibilities also cast shadows on the
credibility of Wingrove's story. For instance, at the very
beginning of "The Middle Kingdom" a pair of assassins nearly botch
their getaway (from an act of destruction critical to the novel's
plot) because one of them mistimed the dosage of a drug needed to
tolerate conditions "Above the Net." But why should street-wise
killers from the savage underbelly of the City (where the assassins
live) need drugs to tolerate conditions in a supposedly
<em>better</em> neighborhood? And readers are likely to doubt the
accuracy of Wingrove's lavish use of Mandarin terms and lore upon
reading his description of yin as "positive and light and male" and
yang as "negative and dark and female." (p. 312).</p>

<p>There is a territory outside Chung Kuo called the Domain which
is a re-creation of a quaint old British village. Ben Shepherd, one
of the few individuals privileged to live there, outside the City,
thinks of the place as "a marvelous sham. A gaudy, imaginative
fake." (p. 335). It is ironic indeed that Wingrove has set forth
such a perfect description of "Chung Kuo -- The Middle Kingdom"
within the very pages of that novel.</p>
