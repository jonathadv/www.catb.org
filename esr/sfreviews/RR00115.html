%T Lion's Heart
%A Karen Wehrstein

%D March 1991
%O paperback, US$4.95

<p>Most of what you need to know about this book is that (a) it's
set in the universe of S.M. Stirling and Shirley Meier's <cite>The
Cage</cite> (<a href="RR00003.html">RR#3</a>) and (b) it's part 1
of a trilogy. Despair not -- the writing is competent and the world
is interesting. The result has many of the virtues of <cite>The
Cage</cite>, even though the writer is detectably a tyro working
within genre formulas. If you liked <cite>The Cage</cite> (and I
did, a lot) you'll enjoy this too.</p>

%T Castleview
%A Gene Wolfe
%I Tor 
%D January 1991
%O paperback, US$4.95
%P 279
%G 0-812-50625-1

<p>What happens to a sleepy Illinois town when mythological realms
suddenly impinge, in a half dozen different ways, upon everyday
life? Wolfe's "Castleview," the most original fantasy of its kind
to hit the market in quite a while, is the answer to that question.
The best feature of the book is the fidelity with which Wolfe
represents the townfolk's attempt to rationalize the sudden
appearances and disappearances of humanoid monsters, legendary
figures, a talking cat, the Wild Hunt, and (apparently) ordinary
people. If you can, resist Wolfe's skillful attempts to seduce you
into devouring this book at a breakneck pace; keeping track of the
details is essential to appreciating the denouement. [Guest
reviewer: Cathy Olanich]</p>

%T Shadow of the Seventh Moon
%A Nancy Varian Berberick
%I Berkeley/Ace
%D March 1991
%O paperback, US$4.50
%P 303
%G 0-441-76055-4

<p>This atmospheric fantasy takes us (with unusual and gratifying
attention to historical detail) into 6th-century Anglo-Saxon
England, to hear the life-tale of the Dwarf Garroc, who is among
the last of his kind. Cursed by Odin after they attempted to steal
thw apples of immortality, the Dwarf race is long-lived but barren,
and Garroc has turned away from his craft as a skald to wield a
sword -- and lives in fear that the berserker-madness that has
taken so many of his fellows will devour him as well. How he finds
his way out of that fear and to some peace with himself is the
matter of this novel. Along the way there is plenty of drama and
not a little insight into human character. Fine stuff;
recommended.</p>

%T A Book Dragon
%A Donn Kushner
%I Avon
%D March 1991
%O paperback, US$3.50
%P 197
%G 0-380-70769
</pre>

<p>This is a charming light fantasy, suitable for children of any
age. It gives us the tale of Nonesuch, perhaps the world's only
miniature dragon, who spends nearly six hundred years learning that
books are his treasure and subsequently does doughty dragonly deeds
defending a bookstore against a crooked real-estate developer.
Manages to be very sweet while avoiding gooeyness and excessive
sentimentality. Recommended.</p>
