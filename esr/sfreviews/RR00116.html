<p>Are you familiar with the underground fantasy epic "Eye of
Argon"? At science-fiction conventions, fans hold contests to see
how long they can read this bombastic, cliche-bound and typo-ridden
manuscript aloud, with feeling, before laughter overcomes them.
Well, that is what Mark Grant's "Mutants Amok" books are like --
except that some curmudgeonly editor has apparently cleaned up the
typos before publication in a misguided attempt to squelch the fun.
If you are unfamiliar with "Eye of Argon," a few significant
details will convey the awesome awfulness of Mr. Grant's work.
Consider, if you dare:</p>

<p>THE PREMISE. Worthy of a 1950's Hollywood monster movie. Ugly
but powerful mutants originally designed by the military-industrial
complex have managed to enslave normal humanity. Our protagonists
are among the few brave humans fighting the "muties" as part of an
underground human resistance movement.</p>

<p>THE POLITICS. Politically incorrect. Explicit and gratuitous
descriptions of gore abound. The women, who are all large-breasted
and gorgeous, inevitably get killed, need to be rescued, or turn
out to be some kind of monsters themselves.</p>

<p>THE LANGUAGE. In the hands of the average hack, the trite
premise of "Mutants Amok" would, at worst have resulted in yet
another forgettable sf adventure series. Unlike the average hack,
however, Mr. Grant is cursed with a tin ear for language -- whence
lies most of the (unintended) humor of "Mutants Amok." For example,
where but in the cheesiest of space operas might a reader be
assaulted by lines like these on virtually every page: "Blood
spurted and calcium sprayed. All in all it smelled like a bad day
at the dentist's office." (Mutants Amok, p. 3).<br />
 "It [the hero's girlfriend's orgasm] felt like I [banged a hole
through the floor] and fell straight through it to the ground and
then went to <em>heaven</em>! Oh, Jack! I want to have your
<em>babies</em>!" (Mutants Amok, p. 106).<br />
 "Your work with the rebels has been -- shall we call it
<em>a</em>nnoying<em>? Yes,</em> that is a suitable word, I think.
Annoying. I have lost sleep, wishing you were here so that I might
have the satisfaction of whipping you with my mane as a horse does,
or swatting you with my tail as a whale does its tiny troubler."
(Mutant Hell, p. 19).</p>

<p>These monstrous similes, please note, are original. Mr. Grant is
one of the few authors ever published who is at his best when he
rises to the level of spouting hoary cliches.</p>

<p>PLAUSIBILITY. Nonexistent. How humanity was ever enslaved by
creatures as stupid as these mutants allegedly are remains a
mystery. Mr. Grant's lame explanation is that the mutants turned on
humanity after embracing a bushido-like creed called "The Way."</p>

<p>Should we urge Mr. Grant to stop churning out this vile trash?
Perish the thought! Readers who laughed themselves sick over
<cite>Eye of Argon</cite> will enjoy these books -- in the same
manner, and for the same reasons. Moreover, sale of the movie
rights to <cite>Mutants Amok</cite> might even be a consummation to
be wished. Lurking in these turgid novels is ample inspiration for
a cult classic of badness rivaling the infamous <cite>Plan Nine
from Outer Space</cite>. [Guest reviewer: Cathy Olanich]</p>
