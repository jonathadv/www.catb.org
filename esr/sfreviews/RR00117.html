<h1 class="c1">Raymond's Reviews #117</h1>

<p>Catchup for March releases.</p>

<pre>
%T The Silicon Man
%A Charles Platt
%I Bantam Spectra
%D March 1991
%O paperback, US$4.50
%P 253
%G 0-553-28950-0
</pre>

<p>Charles Platt gives us an excellently detailed tale of virtual
reality and techno-apotheosis. The clearest influence to show up
here is the speculations of Hans Moravec, AI researcher and radical
transhumanist (on whom the "mad scientist" Dr. Gottbaum may be
partly modelled). In some other ways the book is reminiscent of
Bear's <cite>Blood Music</cite>. Though it's a novel of ideas,
background and character and action are not slighted. The reader is
led by well-measured stages to realize just what Dr. Gottbaum and
his friends have cooked up in their labs. Then we are shown the
consequences, of which I cannot speak in detail lest I spoil the
book --- but they are fascinating. And, in an interesting
switcheroo, the people who've been set up as heavies through the
novel turn out to have had the right idea all along. The results
are tasty and thought-provoking. Highly recommended.</p>

<pre>
%T Return of the Breakneck Boys
%A Geary Gravel
%I Del Rey
%D March 1991
%O paperback, US$3.95
%P 217
%G 0-345-36947
</pre>

<p>This sequel to <cite>A Key For The Nonesuch</cite> (<a
href="RR00078.html">RR#78</a>) is just as much silly fun as it was.
I'm beginning to think Gravel is one of those rare and precious
writers who is incapable of doing even formula adventure fiction
badly. Recommended.</p>

<pre>
%T World Spirits
%A Aline Boucher-Kaplan
%I Baen
%D March 1991
%O paperback, US$4.50
%P 402
%G 0-671-72043-0
</pre>

<p>Kaplan does a nice job of world-building here, somewhat in the
style of Melissa Scott or early LeGuin. On Chennidur, most things
are poison to humans and a religion has grown up around the
elaborate dietary code necessary for their survival. The
aristocrats of the troinom hold the majority of `underranks' in
subjection, and offworlders are confined to one tiny enclave. It is
undercover agent Aurial il Tarz's job to open Chennidur for trade.
This is not going to be easy when the only allies she can find are
a xenophobic fundamentalist underground. What makes all this work
is that the author never does quite the expected --- and
eventually, you find out how adaptive Chennidur's system really is.
Recommended.</p>
