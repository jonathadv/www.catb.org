<h1 class="c1">Raymond's Reviews #119</h1>

<p>Some March 1991 leftovers and more April...</p>

<pre>
%T Robot Visions
%A Isaac Asimov
%I ROC
%D March 1991
%O paperback, US$4.99
%P 482
%G 0-451-45064-7
</pre>

<p>This book collects most of Asimov's positronic-robot short
stories ("Catch That Rabbit!" and "Escape!", both anthologized in
<cite>I Robot</cite>, are missing). No further recommendation ought
to be necessary; these are classics of the field. If you've never
read them, you have a treat in store. If you have, buy this to have
them collected in one place. As a bonus, it includes a number of
interesting nonfiction essays by Asimov on robotics and his robot
stories.</p>

<pre>
%T The Fall of Hyperion
%A Dan Simmons
%I Bantam
%D March 1991
%O paperback, US$6.95
%P 517
%G 0-553-28820-2
</pre>

<p>This isn't exactly a sequel to last year's terrific
<cite>Hyperion</cite>; they are parts one and two of a meganovel
which is unquestionably one of the best large-screen SF epics of
the last decade. There's so <em>much</em> good stuff in these
novels that I'm not even going to try to synopsize them -- just
urge you to buy them and prepare to be delighted, provoked,
thrilled, stimulated, challenged, and entertained. Incredible
stuff, up there with the best work being done in hard SF today.</p>

<pre>
%T Forsake the Sky
%A Tim Powers
%I TOR
%D April 1991
%O paperback, US$2.95
%P 217
%G 0-812-54973-2
</pre>

<p>This revised edition of a 1976 Laser Book is a fluffy bit of
Sabatini pastiche that one can enjoy as pure fun. But there's
something else of interest here; this was the first novel of the
man who's since become the best historical fantasist writing today,
author of <cite>The Drawing Of The Dark</cite>, <cite>The Anubis
Gates</cite>, and <cite>On Stranger Tides</cite>. This look at
Powers's style in embryo should especially intrigue fans of his
later books.</p>

<pre>
%T Down the Bright Way
%A Robert Reed
%I Bantam
%D April 1991
%O paperback, US$4.50
%P 312
%G 0-553-28923-3
</pre>

<p>The plot centered on human attempts to make sense of a universe
studded with the artifacts of godlike Makers is a venerable SF
trope, providing an equivalent of creation myths for the
post-religious world. In this novel the author finds a new change
to ring on the theme; Earth itself is an artifact, with a million
counterparts along a hyperspatial highway called the Bright Way.
Myriad variants of humanity have been touched by the quest for the
Makers; now the initiator of that quest has come to Earth --- and
encounters the first serious threat to her mission in the two
million years of her extended lifespan. For, at the <em>other</em>
end of the explored Way, a terrible threat has arisen, bringing
with it a fundamental challenge to the ethic of the quest. You may
disagree with the conclusion of the book (I did) but you will find
Reed's vision compelling and thought-provoking.</p>
