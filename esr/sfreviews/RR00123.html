<h1 class="c1">Raymond's Reviews #123</h1>

<p>Last of the May 1991 catchup.</p>

<pre>
%T Alien Minds
%A Keith Laumer
%I Baen
%D May 1991
%O paperback, US$4.50
%P 326
%G 0-671-72055-4
</pre>

<p>Keith Laumer was never a writer of the first rank, but he did
produce a number of minor classics of the genre at one time (his
Retief and Bolo stories being perhaps the best known). This
anthology was evidently intended as tribute, but it mainly
highlights what a desperate wreck his career has become (see also
<a href="RR00110.html">RR#110</a>). The two new stories in this
anthology ("The Propitiation of Brullamagoo" and "Reverse English")
are not merely bad, they're embarrassingly awful make-you-wince
bad. The rest, including the good ones ("Hybrid", "Dinochrome",
"Doorstep") are all familiar anthology fare from going on thirty
years ago. No reason to bother buying this one.</p>

<pre>
%T The Host
%A Peter R. Emshwiller
%I Bantam/Spectra
%D May 1991
%O paperback, 358 pp, US$4.50
%G 0-553-28984-5
</pre>

<p>There's good news and bad news about Peter Emshwiller's novel,
"The Host." The good news is that Emshwiller is unafraid to wrestle
with and take bold stands on controversial moral issues (his
protagonist's principles have interestingly Objectivist overtones).
The bad news is that "The Host" features competent but
unimaginative writing, derivative plot elements (a culture where
the rich live above ground, the poor below, and the jaded rich hire
poor folks to lend them their bodies for amusement), unlikely
slang, and credibility-straining coincidences (e.g., a female
doctor who has met the protagonist only once throws aside career
and safety to help him clear his name). But the ingenuity and
upbeat determination of Emshwiller's male hero to become a "mother"
add appeal to an otherwise ordinary "read-once" novel. [CCO]</p>

%T Serpent Catch
%A Dave Wolverton
%I Bantam/Spectra
%D May 1991
%O paperback, 418 pp, US$4.99
%G 0-553-28983-7
</pre>

<p>"Serpent Catch" is a coming-of-age novel. Unlike most such
works, the hero is a half-Neanderthal, half human hybrid, resident
on a planet seeded with various animal, plant, and human species
thousands of years ago by an advanced race as a sophisticated kind
of nature preserve. The hero's quest is to capture a kind of sea
serpent essential to preserving the ecology of the country in which
his people live; to succeed, he must come to grips with both his
human and Neanderthal heritage. Both Wolverton's world-building and
characters are quietly convincing, though the inclusion of a member
of the advanced race that seeded the planet in the expedition
smacks too loudly of the "deus ex machina" nature and the happy
ending seems a bit forced. [CCO]</p>
