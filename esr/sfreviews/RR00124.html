<h1 class="c1">Raymond's Reviews #124</h1>

<p>One bit of old business and the beginning of June reviews...</p>

<pre>
%T Death's Gray Land
%S The Destiny Makers
%V Book 4 of 5
%A Mike Shupp
%I Del Rey
%D March 1991
%O paperback, US$4.95
%P 322
%G 0-345-32552-4
</pre>

<pre>
%T The Last Reckoning 
%S The Destiny Makers
%V Book 5 of 5
%A Mike Shupp
%D April 1991
%O paperback, US$4.95
%P 371
%G 0-345-37098-8
</pre>

<p>With these two novels, Mike Shupp completes his series about a
war fought by telepaths, ordinary humans, and time-travelers to
alter the history of a far, far future America. As with the earlier
three books of the series (<cite>With Fate Conspire</cite>,
<cite>Morning Of Creation</cite>, and <cite>Soldier of Another
Fortune</cite>), Shupp's handling of characterization and language
in these books show promise. But his plot is, at times, difficult
to follow, and the series as a whole is marred by pitilessly
explicit descriptions of gruesome, sadistic and violent behavior.
Only if you agree with Shupp and Thomas Hobbes that life is doomed
to be nasty, brutish, and short should you bother to tackle this
series. [CCO]</p>

<pre>
%T Hawk's Flight
%A Carol Chase
%I Baen
%D June 1991
%O paperback, US$4.95
%P 437
%G 0-671-72064-3
</pre>

<p>This competently written fantasy begins with merchant Taverik
Zandro's discovery that his best buddy and protege is a
masquerading woman...as if he didn't already have enough troubles,
trying to shake the reputation his crooked family has made for
double-dealing. And his home country is menaced by an evil warlord.
No points for guessing that all his troubles are related, and this
is the story of how he surmounts them, growing in the process. This
book won't surprise any genre fan, but it won't disappoint
either.</p>

<pre>
%T Threshold
%A Janet &amp; Chris Morris
%I ROC
%D June 1991
%O paperback, US$4.50
%P 250
%G 0-451-45804-1
</pre>

<p>This, on the other hand, is pretty wretched -- a random jumble
of half-developed subplots set on a space habitat, garnished with
thriller trimmings, and left to percolate to unsatisfactory ends. I
hope the Morrises did this one for the money, 'cause art it is
not.</p>
