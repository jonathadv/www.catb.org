<p>One of the advantages of SF is that its license to set up
counterfactual premises permits one to grapple with psychological,
ethical and philosophical questions from unusual and illuminating
angles. Kress has built a novel about the consequences of a
treatment which allows one to access the memories of previous
incarnations, backstopped by a plausible and startling future
social background. On the psychological level it succeeds
brilliantly, but it exhibits a distressing failure of vision on the
ethical and philosophical levels that causes the ending to trail
off into incoherence.</p>

<p>In 2022, three people have arrived at the Institute for Previous
Life Access Surgery --- a haunted socialite, an idealistic lawyer
and a con man looking for his shot at the big time. Outside, a
plague that destroys the ability to form memories, coming on the
heels of the great AIDS panic, has turned society inward and
paranoid. The three turn out to be connected through past lives in
a way that forces them to confront the unacknowledged failures of
their present lives. The lawyer and the socialite begin to grow a
little, and perhaps to grow together. The con man's relationship to
them both is the key.</p>

<p>So far, so fine, so good. But the book goes off-trail when Kress
begins to draw the link you've been expecting between the mechanics
of past-life recall and the memory plague. There comes a point at
which, apparently in order to make a valid ethical point about the
interdependence of human beings, Kress follows a very implausible
revelation with a serious logical error. The book goes downhill
from there.</p>

<p>In detail: the lawyer character is a man with a rigid personal
ethic built around the power and sacredness of individual choice,
one in which will and responsibility and the right to fail if one
so chooses are central (in this he is presented as a typical
product of his `neo-libertarian' times). He is presented with the
implausible revelation that the accidents of a person's future
determine his choices in the present (or, at least, that they are
correlated in some way outside of normal causality that argues for
some sort of predestination). His world-view is shattered, and he
spends the rest of the book groping his way towards something
suspiciously resembling the most fashionable warm fuzzy
collectivist pieties of the author's 1991.</p>

<p>The logical error here is the assumption that a reason- and
choice-based ethical philosophy could be invalidated by the
revelation that we may never have objectively "free choices" at
all. Kress simply assumes this to be the case, but it ain't so.
Even in a rigidly deterministic universe, one might still argue
that such an ethic represents the human <em>experience</em> best,
and that it leads to better predictive and behavioral consequences
than the alternatives. More basically, determinism may be a true
hypothesis but irrelevant because we can't do the calculations to
use it --- that human beings have something predictively
indistinguishable from "free will" within the universal clockwork
because no one can know how the gears will turn next. Thus, choice
is still powerful from any human or finitistic perspective even if
it's an illusion from a God's-eye view. These arguments carry over
to a quantum or chaotic universe.</p>

<p>The fact that Kress's character never grapples with any of this,
even if only to argue against it, damages the last half of the book
very badly. It makes him look like a straw man and the ending like
a contrived authorial sermonette. Overall, despite fine writing and
excellent characterization, the result is a disappointment.</p>
