<pre>
%T A Martian Rainbow
%A Robert Forward
%I Del Rey
%D June 1991
%O trade paperback, US$18.00
%P 323
%G ISBN 0-345-34712-9
</pre>

<p>This book marks a bit of a change for Robert Forward (see
<cite>Rocheworld</cite>, <a href="RR00028.html">RR#28</a>). First,
the adversaries in this book are not just the laws of physics but
grubby human power politics as well. Secondly, there's a bit more
action-adventure flavor than we've seen before in his books. Third,
there's some evidence that he's learning how to write --- tighter
prose and slightly livelier characters (he's always been good at
world design). Still and all, I wouldn't recommend this for any but
far-gone hard-SF fans like me.</p>

<pre>
%T Beauty
%A Sheri S. Tepper
%I Doubleday
%D August 1991
%O tpaperback, US$12.00
%P 412
%G ISBN 0-385-41940-6
</pre>

<p>As usual, Sheri Tepper writes well in this novel, the life of
the half-fairy child Beauty of the 14th century, who carries the
hope of Faerie within her. Unfortunately, like her True Game books,
this one suffers from a lack of focus. Is she writing a theological
fantasy? A character study? A fable about eco-destruction? A
pastiche of the brothers Grimm? The book lurches uneasily between
several modes, carried by a plot that depends far too much on
contrivance, accidents and stupidity. The result is a morality play
that doesn't work, because the pivotal choices weren't moral
decisions at all. And the ending, rather than confronting this
issues Tepper has raised, just seems to evade them --- it puts
Beauty and beauty to sleep until some unguessed-at savior sees fit
to come calling. I'm beginning to think Ms. Tepper should stick to
writing entertainments.</p>

<pre>
%T Crucible
%A Robert R. Chase
%I Del Rey
%D July 1991
%O paperback, US$4.95
%P 182
%G ISBN 0-345-36656-5
</pre>

<p>In <cite>The Game Of Fox And Lion</cite>, the Fox (Niccolo
Renard) averted a no-win war between normal humans and their
genetically-enhanced progeny, the Bestials. In the uneasy peace
that has followed, the converted battlestar "Crucible" has been
sent on an exploration mission with a mixed crew. The mission has
been betrayed from within by someone who is trying to rekindle the
war, and the Crucible is downed on an alien world with her drives
critically damaged. Once again, the Fox's wits must bear him
through seas of danger and intrigue to preserve the fragile peace
and a joint humanity's future. Tasty stuff, recommended.</p>
