<pre>
%T Surfing Samurai Robots
%A Mel Gilden
%I Roc
%D August 1991
%O paperback, US$4.50
%P 252
%G ISBN 0-451-45100-7

<p>If you've ever asked yourself what would happen if an alien
fixated on the old "Phillip Marlowe" radio shows waded ashore at
Malibu determined to pursue a career as a private eye, this book is
for you. Zoot, fleeing boredom and the family business on dull old
planet T'toom, stumbles straight into the middle of a bunch of
whacked-out surfer dudes who, sure enough, hand him a mystery;
someone has beaten up their surfing 'bots! The subsequent plot is
slight, but never mind; the fun in this book is Gilden's send-ups
of film-noir cliche, and the various characters of types likeable,
silly and menacing that Zoot caroms off as he adjusts to the
bizarre complexities of Earth life. And yes, there will be a
sequel.</p>

%T A World Lost
%A James B. Johnson
%I DAW
%D August 1991
%O paperback, US$4.50
%P 316
%G ISBN 0-88677-498-5
</pre>

<p>Rusty Wallace is one of the last spacers, an individualist
anomaly in a galactic society knitted together by the matter
transmitters of PlexNet. Somebody has vanished his homeworld ---
removed the entire solar system, lock, stock and asteroids. Now
he's got a fragment of a Mayday message, powerful enemies, and just
a hundred days to find his planet. This book gives us a new twist
on the running-man plot; it's played for laughs, gently. A fun
read-once.</p>

<pre>
%T Grounded!
%A Chris Claremont
%I Ace
%D August 1991
%O paperback, US$4.95
%P 323
%G ISBN 0-441-30416-8
</pre>

<p>This sequel to Claremont's comic-book style space-opera
<cite>First Flight</cite> unfortunately lacks most of the action
and energy that made the first book such fun trash. Nicole Shea,
the secret hero of Earth's first contact with the alien Halyan't'a,
has been grounded by a medical board convinced that she has yet to
recover psychologically from her ordeals. Assigned to liaison duty
with a Halyan't'a delegation, she finds herself caught up in the
intrigues surrounding the powerful Cobri family --- which may be
connected with the Wolfpack pirates who'd once almost destroyed
her. But perhaps the greatest threat to her future is her own
growing doubts about her confidence. It's understandable that
Claremont is trying to add some psychological depth to what he
obviously intends to be a continuing character. Unfortunately, he
isn't very good at it yet; the result is a lot of well-intentioned
stumbling around that has neither the coherence of a real character
study nor the snazzy production values of another lasers'n'leather
space shoot-em-up. There's some nice investigation of the promises
and perils attached to "virtual reality" technology, though.
Overall, I'd say this is just barely worth reading if you liked
<cite>First Flight</cite>, in hopes that the inevitable sequel will
return to action-adventure form.</p>
