<pre>
%T The Earth Is All That Lasts
%A Catherine Wells
%I Del Rey
%D August 1991
%O paperback, US$4.95
%P 339
%G ISBN 0-345-37178-X
</pre>

<p>This book reminds me a lot of <cite>People Of The Sky</cite> (<a
href="RR00086.html">RR#86</a>) --- another ecological morality play
with a bunch of idealized Hopi/Navaho/Zuni composites as the Good
Guys. A bit more believable, yes, and with some interesting twists
in the plot, but grounded in the same fantasy; a romanticized,
prettied-up version of pre-technological tribal life opposed to a
bloodless bunch of technophile palefaces who just can't help but
screw up any ecology they touch. As usual with this sort of thing,
the writing is competent, earnest, and a touch preachy. If you're
in the target audience for this one, you know the ending
already.</p>

<pre>
%T Krispos of Videssos
%S The Tale of Krispos
%V Book II
%A Harry Turtledove
%I Del Rey
%D August 1991
%O paperback, US$5.95
%P 355
%G ISBN 0-345-36119-9
</pre>

<p>Ah well, it's not as good as <cite>Krispos Rising</cite> (<a
href="RR00110.html">RR#110</a>), but then, it's a sequel.
Ex-peasant Krispos discovers that keeping the Videssan throne is
harder than taking it; he must prevail against civil war and the
machinations of the necromancer Avshar. As usual, Turtledove writes
well, his craftsmanship marred only by an occasional labored
quality to the prose.</p>

<pre>
%T Artifact of the System
%S The Black Hole Travel Agency
%V Book 2
%A Jack McKinney
%I Del Rey
%D August 1991
%O paperback, US$4.95
%P 281
%G ISBN 0-345-37054-6
</pre>

<p>More of the adventures of Lucky Junknowitz, the hapless Everyman
who, in <cite>Event Horizon</cite> (<a
href="RR00125.html">RR#125</a>), discovered that aliens were
scheming to turn Earth into a gigantic theme park. The trouble with
this sequel is that nothing really <em>happens</em>; there's just
lots more good-, bad-, and in-between-guys scurrying through
teleportals and being confused because nobody can figure out who's
doing what to whom. The author's hyperkinetic prose and pop-culture
jokes definitely begin to lose their charm about halfway through.
Not recommended unless you liked the first book enough to want to
see the whole series through.</p>
