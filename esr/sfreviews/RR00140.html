<p>Sigh, yet <em>another</em> utterly predictable space adventure
featuring yet <em>another</em> Han Solo clone getting mixed up with
a beautiful woman and a bunch of oppressed idealists. Not a plot
twist goes untelegraphed in this fundamentally boring piece of yard
goods. And we're promised a sequel, no less. <em>Yawn</em>.</p>

%T The Wooden Sword

<p>Warning: this is a Q-ship! The cover and blurb don't warn you
that this is a series book, but it ends in a cliffhanger and reads
like a sequel to something else. The book probably ought to be
boycotted on these grounds alone, even if it weren't just another
quest-fantasy- romance that reads like an MZB or McCaffrey outtake.
Avoid.</p>

%T The Rowan
%A Anne McCaffrey
%I Ace
%D September 1991
%O paperback, US$4.95
%P 328
%G ISBN 0-441-73576-2
</pre>

<p>Another formulaic orphan-girl-makes-good space romance from
McCaffrey, featuring psionics and a feline companion and a male
lead so insufferably cute he should've been strangled in his crib.
Sure to please her adolescent-female fans, even though it reads
like she wrote it by pure hack reflex in her sleep. There's a new
dent in my wall where it bounced.</p>

<p>NOTES AND NEWS:</p>

<p>Terry Weisskopf at Baen tells me this month's re-release of Poul
Anderson's <cite>The High Crusade</cite> is due to be followed up
soon with reissues of <cite>Three Hearts And Three Lions</cite> and
<cite>Operation Chaos</cite>.</p>

<p>DAW's Peter Stampfel tells me that the second volume of the
duology that began with Sean Russell's <cite>The Initiate
Brother</cite> (<a href="RR00120.html">RR#120</a>) should hit the
presses in late '92. Same goes for <cite>To Green Angel
Tower</cite>, third and final volume of Tad Williams's
<cite>Memory, Sorrow And Thorn</cite> (<a
href="RR0041.html">RR#41</a>).</p>
