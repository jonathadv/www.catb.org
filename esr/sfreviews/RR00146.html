<pre>
%T The Rainbow Abyss
%S Sun-Cross
%V Book One
%A Barbara Hambly
%I Del Rey
%D September 1991
%O paperback, US$5.99
%P 295
%G ISBN 0-345-37101-1
</pre>

<p>Barbara Hambly is a fine craftswoman of genre fantasy. Perhaps
her work rests a little too comfortably within the conventions of
the form, but it has a depth and resonance and psychological
realism rarely found there. In the <cite>The Rainbow Abyss</cite>
she gives us a coming-of-age tale, a thoughtful re-examination of
what life might be like for wizards in a society of mundanes, and
the delights of a romantic, intrigue-filled plot that builds to a
climax of remarkable power, irony and unexpectedness. This is a
better book than I'd expected. I recommend it.</p>

<pre>
%T Escape From Loki
%A Philip Jose Farmer
%I Bantam
%D August 1991
%O paperback, US$
%P 214
%G ISBN 0-553-29093-3
</pre>

<p>Philip Jose Farmer is very good at pastiche. This one, billed as
the first all-new Doc Savage adventure since 1949, gives us the
origin story of the Man Of Bronze --- how, as a downed WWI airman
in an "escape-proof" German prison camp, he recruited the nucleus
of his crimefighting team and scotched the sinister schemes of a
mad Prussian genius. Farmer gives us all the flashy, trashy allure
of the pulps through an eye just modern enough to put a subtle,
wicked backspin on some of the pulps' cliches. The result can be
read either as straight adrenals-rousing fun or as an excercise in
devastating ironies. It works either way.</p>

<pre>
%T The Emanicpator #1: The Pharaoh Contract
%A Ray Aldridge
%I Bantam Spectra
%D September 1991
%O paperback, US$4.50
%P 290
%G ISBN 0-553-29118-1 
</pre>

<p>This is glitter-trash formula SF reminiscent of Christopher
Rowley --- the hero is an assassin working for (but secretly
against) the galactic slavers' guild. Lots of sex, violence,
perversion, decadence, grotesquerie, and picturesque villains.
Inventive, though, and better written than such stuff usually is.
You might enjoy it.</p>

<p>RECEIVED BUT NOT REVIEWED:</p>

<p><cite>Reefsong</cite>, by Carol Severance. More wimmins'
advantures for the ecologically correct. My S.O. found it too
boring to finish.</p>

<p><cite>A Transatlantic Tunnel, Hurrah!</cite> by Harry Harrison.
Reissue of an oldy-but-goody from 1972.</p>

<p><cite>Question Quest</cite> by Piers Anthony. The very thought
makes me vomit.</p>

<p><cite>Conan The Destroyer</cite>, by Robert Jordan. Yes, I read
it. Same old garbage.</p>

<p><cite>Omega Sub #4: Blood Tide</cite> by J.D. Cameron. The title
tells you everything you need to know about this
industrial-strength turkey.</p>

<p><cite>The Maze In The Heart Of The Castle</cite> by Dorothy
Gilman. Juvie city. Sweet, well-intentioned, utterly boring.</p>
