%T The Rim-World Legacy, and Beyond
%A Frank A Javor
%I DAW
%D September 1991
%O paperback, US$4.50

<p>In reviewing <cite>Scor-Sting</cite> (<a
href="RR00040.html">RR#40</a>) and <cite>The Ice Beast</cite> (<a
href="RR00084.html">RR#84</a>) I managed to clean forget the
original Eli Pike novel from twenty or so years back. Here it is
again, packaged with a couple of throwaway shorts. It's another
excercise in Chandleresque first-person-gritty, not quite as well
executed as the more recent ones but competent, overall (the
science is poor, though). If you like the other Pike books, add
this to your collection; otherwise, don't bother with it.</p>

<pre>
%T Red Iron Nights
%A Glen Cook
%I ROC
%D September 1991
%O paperback, US$3.99
%P 270
%G ISBN 0-451-45108-2
</pre>

<p>Garrett, that tough-guy P.I. in a city full of elves, trolls,
mages, dwarves, ratmen, dwarves and corruption, is back. Maybe he
shouldn't be; the previous books (beginning with <cite>Sweet Silver
Blues</cite>) were a lot of fun, but this one reads as though Cook
was just going through the motions. Let's hope the series either
improves or dies a quiet death.</p>

<pre>
%T A Bridge of Years
%A Robert Charles Wilson
%I Doubleday
%D September 1991
%O trade paperback, US$12.00
%P 333
%G ISBN 
</pre>

<p>A corridor built by a human-descended superrace of the far
future stretches back through time, connecting eras and places in
their remote past. A soldier from the nightmare 21st century
accidentally breaks into one of the way stations and goes on the
ultimate AWOL, fleeing to the late 1950s. The way station, vacant,
an ordinary-appearing house in a small town, is left vacant and
rented in 1989 by an ordinary man fleeing no less scarifying
conflicts of his own...and that's when the real story begins.
Wilson explores as no other author has what the pyschology of the
time traveler, and what it might really mean to be in love with the
past. Despite a fair amount of violence and action, this tale has a
gentle, humanistic core. It's well-written enough to incline one to
tolerance for the dismissive way the author treats the potential
for temporal paradox. Recommended, though not at trade-paperback
prices.</p>
