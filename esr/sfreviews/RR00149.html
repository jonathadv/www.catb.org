<p>After C. S. Friedman's remarkable debut in <cite>In Conquest
Born</cite>, I was quite disappointed by her sprawling, unfocused
second novel <cite>Madness Season</cite>. This third is quite a bit
better, but still suffers from being flabby and luridly overwritten
in spots.</p>

<p>I'm beginning to develop a suspicion that Friedman is one of
those writers that needs a strong editorial hand to trim the
excesses of her talent. My guess is she had it in
<cite>Conquest</cite>, but the remarkable success of that novel got
her too free a hand in <cite>Season</cite>. This, fortunately, is a
more disciplined and much superior work.</p>

<p>On the planet Erna, floating amidst jewel-bright stars near the
galactic core, human beings have lived for 1200 years. Very early
after landing they discovered the fearsome power of the fae, native
organisms who respond to, feed on, and sometimes amplify the power
of human thought impulses.</p>

<p>Sacrifice is powerful. Humans made an uneasy accommodation with
Erna through the Great Sacrifice, surrendering technology and most
of their links to Earth and instead delving deeper into the
mysteries of the fae.</p>

<p>Damien Vryce is a priest of the One Church, a faith that rejects
fae magic and dreams of regaining science and the stars -- a church
haunted by the fall of its Prophet into evil and madness. He begins
to fall in love with the adept Ciani, a pagan. When her memories
and adepthood are stolen by demons out of the alien rakhlands, he
swears revenge. And finds an unlikely ally; the Hunter, a vampire
being of terror and darkness who is bound to the woman by his
honor, his last remaining link to humanity.</p>

<p>Nothing on Erna is quite what it seems -- for Damien, Ciani, or
even the Hunter. And at the heart of the rakhlands waits a
revelation that will shatter all the certainties of their
world.</p>

<p>This is the premise of Stasheff's <cite>Warlock</cite> series
played seriously, rather than for laughs. Damned impressively, too;
Friedman blends SF and fantasy motifs with consummate skill, and
creates a world both intricate and surprising. The only fly in the
ointment is her tendency to slip into melodrama and excessively
purple prose.</p>

<p>Well, one of two flies, actually. You get no clue that this book
is the first of a multi-volume epic until very, very near the end,
and no confirmation until the author's bio at the back. At least
Friedman resolves her plot properly, no cliffhanger ending
here.</p>

<p>I will look forward to the next volume of the Coldfire trilogy,
albeit with some reservations. I'm not sure I can recommend this at
hardcover prices, but don't miss the paperback.</p>

<p>RECEIVED BUT NOT REVIEWED:</p>

<p><cite>Stranger Suns</cite> by George Zebrowski (Bantam). Tom
Easton said it all in <cite>Analog</cite>.</p>
