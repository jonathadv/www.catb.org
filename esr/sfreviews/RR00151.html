<p>On first reading "Harmony," Marjorie Bradley Kellogg's latest
novel, it is difficult to find anything to dislike. Kellogg has a
fine ear for language, a sensitive hand with character creation and
development, and a solid understanding of plot construction. More
importantly, she has followed the fundamental credo of Writing
About What She Knows. Kellogg designs theater scenery herself, and
her story, which involves an internationally-acclaimed
"scenographer" in a twenty-first century artist's colony, provides
a fascinating portrait of the bustle and glamor of backstage
life.</p>

<p>So what is wrong with that? Nothing. Well, only one thing...what
she has written isn't really science fiction. A bare-bones plot
synopsis, with the futuristic elements carefully extracted, will
help explain what I mean.</p>

<p>Kellogg's heroine, Gwinn, yearns to be an artist, but the city
where she lives has outlawed art, and it is very rare for citizens
of one city to travel to or be accepted by another community.
Fortunately, she is accepted on a trial basis by an enclave of
artists called Harmony. After Gwinn settles down into life as an
apprentice to Micah Cervantes, Harmony's leading "scenographer," he
takes on an unusual project -- set design for a play composed by a
traveling South Pacific troupe called The Eye. Shortly after The
Eye arrives, a movement to eject non-citizen apprentices like Gwinn
and to close the doors on the acceptance of new ones erupts in
Harmony. While fighting for her own rights under the very laws some
of Harmony's citizens are trying to change, Gwinn learns that The
Eye is really a group of libertarian revolutionaries fighting to
open the enclaves, and she ultimately joins their cause.</p>

<p>The only science fictional element in this tale lies in
precisely why and how the "enclaves" have become isolated. They are
cities that have chosen to protect themselves from an ecologically
poisoned Earth by enclosing themselves in city- force field domes
and refusing to admit strangers. Against this backdrop, Kellogg
paints a vivid picture of how people use political measures to
trample others' rights when their security is threatened. But
ecological disaster and force fields are not essential to that
picture -- a feudal culture of stone-walled keeps threatened by
plague-carrying "Outsiders" would have done as well.</p>

<p>Moreover, by minimizing the science fictional element, Kellogg
dodges the very ethical issues that the novel seems to address. She
suggests that the world "Outside" is no longer dangerous to human
life and that the "closed door" policy on which dome culture is
based is irrational. If this assumption holds, Harmony's rejection
of non-citizens is irrational and the Eye's "open door policy" is
both heroic and right. But by making this implicit assumption,
Kellogg avoids the need to explicitly eliminate more interesting
(and more clearly science fictional) explanations for Harmony's
decisions. If danger remains from eliminating the domes or even
from relaxation of restrictions on allowing outsiders to enter,
Harmony's concern is at least justifiable, and the Eye's position
may be unethical -- possibilities Kellogg plainly refuses to
consider.</p>

<p>"Harmony" is a fresh and impressive tales of courageous
opposition to tyranny and oppression. But it isn't science fiction.
If Kellogg wishes to write science fiction, she should take a
lesson from Heinlein, or Clarke, or even Harlan Ellison, and make
sure that the ethical choices she poses for her characters arise
from the technology they've adopted. [CCO]</p>
