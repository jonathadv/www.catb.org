<p>The only thing wrong with "Tigana" is that it's
<cite>merely</cite> very good.</p>

<p>"Tigana" is the latest fantasy novel by Guy Gavriel Kay, author
of the renowned trilogy "The Fionavar Tapestry." Aside from being
beautifully written, "The Fionavar Tapestry" had almost every other
redeeming virtue one could demand of fantasy - - epic sweep,
compelling archetypes, psychological depth. What's more, these
elements were interwoven so tightly that they endowed mythical
Fionavar with the rich, living feel of reality itself.</p>

<p>By contrast, "Tigana" is more conventional fare. Here, rival
sorcerer-tyrants war for control of a peninsula called the Palm.
One of the two, for personal reasons, has eradicated the province
called Tigana; he has not only subdued and renamed it, but has cast
a spell that makes it impossible for anyone, save other magic users
and those Tiganese alive at the time of his conquest, to read the
name or hear it spoken. A small, brave handful of individuals
succeed in instigating a war of mutual destruction between the
sorcerers, liberating the Palm.</p>

<p>There is much to enjoy in following Kay's freedom- fighters as
they travel throughout the Palm. Kay's gift for richly layered
detail and psychological subtlety displays themselves throughout.
Each of his characters seems, not like a literary creation, but
like a real person worth meeting. There are layers of intrigue and
revenge -- though not as many, perhaps, as one would expect in a
novel of this size. There is even an echo of Fionavar, or
"Finavir," as the characters generally refer to it, as of a land
whose history has long since passed into legend.</p>

<p>Kay is to be praised for attempting, in "Tigana," to write
something other than the type of epic mythology that has brought
him success. But unless he can bring to his next endeavors the same
level of freshness and intensity that made "The Fionavar Tapestry"
memorable, he may be remembered, in the long run, for little else.
May he let the memory of "Fionavar" be like a blade in his soul
until he writes his next masterpiece. [CCO]</p>
