<p>Catching up on some old business...</p>

%T Moonwise          
%A Greer Ilene Gilman

%D February 1991

<p>A wintry work for the winter solstice, Greer Ilene Gilman's
"Moonwise" twists luminous moonlight images into a tapestry of
archtypes: darkness and light, magical twins, enchanted children,
witches with tangled hair and fluttering rags. Pages upon pages of
elaborately embroidered imagery conceals a slender story of two
eccentric young women who foil the witch who tries to stop the
wheel of the year from turning. Beautiful but static, "Moonwise" is
worth reading for the flow of images and the wit of its punwise
protagonists and for little else. [CCO]</p>

%T Swordpoint
%A Ellen Kushner
%I Tor 
%D July 1989
%O paperback, US$3.99
%P 299
%G 0-812-51771-7
</pre>

<p>"Swordpoint," Ellen Kushner's first novel, is a skillfully
carved slice of life in a society where it is legal to pay
professional swordsmen to challenge enemies to fatal duels. True to
its Dumas-like nature, it is saturated with intrigue and glamor.
Who cares that all of the major characters are egoistical and
amoral schemers willing to murder to achieve petty aims? Or that
the "good" characters are depicted as well- meaning incompetents?
If you care about such niceties, you are likely to find
"Swordpoint" more disturbing than likeable. If not, you will
probably enjoy the book despite the odd, dangling quality of the
ending. [CCO]</p>
