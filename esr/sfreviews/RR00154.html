<h1 class="c1">Raymond's Reviews #154</h1>

<pre>
%T Lunar Descent
%A Allen Steele
%I Ace
%D October 1991
%O paperback, US$4.50
%P 325
%G ISBN 0-441-50485-X
</pre>

<p>Allen Steele gives us yet another ho-hum novel of the High
Frontier, stuffed with much the same truck-horse prose and gung-ho
attitude that informed <cite>Clarke County, Space</cite> (<a
href="RR00100.html">RR#100</a>), and featuring a cast of obnoxious
losers dolled up to look like heroic nonconformists much like those
in his first novel <cite>Orbital Decay</cite>. Add in a contrived,
deus-ex-mechanistic ending that I saw coming from about page 35,
and you've got nothing much. I am really getting offended by all
the hype comparing this guy to Heinlein; he ain't within
light-years of the old master. And yet...there's some ability here;
I found Steele's description of Yuri the mad artist and his unique
techno-sculpture creations vivid and haunting. If he ever manages
to stop sounding like a cross between Norman Spinrad and a NASA
press release, maybe he'll write something really interesting.</p>

<pre>
%T Mutineer's Moon
%A David Weber
%I Baen
%D October 1991
%O paperback, US$4.50
%P 315
%G ISBN 0-671-72085-6
</pre>

<p>The coauthor of <cite>Insurrection</cite> (<a
href="RR00101.html">RR#101</a>) gives us another grand galumphing
space opera. See the gigantic alien battleship hidden within
Earth's moon! See its sentient command computer recruit a plucky
young NASA hotshot to be its new captain, point man in a attempt to
undo the damage done by a fifty-thousand-year-old mutiny! See the
megalomaniacal bad guy leader plotting sheerest eee-vil with
international terrorists from his base in the Antarctic! See
hardware blowing up in all directions as the good guys and bad guys
face off, with (natch!) the Fate Of Humanity Hanging In The
Balance. As I've said before of similar books, this is great stuff
if you can take it without bicarbonate; utter, unmitigated trash,
but <em>fun</em> trash. Warning: the ending smells like a set-up
for sequel.</p>

<pre>
%T Barrayar
%A Lois McMaster Bujold
%I Baen
%D October 1991
%O paperback, US$4.99
%P 389
%G ISBN 0-671-72083-X
</pre>

<p>Really, all that needs to be said about this is that it's
probably Lois Bujold's best work yet. If that doesn't convince you
to <em>immediately</em> run out and buy a copy, you have probably
somehow missed discovering one of the best writers to come down the
SF pike since John Varley. This book's viewpoint character is
Cordelia Naismith; it immediately follows <cite>Shards Of
Honor</cite> and deals with Vordarian's Pretendership and events
surrounding Miles Vorkosigan's birth. A tense, funny, wise, and
utterly wonderful novel. Enjoy!</p>
