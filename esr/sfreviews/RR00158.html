<pre>
%T Mirabile
%A Janet Kagan
%I TOR
%D October 1991
%O clothbound, US$18.95
%P 276
%G ISBN 0-312-85220-7
</pre>

<p>Janet Kagan has uttered a novel that is funny, wise, original,
touching and exemplifies the SF tradition at its best. As you read
the tales of the Mirabile colony's "jasons", the specialists who
deal with the mutants and chimeras sprung from imported Earth
stock, you'll be more and more impressed by her inventiveness,
talent and gift for the offbeat character. Do not miss this! Buy
it, even at hardcover prices!</p>

<pre>
%T The Giants Novels
%A James P. Hogan
%I Del Rey
%D October 1991
%O clothbound, US$16.00
%P 517
%G ISBN 0-345-37381 
</pre>

<p>Here's a true treat for the hard-SF fan --- a handsome reissue
of James Hogan's trilogy <cite>Inherit The Stars</cite>, <cite>The
Gentle Giants Of Ganymede</cite>, and <cite>Giant's Star</cite>.
Hogan blazed like a nova in the SF firmament of the late Seventies
when these came out and they're still terrific the second time
around. Indulge yourself, and make this a permanent addition to
your collection.</p>

<pre>
%T Playgrounds of the Mind
%A Larry Niven
%I TOR
%D October 1991
%O clothbound, US$22.95
%P 485
%G ISBN 0-312-85219
</pre>

<p>If you are a Larry Niven fan (I am), you <em>must</em> have this
book. It's a fascinating collection of familiar and unfamiliar ---
short stories, novel excerpts, reminiscences, outlines for stuff
not yet written, all manner of odds and ends that add up to more
than the sum of their parts. Maybe you want to wait till the
paperback happens, though...</p>

<pre>
%T Chernevog     
%A C.J. Cherryh
%I Del Rey 
%D October 1991
%O paperback, US$5.99
%P 315
%G 0-345-37351-0 
</pre>

<p>"Chernevog" shares with "Rusalka," the first novel in this
series, an unusual distinction; both are fantasy novels that
primarily explore moral ideas. In Cherryh's medieval Russia,
wizards can change things, places, people and events by simply
<em>wishing</em> them to be different. But should they? And if so,
how and when? If you crave swash and buckle in your fantasy
reading, these books will bore you. However, if you appreciate the
opportunity to watch believable, likeable characters grow into
better people as the story unfolds, you will find these books
absorbing. [CCO]</p>
