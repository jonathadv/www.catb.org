<pre>
%T The Mummy, or Ramses the Damned
%A Anne Rice
%I Ballantine
%D October 1991
%O paperback, US$5.99
%P 398
%G 0-345-36994-7
</pre>

<p>Like Rice's celebrated vampire novels, the plot of "The Mummy"
turns upon the struggles of immortal beings to cope with the
changes time has made in the world they knew. Here, however, the
immortals are not vampires, and unlike vampires cannot be killed --
even by fire. Once the reader realizes these facts, the basic plot
of "The Mummy" becomes rather predictable. Readers who fancy the
idea of horror-tinged romance set in turn- of-the-century London
and Egypt, however, will enjoy this novel for the sheer sensual
pleasure of plunging into the turn-of-the- century ambiance painted
by Rice's pen. [CCO]</p>

%T The Dragon Knight
%A Gordon Dickson
%I TOR
%D November 1991
%O paperback, US$5.99
%P 503
%G ISBN 0-812-50943-9
</pre>

<p>This sequel to Dickson's minor classic <cite>The Dragon And The
George</cite> demonstrates once again that he's at his best when
he's writing humor. Gone is the unbearable pomposity of
mega-turkeys like <cite>The Final Encyclopedia</cite> and
<cite>Wolf and Iron</cite> (<a href="RR00043.html">RR#043</a>).
Instead we get a sort of tribute to Pratt &amp; De Camp's
<cite>Incomplete Enchanter</cite>, as the displaced 20th-century
grad student who's become the Baron of Riveroak in a magical
alternate England hares off to rescue the heir to the British
throne from the clutches of an evil sorcerer. Gently funny and lots
of fun, if you've read the prequel.</p>

<pre>
%T Explorations
%A Poul Anderson
%I TOR
%D November 1991
%O paperback, US$3.99
%P 317
%G ISBN 0-812-51536-6
</pre>

<p>This anthology repackages six excellent stories by one of SF's
best, all often anthologized before, all likely quite familiar to
the serious fan. Not much more to say than that.</p>

<p>RECEIVED BUT NOT REVIEWED:</p>

<p><cite>Freejack</cite> by Robert Silverberg (TOR). This reissue
from 1960 is just a promo for the upcoming movie.</p>

<p><cite>The Lord Of Chaos</cite> by Elizabeth Boyer (Del Rey).
Quest fantasy.</p>

<p><cite>Dream Babies</cite>, by Bruce McAllister (TOR).</p>

<p><cite>My Father, Immortal</cite> by Michael D. Weaver
(Avon).</p>

<p><cite>The Outcast</cite> by Louise Cooper (TOR). Second volume,
never saw 1st.</p>
