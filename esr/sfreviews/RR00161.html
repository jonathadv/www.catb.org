%T The Revenge of the Rose
%A Michael Moorcock
%I Ace
%D November 1991
%O clothbound,  US$17.95

%G 0-441-71844-2
</pre>

<p>Apparently Moorcock intends to go on writing novels about Elric
of Melnibone, the most popular incarnation of the Eternal Champion,
as long as he can find space-time niches in which to set them (and,
of course, as long as readers are willing to buy them). His latest,
"The Revenge of the Rose," is a pleasant but slight tale about
Elric's search for the artifact in which his father has hidden his
soul. Like all the Eternal Champion stories, it is filled with
bizarre landscapes and magical artifacts and hinges upon the
struggle between Chaos and Law. Unlike most of them, it has a
genuinely happy, if vague, ending. [CCO]</p>

%T Twistor

%D November 1991
%O paperback, US$3.99
%P 338
%G ISBN 0-380-71027-7
</pre>

<p>Noted physicist and <cite>Analog</cite> columnist John Cramer's
long-awaited first novel is a treat, a classic Campbellian rave-up
for the hard-SF fan. When physicist David Harrison serendipitously
discovers a gateway into an alternate continuum, he sees at first
only the scientific bonanza it promises. Others more pragmatic and
ruthless see real-world consequences and the chance of power ---
and soon, only Harrison's intelligence and his mastery of physical
laws stand between him and death. The spirit of Smith's <cite>Venus
Equilateral</cite> and Hogan's <cite>The Genesis Machine</cite>
lives on in this worthy successor. Read and enjoy!</p>

<pre>
%T The Children's Hour
%A Jerry Pournelle
%A S. M. Stirling
%I Baen
%D November 1991
%O paperback, US$4.99
%P 316
%G ISBN 0-671
</pre>

<p>Like Dean Ing's <cite>Cathouse</cite>, this piece of the popular
but erratic "Man-Kzin Wars" shared universe is worthy to stand on
its own. Kzinti intrigue among themselves and humans scheme against
their alien conquerors; and the war for Wunderland is no less
deadly when fought by hackers of both species in the Kzin networks
than it is in the space battles that rage millions of miles above
the planet's surface. And, light-years away, the Terrans have
finally acquired the secret of the FTL drive. Have fun with this
one!</p>
