<pre>
%T Pegasus in Flight
%A Anne McCaffrey
%I Del Rey
%D November 1991
%O paperback, US$5.99
%P 293
%G ISBN 0-345-36897-5
</pre>

<p>This sequel to <cite>Pegasus In Flight</cite> and prequel to
<cite>Rowan</cite> (<a href="RR00140.html">RR#140</a>) is business
very much as usual for McCaffrey these days --- slick but
essentially contentless genre writing, including just the right
proportions of adventure, romance and wish-fulfillment psionics to
keep her target audience reading. I was bored stiff. Her fans won't
be. Caveat emptor.</p>

<pre>
%T The Bradbury Chronicles
%E Willam F. Nolan
%E Martin Greenberg
%I ROC
%D November 1991
%O cloyhbound, US$19.95
%P 327
%G ISBN 0-451-45134-1
</pre>

<p>I don't like the style Ray Bradbury fans and some fellow-writers
find so appealing, and I don't like many of the authors who've
gathered here to pay tribute. Nevertheless, I can tell the
difference between something done badly and something done well
that I dislike for other reasons, and it looks to me as though this
anthology is a must-have if you are a Bradbury fan. The only piece
in it I really enjoyed was Nolan's Bradbury parody at the end, but
if you are one of those still enthralled by Bradbury's muse you
will probably find much more to enjoy.</p>

<pre>
%T Anne Rice's The Vampire Lestat: A Graphic Novel
%A Faye Perozich / Daerick Gross
%I Ballantine
%D November 1991
%O paperback, US$25.00
%G 0-345-37394-4
</pre>

<p>It was inevitable that someone would attempt to adapt Anne
Rice's vampire books to the graphic novel format. Unfortunately,
this volume is but a pale echo of Rice's fearless depiction of
diabolical glory. Faye Perozich succeeds in condensing Rice's prose
into a comprehensible narrative, but Daerick Gross's paintings are
too vague and impressionistic to do justice to the painful
intensity of Lestat's vampiric experience. His clever use of blood
and fire motifs does not quite succeed in capturing the warped
poetry of the violence described in Rice's text. The result: a
failure, albeit a brilliant one. [CCO]</p>

<pre>
%T Leroni of Darkover
%A Marion Zimmer Bradley, ed.
%I DAW 
%D November 1991
%O paperback, 334 pp, US$4.99
%G 0-88677-494-2
</pre>

<p>"Leroni of Darkover" is typical of MZB's Darkover theme
anthologies; it contains a number of slight, charming stories by
women of all ages about various aspects of Darkovan life. The
writing is far from extraordinary, but the stories are pleasant
enough if the reader is sufficiently familiar with, and fond of,
the Darkover novels. [CCO]</p>
