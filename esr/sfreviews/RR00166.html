%G ISBN 0-380-76289-7
</pre>

<p>Another solid fantasy from the author of the popular (unnamed)
series that began with <cite>Windmaster's Bane</cite>. Deitz's
strong characters, realistic writing, and affection for the South
Georgia country this novel is set in all help this book a pleasure
to read (though it starts slowly; persevere).</p>

<p>All three of the Fifth Millennium authors come together in this
book to give us the strongest work set in that milieu since
<cite>The Cage</cite> (<a href="RR00003.html">RR#3</a>). Part of
this book overlaps in time with <cite>Lion's Soul</cite>, but
they're told not from Fourth Chevenga's point of view, but from
Megan Whitlock's rather more complicated one. The major plotline
turns on Megan's attempt to locate and rescue her son out of Arko,
but there's much more going on here. Especially don't miss the
hilarious scene in which Sh'kaira drags Chevenga off into the
bushes...</p>

%D December 1991
%O paperback, US$4.99
%P 374
%G ISBN 0-671-72095-3
</pre>

<p>This charming, original fantasy has a setting unusual for the
genre --- the northwest frontier of the British Raj, around 1884.
Tamai is a failed sorceress in the hidden mountain kingdom of
Gandhara. When the magic of Gandhara proves no match for repeating
rifles in the hands of the Tsar's Cossacks, Tamai essays a perilous
journey south through the mountains in search of modern arms. The
adventure story that follows blends elements of high fantasy with
Kipling's India -- and, in fact Kipling himself, then a newspaper
correspondent, plays no insignificant role in the action. This is
fun stuff, and I hope for more work as inventive from Ms. Ball.</p>

%P 208
%G ISBN 0-88677-497-7
</pre>

<p>Another competent but unexceptional space opera set in the same
odd future as <cite>The Book Of Rack The Healer</cite> and
<cite>The Stork Factor</cite>. When Erin Kenner musters out of the
Exploration Service and heads home to a long-awaited reunion with
her father, she find he's died scant weeks previously, leaving her
very little outside of a battered Mule-class mining ship and
directions to a solar system outside known space. So she turns
asteroid miner. The plot thickens when she strikes more than gold
in them thar asteroids...</p>
