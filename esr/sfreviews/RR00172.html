<pre>
%T A Troubling Along the Border 
%A Donald Aamodt
%I Avon
%D December 1991 
%O paperback, US$4.50 
%P 275
%G ISBN 0-380-75827-X 
</pre>

<p>Normally, I would expect a novel like "A Troubling Along the
Border," which is inhabited by a wise old desert scout, an
incompetent sorceror, an arrogant teenaged shaman growing into her
powers, and a soldier recruited from our world by a lustful
goddess, to be a boring mishmosh of the worst fantasy cliches. Yet
instead it is a good read, because these hackeneyed roles are not
carelessly reworked but are animated by believable, intesteting
characters, who react to each other in surprising ways and are not
quite what they seem to be. The holes in their backgrounds,
however, reveal too clearly that this book is a sequel, so try to
read the previous volume, "A Name to Conjure With," first.

%T Yvgenie
%A C.J. Cherryh
%I Del Rey
%D November 1991
%O clothbound, US$19.00
%P 280
%G ISBN 0-345-36784-7
</pre>

<p><cite>Yvegenie</cite> is the conclusion to the Russian fantasy
series begun by Cherryh in <cite>Rusalka</cite> (see <a
href="RR00158.html">RR#158</a>) and continued in
<cite>Chernovog</cite>. Everything I've previously said about these
books applies. [CCO]</p>

<pre>
%T Remaking History
%A Kim Stanley Robinson
%I TOR
%D December 1991
%O paperback, US$18.95
%P 274
%G ISBN 0-312-85126-X
</pre>

<p>Uh oh, Kim Stanley Robinson's trying to be an artiste again.
I've commented before (<a href="RR00065.html">RR#65</a>) that this
debilitating disease of young writers is one to which he seems
particularly prone. The result is a collection of atmospheric,
well-written meditations that may hit big with the literary-merit
mafia but have almost nothing to do with SF and abandon its
traditional virtues. To be fair, the one exception (<cite>Sensitive
Dependence On Initial Conditions</cite>) is a
<em>spectacularly</em> good SF story...original, gripping, and
experimental in a way that succeeds brilliantly. But I found the
rest pointless and/or boring, often intolerably so. Caveat
emptor.</p>

<p>RECEIVED BUT NOT REVIEWED:</p>

<p><cite>A Matter Of Taste</cite>, by Fred Saberhagen (TOR). Yet
Another Vampire Novel.</p>

<p><cite>The Sorceress And The Cygnet</cite>, by Patricia A.
McKillip (Ace). Yet Another coming-of-age fantasy.</p>

<p><cite>Omega Sub #5: Death Dive</cite> by J. D. Cameron (Avon).
Utter bilge...</p>

<p><cite>Hook</cite> by Terry Brooks (Ballantine). A movie tie-in
by Terry "Shannara" Brooks? Goddess help us all... <cite>The Last
Of The Renshai</cite> by Mickey Zucker Reichert (DAW). Yet another
overweight warrior-hero-of-the-prophecy fantasy.</p>

<p><cite>City</cite> by Clifford Simak (Collier). Reissue of a
Golden Age classic I personally never liked very much. Of
historical interest.</p>

<p><cite>Virtual Mode</cite> by Piers Anthony (Ace). So bad that I
gave up in disgust within a handful of pages. Yecch...</p>
