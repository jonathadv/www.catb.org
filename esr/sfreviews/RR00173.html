<p>Sheri Tepper's ability to bring complex characters and the world
they inhabit, to vivid life is undeniable. But as with many authors
of her caliber, Tepper's stories serve as vehicles to convey views
about ethical issues. In "Raising the Stones," she does so with
troubling results.</p>

<p>"Raising the Stones" is set on an agricultural planet called
Hobbs Land. Its culture is egalitarian and peaceful, and becomes
more so upon the discovery of local "gods," deceased native
sentients whose presence seems to exercise a pacific and unifying
effect upon the human populace.</p>

<p>One of the important men on Hobbs Land is Samasnier Girat. His
mother had brought him as a child from a starkly patriarchical and
bloodily fanatical planet called Voorstod, from which she had fled
to avoid further (societially-sanctioned) abuse from her husband,
Sam's father. Sam becomes obsessed with learning who his father was
and what his life stood for. Ultimately, the Voorstoders,
interested only in conquering territory for their bloodthirsty god,
try to take Hobbs Land, and Sam confronts his father man to
man:</p>

<p>"Tell me about your God, Dad. What kind of a thing is your God?"
"Demands ... Obedience ... From his sons ... All his sons ..."
"Does your god care about anything but men, Dad? Does he care about
trees and birds and fish in the streams? Does he care about
womenfolk? What about planets? . . . The one Voorstod destroyed?"
(p. 519)</p>

<p>Because his father offers no rational reply, Sam concludes that
his search was foolish, and burns the books of Greek legends that
inspired him to undertake it: "But Sam, Sam," she cried, "What will
you do without your books?" He put his arms around her, held her
close to him beside the fire as he watched the old bloody stories
burn. . . . "Write new ones, China Wilm," he told her ... "Listen
to the God, and write new ones." (pp. 529-530).</p>

<p>What is disturbing about this denouement is not Tepper's
condemnation of patriarchal oppression and war-lust, but her
implication such oppression and violence is the inevitable result
of male heroic quest legends like those Sam burns. Tepper refuses
to consider the possibility of a quest that empowers the questor
without leading him to ravage all in his path, despite that Sam has
just, in a real sense, has completed such a quest by the end of the
story. This refusal allows her to depict home-centered Hobbs Land
as utopic while evading the vital question of whether men
<em>can</em> be truly happy and productive without undertaking some
kind of quest at sometime in their lives.</p>

<p>"Raising the Stones" could have been a ground-breaking
exploration of how men differ emotionally from women and the impact
of that difference on a civilized society. However, by refusing to
leave room for the male side of the story, Tepper reduces her novel
to the level of misanthropic feminist propaganda. We are the poorer
for her lapse of moral courage. [CCO]</p>
