<h1 class="c1">Raymond's Reviews #175</h1>

<pre>
%T The Ghost from the Grand Banks
%A Arthur C. Clarke
%I Bantam Spectra
%D January 1992
%O paperback, US$5.99
%P 274
%G ISBN 0-553-294387
</pre>

<p>Arthur C. Clarke's fiction has always tended to be flat and
affectless, dominated by its ideas and tech-toys to such an extent
that human emotion is squeezed out of the picture. In this novel
the trend reaches such an extreme that one feels he sleepwalked
through the writing. The main plot covers the effort to raise the
wreck of the H.M.S. Titanic, with diversions into fractal
mathematics and the psychology of obsession that are so clinical
and studied as to seem utterly pointless. One reviewer has said
this book is "filled with remarkable moments", and so it is --- but
they never form a whole. Unless you're a Clarke completist, pass it
by.</p>

<pre>
%T Crygender
%A Thomas T. Thomas
%I Baen
%D $4.99
%O paperback, US$5.99
%P 316
%G ISBN 0-671-72101-1
</pre>

<p>The title character of this odd and fascinating novel is a
surgically-created hermaphrodite who runs Babylon, the world of
2020's most expensive brothel. It begins with an assortment of
apparently random characters converging on Babylon, each with
complex motives, most tied in some way to Crygender's obscured
past. Everything Crygender touches will change...and that past is
about to catch up with it. Recommended.</p>

<pre>
%T Take Back Plenty
%A Colin Greenland
%I Avon
%D January 1992
%O paperback, US$4.99
%P 484
%G ISBN 0-380-76395
</pre>

<p>This is one helluva space opera with a couple of unusual
features. First, Greenland's protagonist is female and black, her
behavior often a subtle and satirical comment on the Kimball
Kinnisons of SF tradition. Secondly, the author packs as much
variety, exotica and places-to-go into our one solar system as most
do into whole galaxies. Third, the story has a droll sense of humor
that's never lost even at moments of high drama. Recommended!</p>
