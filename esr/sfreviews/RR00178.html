<pre>
%T The Gateway Trip
%A Frederik Pohl
%I Del Rey
%D January 1992
%O paperback, US$4.99
%P 244
%G ISBN 0-345-37544-0
</pre>

<p>This book looks as though Fred Pohl cleaned out his notebooks
into it; it's a sort of Heechee-universe closeout sale. It consists
of one new novelette with nine pseudo-nonfiction pieces attached to
it, each giving us background on some pieces of Heechee-human
history. The whole is decorated with a cover and interior illos by
Kelly Freas. If you enjoyed <cite>Gateway</cite>, <cite>Beyond The
Blue Event Horizon</cite>, and their sequels, then be sure to pick
up a copy of this, if only to get a better look at the
worldbuilding that went into the series.</p>

<pre>
%T The New Hugo Winners: Volume II
%E Isaac Asimov
%I Baen
%D January 1992
%O paperback, US$4.99
%P 368
%G ISBN 0-671-72103-8
</pre>

<p>This anthology collects all the Hugo-Winning
novella-length-and-below fiction from the years 1986-1988. High
points include Roger Zelazny's stunning <cite>24 Views Of Mt. Fuji
by Hokusai</cite>, Greg Bear's <cite>Tangents</cite>, and Lawrence
Watt-Evans's <cite>Why I Left Harry's All Night
Hamburgers</cite>.</p>

<pre>
%T Days of Atonement
%A Walter Jon Williams
%I TOR
%D January 1992
%O paperback, US$4.99
%P 437
%G ISBN 0-812-50180-2
</pre>

<p>This blend of SF and police-procedural works much better than
the last I reviewed (<a href="RR00174.html">RR#174</a>). Most of
the appeal comes from the unusual viewpoint character --- a redneck
cop, a religious fundamentalist fiercely determined to keep order
in <em>his</em> town. A mishap with a sort of inadvertent time
machine threatens to destroy everything police chief Loren Hawn
values. The results take on almost the flavor of Greek tragedy, as
external events combine with his flaws in his own character to
produce an escalating series of blunders and tragedies. Although
the ending is weak (one could describe it as both a literal and
figurative cop-out) the book works tremendously well as SF
speculation, moral inquiry, and psychological study.
Recommended.</p>
