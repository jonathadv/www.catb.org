<pre>
%T The Hollow Earth
%A Rudy Rucker
%I Avon
%D January 1992
%O paperback, US$3.99
%P 298
%G ISBN 0-380-75535-1
</pre>

<p>This book provides some welcome evidence that Rudy Rucker is
growing up. The intellectual fascination and dizzy, manic
inventiveness of his early work (<cite>Software</cite>, <cite>The
Sex Sphere</cite>) is still present, but better integrated with the
process of storytelling. He no longer seems afflicted with a
compulsion to shock; the elements of gratuitous gross-out and
pornographic dehumanization of sex that afflicted his earlier work
are absent. What's left is a gripping cosmological adventure tale
that mates 19th-century hollow-earth theories with post-Einsteinian
physics.</p>

<pre>
%T Jack the Bodiless
%S The Galactic Milieu
%V Volume 1
%A Julian May
%I Knopf
%D 1991
%O clothbound, US$25.00
%P 463
%G ISBN 0-679-40950-5
</pre>

<p>The author of the justly-celebrated <cite>Saga Of Pliocene
Exile</cite> gives us yet another volume in her sprawling future
history of the Remillard family and humanity's transhuman destiny
in the Galactic Milieu. This book chronicles the events surrounding
the birth of Jon Remillard, he who will become Saint Jack the
Bodiless and the greatest of humanity's metapsychic operants. The
protagonist, oddly enough, is his brother Marc Remillard --- he who
will be called Abaddon, the Angel of the Abyss, the leader of
humanity's Metapsychic Rebellion. If you don't mind the odor of
Christian theology that hangs over much of this series you will get
a hell of a bang out of it. Even if you do (and I've personally
decided my sympathies lie with the individualist rebels) May is an
able and thought-provoking writer who will doubtless influence SF's
treatment of Chardinist themes for years to come.</p>

<pre>
%T Through the Heart
%A Richard Grant
%I Bantam Spectra
%D January 1992
%O paperback, US$5.99
%P 376
%G ISBN 0-553-29320-6
</pre>

<p>Sigh. Here's another wretched pile of garbage aimed at the
literary-merit crowd, who will doubtless love it to pieces and
proclaim it to be one of the few decent works to come out of SF
because it says what they want to hear. Grant spends 300 pages
working us up to the revelation that technology is soulless and
evil, scientists are arrogant vampires who feed (almost literally,
in this book) on human flesh, and they will destroy the world
before any of them repent of their ways. How <em>original!</em> How
<em>shocking!</em> And mainly what utter, tiresome bullshit. Avoid
this turkey.</p>
