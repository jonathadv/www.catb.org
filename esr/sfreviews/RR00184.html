<pre>
%T The Magicians of Night
%S Sun-Cross
%V Book Two
%A Barbara Hambly
%I Del Rey
%D February 1992
%O paperback, US$5.99
%P 356
%G ISBN 0-345-36259-4
</pre>

<p>Ms. Hambly delivers a solid, thought-provoking sequel to
<cite>The Rainbow Abyss</cite> (<a href="RR00146.html">RR#146</a>).
The mage Rhion Sligo has been summoned across the Void to our Earth
--- by Nazi occultists working for Hitler's SS in 1940. Hitler is
preparing to invade England, and they intend to use the lost power
of magic to crush the British Air Force. Rhion desperately needs
the assistance of a local mage to recross the Void back to his
beloved Tally and their sons. Even if he compromises with evil,
will it keep its bargain with him? Recommended.</p>

<pre>
%T Divergence
%S The Heritage Universe
%V Book Two
%A Charles Sheffield
%I Del Rey
%D February 1992
%O paperback, US$4.99
%P 293
%G ISBN 0-345-36938-6
</pre>

<p>This sequel to <cite>Summertide</cite> (<a
href="RR00102.html">RR#102</a>) delivers more solid sense-of-wonder
entertainment for fans of the Clarke/Niven/Hogan school of
alien-puzzle hard SF. The search for the vanished Builders
continues, a deadly scavenger hunt through the galaxy-spanning maze
of their mega-artifacts. Thrills, chills, and lots of neat
world-building. Recommended.</p>

<pre>
%T The Hammer
%S The General
%V Book II
%A S.M. Stirling
%A David Drake
%I Baen
%D February 1992
%O paperback, US$4.99
%P 307
%G ISBN 0671-72105-4
</pre>

<p>Well, the cat's out of the bag now --- on the flyleaf of this
sequel to <cite>The Forge</cite> (<a
href="RR00110.html">RR#110</a>), David Drake cops to the fact that
<cite>The General</cite> is a rework of the life of the Byzantine
general Belisarius and that Steve Stirling is doing most of the
writing. Those of who are military-history buffs enough to have
caught the in-jokes Steve larded the first volume with will enjoy
them in this one too. Otherwise it's pretty standard military-SF
carno with a few new and neat ideas in it. If you'll enjoy it, you
already know so from that description.</p>
