<p>The blurb on the back cover of this book calls
<cite>Arachne</cite> " 'L.A. Law' scripted by William Gibson" and
it's a fair description. In Mason's near-future San Francisco,
electronically wired attorneys and executives complete mergers and
trials in microseconds in a cyberspace clone called "telespace."
Unfortunately, this imaginative effort to depict the movers and
shakers of a cyberpunk universe is crippled by credibility problems
in three areas:</p>

<p>1. <cite>The Technology.</cite> At one point early in the text,
Mason refers to sentient mainframe computers that "downloaded their
autoexec.bat files into portables." But autoexec.bat files are a
feature of the MS-DOS operating system, and even today, mainframes
(those that are left) don't use DOS. Nor is it likely that any
electronic intelligence sophisticated enough to be sentient would
do so.</p>

<p>2. <cite>The Law.</cite> Later, our protagonist, Carly Nolan,
wins her first big case for a megacorporate client by using an
archaic real property law doctrine called adverse possession. She
argues, in effect, that the owner/originator of the software in
question should lose title to it because he did not take action to
prevent the megacorporation from using it over the past 20 years.
This argument accurately invokes the adverse possession doctrine,
but I suspect that intellectual property law has already evolved a
much better solution to this kind of problem. At the very least, it
seems incredible to assume that intellectual property law would not
have evolved a more advanced solution by the time period of the
book.</p>

<p>3. <cite>The Concept.</cite> The crux of the plot turns upon the
existence of a thriving black market among the AIs -- sentient
computer intelligences -- in "archetypes," stray energy patterns in
telespace that typically take the form of mythic monsters. The AIs
believe that obtaining of these archetypes will allow them to
obtain true human-style sentience and pursue them despite the fact
that the trade is highly illegal and archetype-theft tends to kill
the human that has generated the archetype. But Mason not only
fails to explain how mere possession of such energy forms could
change a being's consciousness, she doesn't give the reader any
reason to believe that the AIs, who possess such things as
"ambiguity-tolerance" circuits, emotions, and prejudices, are less
sentient or less "conscious" than the humans they prey upon. She
hints that humans are "creative" in a way that AIs cannot be, but
many individual examples of homo sapiens who are not creative are
no less human for lacking that particular attribute.</p>

<p>These problems make it hard for even a marginally savvy reader
of sf to take "Arachne" seriously as science fiction. However,
Mason is good enough with language and imagery that if she
remembers to do her homework, her next novel should be worth
reading. [CCO]</p>
