<p>A blurb on this book says "it could catch on with the Douglas
Adams crowd". This is quite true but mildly unfair to Terry
Pratchett, who is both a more intelligent and a much funnier writer
than Douglas Adams. He proved that repeatedly in the
<cite>Discworld</cite> novels, and demonstrates it again in this
sly deconstruction of Christian eschatology.</p>

<p>Another blurb says "Imagine <cite>The Omen</cite> as done by
Monty Python" and that's much nearer the mark. After 2000 years,
Armageddon is nigh and the Antichrist is scheduled to manifest in
the womb of the wife of the American cultural attache in London.
Only, er, there's a bit of a mixup. Sister Mary Loquacious, a
Satanic nun of the Chattering Order of St. Beryl, inadvertently
switches the tyke with the newborn son of a salt-of-the-earth
English couple from Lower Tadfield.</p>

<p>The demon Crowley (Hell's chief illegal resident, as it were, on
Earth) and his counterpart Aziraphale (Heaven's ditto) spend a
great deal of time and effort trying to corrupt/enlighten a
perfectly ordinary human being who seems remarkably unaffected by
the experience. Meanwhile, odd things are beginning to manifest
around a little boy in Lower Tadfield....</p>

<p>Mind you, neither of these two is very happy about the oncoming
End of the World. One gets used to sunsets and Bach and good
restaurants; but orders are orders. In fact, they reached something
of an agreement about 1060 A.D. and ever since have been --- well,
<em>collaborating</em> is such an ugly word. But the mixup is
messing with the schedule and that Can't Be Allowed. They set out
to track down the missing Antichrist.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in Lower Tadfield, a charming young witch named
Anathema Device is looking for the source of the disturbance in
England's ley lines. All this was prophecied by her ancestor Agnes
Nutter --- but Goodie Nutter's prophecies are couched in such
mangled language that it's seldom possible to make sense out of
them before the thing they predict has happened.</p>

<p>And then the Antichrist meets Anathema and the fun really
starts. Because <em>this</em> kid's faith quite literally
<em>can</em> move mountains. And Anathema fills his head with the
flakiest brand of pop occultism imaginable.</p>

<p>Anybody who's read any of Pratchett's previous work at all knows
the results are going to be hilarious. I'm not sure what Neil
Gaiman brought to the party, but the collaboration is just as witty
and wise as Pratchett's solo stuff. Everyone from the Dukes of Hell
on downward (or, er, upward) bumbles around with all the cheerful,
vague incompetence and/or deranged intensity you'd expect
(frequently both at once).</p>

<p>But the real stinger in this book is that underneath the humor
Pratchett at Gaiman really are addressing the Problem of Evil. They
recognize (as I think any honest thinker must) that there's an
unresolvable contradiction in the Judeo-Christian picture of Good
and Evil, one sure to come around and bite you in the ass if you
start thinking seriously about the mythos of the "End Times".
Rather than trying to rationalize away the problem or mumbling
evasions about the unknowability of the mind of God, they use it as
the mainspring of the plot --- and at the denoument they tackle its
implications head-on. The results are almost Swiftean in their
power and irony. Doing that much philosophy while maintaining a
high giggle level isn't easy, and I heartily commend them for
having made it work.</p>
