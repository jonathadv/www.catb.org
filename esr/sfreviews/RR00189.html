<h1 class="c1">Raymond's Reviews #189</h1>

<pre>
%T The Dark Beyond The Stars
%A Frank M. Robinson
%I TOR
%D March 1992
%O paperback, US$4.99
%P 408
%G ISBN 0-812-51383-5
</pre>

<p>Frank Robinson is one of those writers, like T. L. Sherred and
Sterling Lanier, who've escaped being feted as a master of SF only
because they publish so infrequently. This time around he gives us
a rather original spin on the interstellar-generation-ship premise;
a psychological thriller set on a decaying starship. Sparrow, the
amnesiac protagonist, quests to recover his lost memories, and the
things he learns propel him into conflict with the vessel's mad,
immortal captain. A dark, gripping tale; recommended.</p>

<pre>
%T Crisis on Doona
%A Anne McCaffrey
%A Jody Lynne Nye
%I Ace
%D March 1992
%O paperback, US$5.99
%P 327
%G ISBN 0-441-23194-2
</pre>

<p>The cover tells you most of what you need to know about this
book; it juxtaposes a fetching strawberry-blonde and a cat-man
who's been not so subtly detailed to look like Vincent from the
<cite>Beauty And The Beast</cite> TV series. Yes, it's yet another
stone-boring romance for female adolescents of all ages. The only
surprise is that they aren't hot for each other but both friends of
the annoying, gung-ho Tom Corbett clone who's the book's actual
protagonist. Between the covers, a strictly business-as-usual plot.
And it's a <em>sequel</em>, too. Feh.</p>

<pre>
%T PartnerShip
%A Anne McCaffrey
%A Margaret Ball
%I Baen
%D March 1992
%O paperback, US$5.99
%P 323
%G ISBN 0-671-72109-7
</pre>

<p>Maybe there's hope for Anne McCaffrey yet. Or maybe Margaret
Ball (author of <cite>Flameweaver</cite>, RR166) is a good
influence. Whatever; this book is no masterpiece, but it's a big
improvement on the fluffy wish-fulfillment romances and poor-grade
carno McCaffrey's stamped her name on recently (<a
href="RR00021.html">RR#21</a>, <a href="RR00075.html">RR#75</a>, <a
href="RR00140.html">RR#140</a>, <a href="RR00164.html">RR#164</a>).
This is historically appropriate, because it's a sequel to
<cite>The Ship Who Sang</cite>, McCaffrey's last groundbreaking SF
novel. It's two hundred years after Helva's time, and the
shellperson Nancia is beginning her career as a courier ship. The
technical challenges are nothing compared to the perplexities of
dealing with her passengers and the system that produced
them...</p>
