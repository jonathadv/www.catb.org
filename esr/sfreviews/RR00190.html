<p>The peculiar strengths and values of the SF seldom coexist very
well with what the 20th-century's academic establishment is pleased
to call "literary merit". Most attempts to combine the two are
spectacularly stupid farragoes that highlight all the worst vices
of the litcrit crowd and utterly fail as SF; John Kessel's
<cite>Good News From Outer Space</cite> (<a
href="RR00071.html">RR#71</a>) and Richard Grant's <cite>Through
The Heart</cite> (<a href="RR00180.html">RR#180</a>) are
particularly odious recent examples.</p>

<p>It doesn't have to be that way. Michel Swanwick is one of the
members of a notional organization of writers calling itself the
Pre-Joycean Fellowship, dedicated to the notion that literary value
needn't imply inaccessibility and bombast. The name is intended to
recall the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, and expresses their belief
that the rot really set in when academics made an icon out of James
Joyce.</p>

<p><cite>Stations of The Tide</cite> demonstrates that Swanwick has
the ability to back up his convictions. This is a
<em>spectacularly</em> good SF novel which plays all the approved
literary games with a sure and controlled hand --- a certain Nebula
contender and maybe Hugo material as well. There's more resonance
and idea content in the 252 pages of this book than in most
Hugo-winning meganovels; indeed, one comparison it begs for is with
Dan Simmons's <cite>Hyperion</cite>, and much as I liked the
latter, the economy with which <cite>Stations</cite> is written may
make it the better book.</p>

<p>The world Miranda is about to undergo the Great Tides, the pivot
of a 250-year climactic cycle. The tides will drown much of its
land area and trigger major transformations of the planet's
peculiar ecology. Miranda's society, held at an artificially low
technology level by controls from the spaceborne habitats that
surround it, is also in turmoil as the tidal areas prepare for
evacuation and celebrate one last mad carnival before the
deluge.</p>

<p>The viewpoint character is a bureaucrat from the office
responsible for technology control. At the beginning of the book,
he is Eliot's gray man, so faceless that he lacks even a name. He
descends to the planet in search of a renegade
biotechnologist/magus named Gregorian, who claims to be able to
transform humans so they can live as swimmers in Miranda's
engulfing seas. Gregorian may or may not have been passed some
dangerous technology by the agent of Terra, the cybernetic
hive-mind described in Swanwick's previous <cite>Vacuum
Flowers</cite>.</p>

<p>From the moment he first encounters Miranda's riot of sensual
experience, the bureaucrat is doomed --- and half-knows it.
Gregorian is a master of puppets, and his most deadly allies are
the secrets of the bureaucrat's own psyche and his past in the
gleaming, ambiguous corridors of the orbital Puzzle Palace. The
bureaucrat's quest becomes an initiatory journey in which every
certainty he ever possessed is stripped away.</p>

<p>It's difficult to more than hint at the richness of Swanwick's
tapestry. The intricacies of Mirandan magic; the mysterious
artifacts of the extinct(?) Mirandan indigenes called `haunts'; the
lights and music of the pre-flood festivals; all are bound into the
plot (we even get a manual of practical Tantra). By the time of the
bureaucrat's final confrontation with Gregorian in the lost city of
Ararat, he is no longer what he was. Miranda and Gregorian's
machinations have remade him as completely as Miranda's tides are
transforming the planet. The ending is utterly surprising --- and
utterly logical.</p>

<p>Treat yourself to this novel. It's wonderful.</p>
