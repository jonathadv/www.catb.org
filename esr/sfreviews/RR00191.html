<h1 class="c1">Raymond's Reviews #191</h1>

<pre>
%T Rehearsal for a Renaissance
%A Douglas W. Clark
%I Avon
%D March 1992
%O paperback, US$4.50
%P 339
%G ISBN 0--380-76310-9
</pre>

<p>I described Douglas W. Clark's first fantasy, <cite>Alchemy
Unlimited</cite> (<a href="RR00080.html">RR#80</a>) as "Bizarre.
But interesting." I wish I could say as much for this one, but it's
a sequel that should have stayed unwritten. The cuteness is cloying
this time around, the characters' foibles irritating rather than
funny, and the whole so mushy and boring that I couldn't make
myself finish it.</p>

<pre>
%T Lords of Creation
%A Tim Sullivan
%I Avon
%D April 1992
%O paperback, US$3.99
%P 242
%G ISBN 0-380-76284
</pre>

<p>I didn't really like Tim Sullivan's previous novel <cite>A
Martian Viking</cite>, but it had some moments of warped
originality that were hard to forget. This novel has the opposite
problem; it's likeable enough but predictable straight through.
From the moment amateur paleontologist David Albee finds a clutch
of live dinosaur eggs inside an alien stasis box buried in
Montana's Cretaceous shales, most of the the rest of the novel
proceeds with disappointing obviousness, clear up to the point
where people start getting munched on and the aliens finally land
(thank Ghod it wasn't the other way around, that would've been even
<em>more</em> cliched). Hah. Pass on this one.</p>

<pre>
%T California Voodoo Game
%A Larry Niven
%A Steve Barnes
%I Del Rey
%D February 1992
%O clothbound, US$20.00
%P 354
%G ISBN 0-345-36598-4
</pre>

<p>This may be the best Dream Park novel yet. Several of the
characters from <cite>Dream Park</cite> and <cite>The Barsoom
Project</cite> reappear together with a bunch of new and equally
interesting ones. They're assembled at a ruined ecology in the
Nevada Desert to play and/or run the biggest, most spectacular
simulation yet; the California Voodoo Game. And one of them is a
murderer...Niven and Barnes are in top form here together.
Enjoy!</p>

<pre>
%T Darktraders
%S Hellflower
%V #2
%A Eluki besShahar
%I DAW
%D March 1992
%O paperback, US$4.50
%P 254
%G ISBN 0--88677-507-8
</pre>

<p>A very tasty sequel to <cite>Hellflower</cite> (<a
href="RR00128.html">RR#128</a>). Everything St. Cyr does seems to
get her in deeper trouble as she and Valijon Starbringer race to
head off a galaxy-destroying war. Recommended.</p>
