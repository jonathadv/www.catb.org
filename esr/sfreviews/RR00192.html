<p>I remarked in a recent review (<a
href="RR00190.html">RR#190</a>) that first-class SF novels that
also fulfill all the criteria of "literary merit" are rare --- and,
as if arranged by a perverse fate, here's the second I've seen in a
month. Jablokov's first novel isn't quite the amazing tour-de-force
Swanwick's <cite>Stations Of The Tide</cite> was, but it's damned
fine stuff.</p>

<p>In the 24th century, a beautiful and disturbing artifact throws
power groups all over a balkanized Solar Systems into conflict. The
artifact is a statue of the Dead Christ, with jewels in the form of
eyes set into his wounds --- and the eyes show signs of having been
worked from the largest deposit yet found of ngomite, an extremely
rare and strategically valuable substance critical for the
manufacture of fusion engines.</p>

<p>The Union of Terra is an inward-looking empire, still recovering
from the centuries of war and turmoil following the end of the
`Modern Era' and the fall of the world-girdling Russian Orthodox
Empire. It's obsessed by its own history, perhaps beginning to
slide into decadence. A large part of the book's charm is in its
allusions to the history of Earth stretching back to our own time;
there's an almost Vancian delight in travelogue and the telling
detail.</p>

<p>Opposed to Terra is the Technic Alliance , an aggressive
technocratic culture centered in the moons of Jupiter. The Technics
have deliberately turned their back on the past and despise the
deliberate archaism in which much of the mother planet is
maintained by fiat. They aim to seize Earth and reshape it into a
utopia of metallic dreams.</p>

<p>Caught between are the Martians, a culture of proud
warrior-aesthetes, and the vast ambiguous borderlands of the
Asteroid Belt. Behind the scenes, cults and secret societies and
fringe cultures without number intrigue. The solar system, it
seems, has become too small; the uneasy equilibrium of recent times
is crumbling, and a devastating Second Solar War may be
imminent.</p>

<p>Anton Lindgren is the seneschal of Lord Monboddo, Interrogator
of Boston; an aesthete and Terran intelligence agent with old ties
to the Martians. He seeks the ngomite, but is even more concerned
with finding the statuette's maker. Karl Ozaki was the greatest
artist of his time, and long believed dead after an explosion in
his studio on the Moon. Lindgren uncovers evidence that Ozaki is
still alive, and perhaps working with a bizarre and fanatical cult
called the Disposessed Brethren of Christ. But Ozaki was a notably
irreligious man; what do the Brethren have that he wants, and
vice-versa? And where does the lode of ngomite fit in?</p>

<p>I think the flavor, sweep and theme of this novel owes something
to Alfred Bester's <cite>The Stars My Destination</cite>. Like
<cite>Stars</cite>, it overflows with energy and surprising,
arresting images. Jablokov's special gift is his ability to
communicate what it is about art and the history of art that makes
it fascinating to connoisseurs. He has interwoven this with a plot
that has all the action and story values one could wish for, and
the result is one of the most satisfying SF novels I've read in a
long time.</p>
