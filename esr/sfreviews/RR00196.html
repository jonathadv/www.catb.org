<h1 class="c1">Raymond's Reviews #196 (short takes)</h1>

<p>(These were never posted to USENET.)</p>

<pre>
%T Flare Star
%A Paula E. Downing
%I DelRey
%D April 1992
%O paperback, US$3.99
%P 249
%G ISBN 0-345-37165-8
</pre>

<p>As this novel opens, the underground human colony on Wolf II is
nearly destroyed when Wolf 359, a dormant flare star, wakes up.
Their only hope of survival is the scheduled re-supply freighter
due in within days; but on that freighter, the Ceti Flag, tensions
among the crew are turning command decisions into the instruments
of vendetta. Can the colony survive long enough for the Ceti Flag
to arrive? Will the Ceti's crew be able to pull together to
evacuate the colony, or will they self-destruct and take the
imperiled colonists down with them? This is a neatly executed
little suspense/adventure novel with a bit more sympathy for even
its "villain" characters than usual; no groundbreaker, but a
pleasant read.</p>

<pre>
%T Captain Jack Zodiac
%A Michael Kandel
%I Bantam Spectra
%D April 1992
%O paperback, US$5.99
%P 260
%G ISBN 0-553-29367-2
</pre>

<p>Michael Kandel obviously wants to be Philip K. Dick when he
grows up, and this book is almost good enough to redeem that
ambition. He gives us the story of Clifford Koussevitsky, a
well-meaning everynebbish who will dare any peril to marry the
woman he loves and be reunited with his two estranged children. Off
we go on a whirligig ride through a world of demonic chicken
salads, quantum-delocalized mall-zombies, man-eating lawns, subways
to (not from) Hell, teleportation pills, and permanent floating
nuclear war. As Cliff's world zigzags deeper into surrealistic
insanity, one could be forgiven for thinking the novel is yet
another attack of the kind of boring `symbolic' avant-gardism that
isn't <em>supposed</em> to make any sense --- but Kandel, it turns
out, is (like the original Surrealists) cleverer than that. There's
a deus behind the machina, and Cliff eventually <em>solves</em> his
problems in a resoundingly nontrivial way. Halfway through this
book I expected to pan it; now I give it a cautious recommendation
to anyone who enjoys the mad-genius-on-speed style of prose
construction. There's plenty of that here.</p>

<pre>
%T Lord of the Troll-Bats
%A Alexis Gilliland
%I DelRey
%D May 1992
%O paperback, US$3.99
%P 231
%G ISBN 0-345-37467
</pre>

<p>Third (and possibly not the last) of the duology _Wizenbeak_ and
_The_Shadow _Shaia_ (<a href="RR00066.html">RR#66</a>), this book
offers us a look at a society of wholly sentient troll-bats who
keep humans as chattels (reversing the situation in Wizenbeak's
Guhland). The King-Patriarch finds himself nose-deep in trouble
once again when the ex-Patriarch Gorabani drives Shaia's ghost out
of Queen Marjia's body and summons the Demon Lord of the Troll-Bats
to destroy Wizenbeak. Warfare, intrigue and skulduggery ensue as
Wizenbeak, Jankura, and Count Braley struggle to halt a most
peculiar invasion. Through all is woven a clever subplot involving
Wizenbeak's efforts to change Guhland in ways which (though he does
not realize it) will quickly doom the feudal system as he knows it.
Ironic, funny, and dry --- this is truly original fantasy.</p>
