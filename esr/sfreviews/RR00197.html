<h1 class="c1">Raymond's Reviews #197 (short takes)</h1>

<p>(These were never posted to USENET.)</p>

<pre>
%T High Moon
%A Dian Duane
%A Peter Morwood
%I Avon
%D May 1992
%O paperback
%P 248
%G ISBN 0-380-75855-5
</pre>

<p>Once again Duane and Morwood demonstate a knack for elevating
what ought to have been a revolting piece of genre hack-work into
an endearing, fun read. How can you hate a cop-buddy novel in which
the two protagonists start their long-deferred vacation by going to
a full-dress banquet at the best Szechuan restaurant on Mars?
Naturally their meal and their vacation are violently interrupted,
and just as naturally they shortly find themselves in exceedingly
violent trouble in a little town on the Martian badlands. The wit
and chemistry between the characters is what makes these books
work. Don't miss.</p>

<pre>
%T Cats In Space (and other places)
%E Bill Fawcett
%I Baen
%D May 1992
%O paperback
%P 407
%G ISBN 0-671-72118-6
</pre>

<p>Sigh. Yet another cutely-packaged anthology of golden oldies
plus a few blatant novel-teasers from Baen's editorial slops-chest.
Some of these stories are damn fine stuff; it's almost worth buying
this thing to have Fritz Leiber's hard-to-find classic
<cite>Spacetime For Springers</cite>, and there are other gems
here; Heinlein's <cite>Ordeal In Space</cite>, Cordwainer Smith's
incomparable <cite>Game of Rat and Dragon</cite> and <cite>The
Ballad of Lost C'Mell</cite>; Leiber again with <cite>Ship of
Shadows</cite>. Unfortunately, these are interspersed with sludge
like Anne McCaffrey's <cite>Duty Calls</cite> (from the execrable
<cite>The Fleet</cite> series), Jody Lynne Nye's <cite>Well Worth
The Money</cite> and Todd Hamilton/P.J. Beese's <cite>The
Pride</cite> (the latter two appear to be the only originals).
Overall, the effect is cheesy and unfortunate, as if somebody at
Baen stood up at a planning meeting and said <cite>Hey! Let's
coattail on those cute-animal-fantasy anthologoies That Other
Publisher has been churning out!</cite>. Caveat emptor.</p>

<pre>
%T The Warlords of Nin
%A Stephen R. Lawhead
%I Avon
%D May 1992
%O paperback, 403 pp, US$4.99
%G ISBN 0-380-71630-5
</pre>

<p>"The Warlords of Nin," is the second volume of Lawhead's Dragon
King trilogy. (See RR# ). In it, Lawhead finds yet another evil
villain for his protagonist, Quentin, to defeat. As with the first
volume of the trilogy, "In the Hall of the Dragon King," this book
is remarkable only for the mediocrity of the writing and the
banality of the cliches upon which the book turns. Save this volume
for airport reading, if you bother at all. [CCO]</p>

<p>RECEIVED BUT NOT REVIEWED:</p>

<p>_Relic_of_Empire_ (Forbidden Borders #2) by W. Michael Gear.
Mega-turkey of the "Star Wars"-clone kind.<br />
 _The_Disinherited_ by Peter David, Michael Jan Friedman, and
Robert Greenberger. Yet another lump of generic trekfic
sludge.<br />
 _The_Seeress_Of_Kell_ by David Eddings<br />
 _The_Making_Of_Star_Trek_ by Stephen E. Whitfield and Gene
Roddenberry.<br />
 _The_Run_To_Chaos_Keep_ (Quintara Marathon, Book II) by Jack
