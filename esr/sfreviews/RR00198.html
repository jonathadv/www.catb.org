<h1 class="c1">This is Raymond's Reviews #198 (short takes)</h1>

<p>(These were never posted to USENET.)</p>

<pre>
%T Wild Cards X:  Double Solitaire
%A Melinda M. Snodgrass
%I Bantam
%D April 1992
%O paperback, 437 pp, US$5.50
%G ISBN 0-553-29493-8
</pre>

<p>In the first full-length Wild Cards novel in a while, Melinda
Snodgrass gives us the story of how Dr. Tachyon recovers his body
from his conniving psychotic grandson. Snodgrass mercifully
refrains from hammering the reader over the head with the book's
politically correct theme (Tachyon, now inhabiting a woman's body,
is forced to come to grips with his chauvinistic attitudes while
experiencing first hand the most difficult aspects of being
female), and delivers a satisfyingly brisk adventure without the
grossly excessive violence that has marred some of the Wild Cards
books. A fun read. [CCO]<br />

<pre>
%T Sword and Sorceress IX
%A Marian Zimmer Bradley, ed.
%I DAW
%D April 1992
%O paperback, 299 pp, US$4.50
%G ISBN 0-886770509-4
</pre>

<p>This is yet another Bradley collection of sword-and-sorcery
style fantasy stories, written primarily by young or new authors.
(Contributions from Josepha Sherman, Diana Paxson, and Mercedes
Lackey also appear in this volume.) As usual, the quality of the
stories varies from good to indifferent and Marian's introductions
to each of them are, in this reviwer's opinion, intrusive and
obnoxious. Some of the stories, however, are based on concepts that
are sufficiently intriguing to be worth reading despite their
flaws. [CCO]</p>

<pre>
%T Liar's Oath
%A Elizabeth Moon
%I Baen
%D May 1992
%O paperback, US$5.99
%P 472
%G ISBN 0-671-72117
</pre>

<p>This sequel to _Surrender_None_ (RR#061) unfortunately lacks
most of its virtues. It's told primarily from the point of view of
Luap, the bastard magelord who became Gird's right-hand man. The
war against the mageborn has been won; the peace proves more
difficult as the prospect of reconciliation between the peasants of
Finaarenis and their former oppressors recedes. Luap decides to
take the mageborn into exile in the far West; but an ancient evil
waits there which finds all too fertile ground in his own
psychological flaws. And perhaps that's part of what is wrong with
this novel; Moon never allows Luap to be more than a victim and a
failure. You can't *like* him; it's hard to identify with him,
because he's unerringly weak and stupid at all the points where it
matters. The quasi-redemptive ending is thus rendered weak and
implausible --- and by that point you've stopped caring anyhow.
Shades of Stephen Donaldson. I hope her next one is better.</p>

<p>RECEIVED BUT NOT REVIEWED:</p>

<p>_Serpent's_Gift_ (Star Bridge #4) by A. C. Crispin<br />
 _Omega_Sub_#6:_Raven_Rising_ by J. D. Cameron. I hurl at the very
thought.</p>
