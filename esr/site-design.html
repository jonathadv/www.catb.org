<h1>Standards compliance</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.anybrowser.org/campaign/"> <img
src="graphics/w3c_ab.png" align="right" alt="viewable with any
browser" border="0"/> </a>This site is a proud member of the <a
href="http://www.anybrowser.org/campaign/">Viewable With Any
Browser</a> campaign.</p>

<p>I have made a concerted effort to keep the HTML on this site
standard, clean, and portable.  These pages use <strong>no</strong>
Netscape- or Internet Explorer-specific tags, and the few bits of
JavaScript are ECMA-compliant.</p>

<p>This site uses JavaScript only to generate the last-modified dates 
at the upper-right-hand of each new-style page.  You can disable JavaScript
without missing much, therefore.</p>

<p>The HTML has been designed to degrade gracefully in a non-CSS-aware
browser.  The contents of the left menu bars should appear before main 
text.</p>

<p>Almost all the HTML is XHTML (4.0.1 transitional) that has been
validated.</p>

<p>If you see broken images, get a
<a href="http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/pngapbr.html">browser that
can view PNGs</a>. <img src="graphics/pngnow.png" align="right" width="98"
height="31" alt="PNG NOW! image" /> This is a GIF-free site.  The GIF
patents are expired everywhere now, but PNG has better quality per 
compressed byte and I feel cleaner when I use it..</p>

<p>This site uses no Flash, Shockwave, or other such proprietary garbage.</p>

<h1>Reporting problems</h1>

<p>There are two kind of bugs that can cause this website to render badly
in your browser.  One is problems in my HTML/CSS/JavaScript; the other
is bugs in your browser, including failures to comply with W3C
standards.</p>

<p>I am quite willing to repair broken code on my site.  But my willingness
to `fix' the site to accommodate every crappy browser ever written is
limited. Consider this incentive to get a browser that actually
works.  On the other hand, if you point out where I'm not
standards-conformant it will generally be fixed quickly.</p>

<p>In practice, this means that you may trip over some of the
semi-infinite number of bugs in Internet Explorer or Opera, especially
older versions like IE 3. I test with the Linux versions of Mozilla
and Konqueror, and occasionally with the Mac port of Netscape 4.x.</p>

<p>If you trip over an apparent bug, try to find out if it replicates
under a browser that isn't broken.  Then try making a copy of the page 
and removing stuff until it renders. I'd do this myself, but I don't
have a Windows box to test with.  And don't want to.</p>

<p>Reports of broken links are always welcome.</p>

<h1>Design philosophy</h1>

<p>This site is designed to convey information, not show off browser tricks
or impress anyone with my graphic artistry.  You'll encounter three styles
of page here:</p>

<ul> 
<li><p>High-style pages like this one and my home page.  These
use CSS, and tend to be either link collections or lightweight
text.</p></li>

<li><p>Longer essays generated from DocBook-XML masters. You can spot
these by the revision histories and contents pages up front.</p></li>

<li><p>Old-style HTML. Spot these by the canned header and footer with
links to my home page and the sitemap in it.  Sometimes I'll convert these
to high style if you prod me. Sometimes I won't; some pages look better
in running Times-Roman style without a title or nav bar.</p></li>
</ul>
