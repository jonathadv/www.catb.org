<h1 align="center"></h1>

<p>For years before open source went mainstream, I was one of the few
full-time open-source hackers. I was one of the original GNU
contributors back in the mid-1980s, and I've been at it ever
since.</p>

<p>This directory contains sources for standalone open-source
packages I have either originated or now maintain.</p>

<p>All of this stuff is Unix sources unless explicitly noted
otherwise.</p>

<h1>Communications and Internet</h1>

<h2><a href='http://ntpsec.org'>NTPsec</a></h2>

<p>A stripped down-security-hardened and generally improved version of
the NTP reference code. Features code bulk reduced by a factor of 4, better
monitoring and diagnostic tools, and Network Time Security.</p>

<h2><a href='http://www.catb.org/gpsd/'>gpsd</a></h2>

<p>gpsd is a service daemon that monitors a GPS attached to a serial or
USB port, decodes the position/velocity/time information it sends,
and republishes in a simple uniform format on an IANA-designated
TCP/IP port.  This enables multiple applications to read from a GPS
without contention.  The distribution also provides C and Python
libraries to encapsulate the client side of talking with gpsd.</p>

<h2><a href='cvs-fast-export'>cvssync</a></h2>

<p>Shipped with rcs-fast-export, this a wrapper around rsync that can
be used to mirror CVS repositories.  It knows about the access
conventions of important hosting sites.</p>

<h2><a href='irker'>irker</a></h2>

<p>A message-relaying daemon useful for broadcasting efficiently to
IRC channels.  The intended use case is for shipping commit
notifications from version-control systems, and the distribution
includes a hook script to do that.</p>

<h2><a href='sshexport'>sshexport</a></h2>

<p>A handy little Python tool for managing ssh credentials on remote
sites.  Copes with all the fiddly bits like getting permissions right.
(formerly ssh-installkeys)</p>

<h2><a href='shipper'>shipper</a></h2>

<p>A tool that builds on freecode-submit &mdash; an intelligent 
shipping agent that knows how to deliver software releases to
both private channels such as your hosted website and public channels 
such as SourceForge</p>

<h2><a href='coverity-submit'>coverity-submit</a></h2>

<p>This is a tool for shipping static-checking requests to the
Coverity public server. Handles all the details of running the
Coverity front-end tool. bundling up the analysis results, shipping 
them, and submitting a job card.  Supports multiple projects.</p>

<h2><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/giflib/">giflib</a></h2>

<p>The ubiquitous service library for rendering GIFs. I handed off the
project 1994 to avoid problems with the U.S. patent system, but
accepted back the lead in 2012. This code had the odd effect of making
me virtually omnipresent; it seems nobody has ever bothered to write a
replacement, and it's now ubiquitous in web browsers, cellphones and
gaming consoles.  In a nicely ironic touch, it earned me an appearance
in the credits of the Microsoft XBox.</p>

<h2><a href="gif2png/">gif2png</a></h2>

<p>This handy little converter turns GIF files into PNG files. With
the distribution you get a Python script that can be used to
convert an entire website, not only changing GIFs to PNGs but also
patching HTML and PHP pages appropriately.  GIFs no longer have 
dangerous patent problems, but PNG is still a better format.</p>

<h2><a href="http://sng.sourceforge.net/">sng</a></h2>

<p>This tool enables you to decompile PNGs into an
information-preserving .sng text format that you can hack with a
text editor. Then you can recompile the .sng back to a .png &mdash;
handy if you need to add or edit some obscure ancillary PNG chunk
that your graphics tools don't understand. Also handy if you want
to generate PNGs programmatically using text tools.</p>

<h2><a href="imgsizer/">imgsizer</a></h2>

<p>This is a nifty little HTML authoring tool that will generate
correct Netscape-style WIDTH and HEIGHT parameters for each of your
IMG tags on an HTML page. This will allow the text portions of the
page to load much faster. Requires that you have either identify(1)
or a recent file(1) and rdjpegcom(1) installed. The RPM is
architecture-independent. Requires Python.</p>

<h2><a href="sitemap/">sitemap</a></h2>

<p>A little Python script that makes a site map (HTML index page)
from all HTML pages with META DESCRIPTION tags below the current
directory. To see what the output looks like, browse <a
href="/~esr/sitemap.html">my site map</a>. The RPM is
architecture-independent.</p>

<h1>Defenestration Tools</h1>

<h2><a href="lookout/">lookout</a></h2>

<p>This little Python script converts Outlook 97 addressbook export
files to the KAB format used by KDE addressbooks. See the project
page for details.</p>

<h1>Documentation Tools</h1>

<h2><a href="doclifter/">doclifter</a></h2>

<p>They said it was impossible. They said I was mad! Well, they
were right about the second part, but it really is possible to do
automated conversion from troff markups like man, ms, and me to
SGML/XML. BWAHAHAHA!</p>

<h2><a href="xmlif/">xmlif</a></h2>

<p>xmlif is a tool that interprets certain processing instructions in XML
documents to support conditional emission of specified sections of the
document.  It is intended to be used as a stage in an XML toolchain.
Note: if you have Tim Waugh's xmlto(1) installed, you already have xmlif.
</p>

<h1>Useful Languages</h1>

<h2><a href="cml2/">CML2</a></h2>

<p>I wrote a language for solving configuration problems.  It has
an embedded truth maintenance system and can handle a fairly
rich constraint language.</p>

<h1>Useless Languages</h1>

<p>Implementing compilers for languages no one else is insane
enough to touch with a ten-foot pole is a hobby of mine. Here are
some of the sickest jokes in the history of language design &mdash; one
intentional, the others unintentional. Both include documentation
and chrestomathies of code in their source languages.</p>

<h2><a href="intercal/">INTERCAL</a></h2>

<p>The most perverse language of all time. I didn't design
INTERCAL, nor did I write the classic and hilarious manual included
here, but I revived the language with this compiler, which also
features the first implementation of COME FROM with malice
aforethought. It works by generating and then compiling C. Requires
lex or flex and either bison or yacc.</p>

<h2><a href="ieee-pilot/">IEEE Pilot</a></h2>

<p>This weekend hack is a modern implementation of IEEE 1154-1991,
the standard for the PILOT language. The design of PILOT is
horrifyingly bad, and the PILOT standard hardly an exemplar of good
practice, but this implementation was fun and includes some tricks
that may be of interest to serious compiler writers. Most notably,
it is both an interpreter for PILOT <em>and</em> a PILOT compiler.
Requires lex and yacc.</p>

<h2><a href="cupl/">CUPL</a></h2>

<p>Another hideous old design, CUPL &mdash; Cornell University
Programming Language. It looks something like a really archaic
BASIC with linear-algebra builtins. I reverse-engineered this
interpreter from the manual, written in 1966; the
language-description parts of the manual are included in the docs.
In 1.1 I added support for CUPL's immediate ancestor language,
CORC. If you want to know what programming was like before
interactive time-sharing, build this and find out. Requires either
lex or flex, and bison or yacc.</p>

<h2><a href="mad/">MAD</a></h2>

<p>This program is a work of reconstructive archeology, a compiler for
the Michigan Algorithmic Decoder (MAD) language from 1962.  It first
translates MAD code into C, then uses the local C compiler to make an
executable binary.  You will need Python and David Beazley's PLY
module installed to run it.  A complete transcription of the 1962 MAD
manual is included.</p>

<p>If this sort of thing interests you, I keep other intriguingly
horrible languages at the <a
href="http://www.catb.org/retro/">Retrocomputing Museum</a>.</p>

<h1>Programming Tools</h1>

<h2><a href='tapview/'>tapview</a></h2>

A tiny, zero-dependency viewer/filter for (TAP) Test Anything
Protocol written in pure POSIX shell. Designed to be lightewiight
enough that you can just embed it ib yiur project's test directory.

<h2><a href='netdiff/'>netdiff</a></h2>

Perform diff across network links. Takes two arguments which may be
host:path pairs in the style of ssh/scp, makes temporary local copies
as needed, applies diff(1). All options are passed to diff(1).
Especially usefukl for comparing configuration durectories across
machines.

<h2><a href='ifdex/'>ifdex</a></h2>

<p>Find configuration macros used in #ifdex/#ifndef/#elif lines.
 Searches a C or C++ code tree attempting to report a list of
 configuration macros - that is, symbols set by autoconf or some other
 confoguration-management and/or build system during compiles.  Also
 useful for catching stray and broken guard symbols.</p>

<h2><a href='deheader/'>deheader</a></h2>

<p>deheader analyzes C and C++ files to determine which header
inclusions can be removed while still allowing them to compile.  This
may result in substantial improvements in compilation time, especially
on large C++ projects; it also sometimes exposes dependencies and
cohesions of which developers were unaware.</p>

<h2><a href='reposurgeon/'>reposurgeon</a></h2>

<p>reposurgeon enables risky operations that version-control systems
don't want to let you do, such as editing past comments and metadata
and removing commits.  It works with any version control system that
can export and import git fast-import streams, including git and hg
and bzr.</p>

<h2><a href='git-weave/'>git-weave</a></h2>

<p> git-weave takes a tarball sequence and a metadata file and synthesizes
a live repository. It can invert this, explode git repositories into
sequences of per-commit tarballs. The DAG is expressed as a metadata file
with mailbox-like entries.</a>

<h2><a href='cvs-fast-export/'>cvs-fast-export</a></h2>

<p>rcs-fast-export assembles changesets from the per-file changes in a CVS
repository and can either report on them for human eyes or ship the
history as a git fast-import stream.  Originally by Keith Packard
around 2002; I took over in 2012, adding --fast-export mode and
later a test suite.</p>

<h2><a href='rcs-fast-import/'>rcs-fast-import</a></h2>

<p>rcs-fast-import unpacks a git fast-import stream into an RCS file tree
I wrote this as a prod at more recent and putatively more advanced
version-control systems that don't have .fi importers yet.  If crufty
old RCS can import these streams, why can't yours?</p>

<h2><a href='src/'>SRC</a></h2>

<p>Simple Revision Control is RCS reloaded - a file-oriented
version-control system for cases where you have lots of single-file
projects like HOWTOs or small scripts living in a single directory
but don't want to commingle their histories.  This time it has 
a decent modern UI resembling those of Subversion/git/Mercurial. 
Also features integer sequential version numbering, embedded
self-documentation, and very few switches :-).</p>

<h2><a href='ctopy/'>ctopy</a></h2>

<p>ctopy automates the parts of translating C source code to Python
source code that are difficult for a human but easy for a
machine. This allows a human programmer to concentrate on the
nontrivial parts of the translation.</p>

<h2><a href='loccount/'>loccount</a></h2>

<p>Count source lines of code (SLOC) and logical lines of code (LLOC)
in a sourve tree. Started out as a faster reimplementation of David
Wheeler's sloccount, but now supports a richer feature set and an
absurdly large number of languages.</p>

<h2><a href='comparator/'>comparator</a></h2>

<p>This program finds common code segments in large source trees very 
quickly.  It may be useful as a plagiarism or copyright-infringement
detector.</para>

<h2><a href='ascii/'>ascii</a></h2>

<p>My utility for displaying alternate names and notations of a
given ASCII character, sort of an interactive reference chart. Also
handy as a quick base converter for byte values. There is a <a
href="http://www.english.w3.pl/ascii-2.6.pl.tar.gz">Polish
version</a>.</p>

<h2><a href="cstrings/">cstrings</a></h2>

<p>My handy little tool for internationalization. Extracts string
constants from C sources and generates in constant names,
prepending an appropriate set of #defines to the C source. Good
support for incrementally trying out conversions until you get what
you want.</p>

<h2><a href="hexd/">hexd</a></h2>

<p>Everybody's favorite stupid utility, a hex dumper. This one
mimics CP/M's and MS/DOS's dump format, either options to do lots
of other semi-interesting things. Unusual of its kind in that it
handles EBCDIC (I needed this capability once for reasons I've
mercifully forgotten). Now with internationalization.  (Formerly
just known as &lsquo;hex&rsquo; and later &lsquo;hexdump&rsquo; 
because I didn't know of the BSD utility.)</p>

<h2><a href="sccs2rcs/">sccs2rcs</a></h2>

<p>A conversion script that takes SCCS version histories and maps
them into RCS histories (change comments included). Requires the
sccs(1) utility supported under BSD and SVr4, also csh. I didn't
write this, but I fixed some portability bugs in it and added a
useful option.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.exactcode.de/site/open_source/minised/">sed</a></h2>

<p>This is the fast, small sed originally distributed in the GNU
toolkit and still distributed with Minix. The GNU people ditched it
when they built their own sed around an enhanced regexp package &mdash;
but it's still better for some uses (in particular, faster and less
memory-intensive). Now maintained by Ren&eacute; Rebe at Exactcode.</p>

<h2><a href="semex/">semex</a></h2>

<p>Once upon a time, I decided I needed to understand the System V
semaphore features. I wrote this exerciser to help me. Use it to
learn, or as a semaphore access method for shellscripts.</p>

<h2><a href="showkey/">showkey</a></h2>

<p>All this program does is read keystrokes and spit them back at you
in a simple, printable form. This is one of these silly little
utilities that you never think you'll need until some unexpected
situation pops up and you have to have it. Then you get to be
mugged by the details of tty-interface code, yippee. Never again!</p>

<h2><a href="yacchack/">yacchack</a></h2>

<p>My package for YACC parser encapsulation. Permits multiple YACC
parsers in a single program.  Obsolete. really; Bison does this
better.</p>

<h2><a href='pytogo/'>pytogo</a></h2>

<p>pytogo is a fast, crude, incomplete Python-to-Go translator meant to
assist a human programmer in translating large volumes of Python to
idiomatic Go, preserving comments and structure. It does the
mechanical things that are easy for software but hard for humans,
leaving a human free to concentrate on the hard parts like type
annotations.</p>

<h2><a href='blamecount/'>pytogo</a></h2>

<p> A wrapper around git blame that shows lines-last-toched statistics
for every contributor.  Optionally, generate a report that can be
used in an Emacs compilation buffer to step through contribution
bands for all users or for a specified user. </p>

<h1>Device Drivers</h1>

<h2>speaker-1.4 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<a href="speaker-1.4.tar.gz">(source)</a></h2>

<p>My speaker device driver for 386/486 boxes &mdash; permits you to
play tunes on a PC-clone console speaker under UNIX. An older
version was included with the NetHack distribution. This one has
(untested) portability patches contributed by people who ported 1.3
to 386bsd and Linux. The speaker driver used in
FreeBSD/NetBSD/OpenBSD is a descendant of this code.</p>

<h1>Games I've Written</h1>

<h2><a href="ski/">ski</a></h2>

<p>Imagine you are skiing down an infinite slope, facing such hazards as
trees, ice, bare ground, and the man-eating Yeti!  Unfortunately,
you have put your jet-powered skis on backwards, so you can't see
ahead where you are going; only behind where you have been.  However,
you can turn to either side, jump or hop through the air, teleport
through hyperspace, launch nuclear ICBMs, and cast spells to call the
Fire Demon.  And since the hazards occur in patches, you can
skillfully outmaneuver them.  A fun and very silly game that proves
you don't need fancy graphical user interfaces to have a good time.
Originally by Mark Stevans in FORTAN; I ported it from C and added color.</p>

<h2><a href="galaxis/">galaxis</a></h2>

<p>My clone of Christian Franz's nifty little Macintosh game. Find
the lifeboats adrift in interstellar space. Now with mouse support
if you're using ncurses under xterm.</p>

<h2><a href="wumpus/">wumpus</a></h2>

<p>A piece of retrocomputing archeology &mdash; my exact clone of the
classic Hunt The Wumpus game, exactly as it first appeared in 1974.
Also includes an original but strangely similar game,
superhack.</p>

<h1>Games I've Hacked On</h1>

<p>I often hack on existing games to improve them. Here's a
selection of my favorites, customized in various ways.</p>


<h2><a href="open-adventure/">bs</a></h2>

<p>The classic Colossal Cave Adventure, shipped under an open-sourcer
license with the approval of the game's original authors.  This is the
2.5 version fromn 1995, sometimws called "430-point Adventure" -
the last version the original authors released. It plays exactly like
the original but has been extensively refactored and improved under
the hood.</p>

<h2>xlife-5.0 &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<a href="http://litwr2.atspace.eu/xlife.php">(source)</a></h2>

<p>A full-featured X laboratory for the game of Life. This version
has many features added since 3.0. Not least of these is my support
for up to 8-state automata with arbitrary, editable transition
tables and color used to display the states. Includes extensive
pattern libraries for both Life and the Codd 8-state automaton.</p>

<p>Note that this link now points offsite.  I haven't had enough time
to maintain this code, and have handed it off to Vol Litwr.</p>

<h2><a href="bs/">bs</a></h2>

<p>My rewrite, with vastly improved screen interface, of Bruce
Holloway's Battleships game. Not a very interesting game at that,
the optimal strategy is too obvious &mdash; I just couldn't stand to
leave the interface as mal-designed as it was.</p>

<h2><a href="bluemoon/">bluemoon</a></h2>

<p>My rewrite for ncurses of Tim Lister's enjoyable little Blue Moon
solitaire. Has much better screen support. If you have a sufficiently
recent version of ncurses on an Intel box, it will even display the
IBM card-suit glyphs. (This used to be called just
&ldquo;blue&rdquo;)</p>

<h2><a href="vms-empire/">vms-empire</a></h2>

<p>This is Chuck Simmons's C translations of VMS FORTRAN Empire, a
solitaire version. Nobody seems to be maintaining it any more. I've
colorized it and updated it for ANSI/POSIX C, and this version works
with ncurses. The 1.2 version adds some speedups and corrects errors
in the victory-odds table on the man page. 1.3 adds some GN U C
cleanup. 1.4 adds an option to set the savefile name. I've renamed the
project to "vms-empire" so it won't be confused with the several other
empire projects out there, which are mostly elaborate multiplayer
network games with X interfaces.</p>

<h2><a href="greed/">greed</a></h2>

<p>I added color support and some polish to Matt Day's game. He
dropped out of sight, so I maintain it. Version 3.3 adds modern
packaging.</p>

<h2><a href="tetrix/">tetrix</a></h2>

<p>This game was originally Quentin Neill's UNIX port of an Amiga
tetris. I colorized it and cleaned up some portability problems.
This version works with Linux ncurses.</p>

<h2><a href='super-star-trek'>Super Star Trek</a></h2>

<p>The classic ancient FORTRAN game from the days of mainframes and
minicomputers, reloaded &mdash; retains considerable play value
even today.</p>

<h1>Miscellanea</h1>

<h2><a href="morse/">morse</a></h2>
<p>morse is a Morse-code training program for aspiring radio hams.  It
can generate random tests or simulated QSOs resembling those used in
the ARRL test (a QSO generator is included).  There are a plethora of
options to vary the training method.  In one of the simpler modes,
this program will take text from standard input and render it as
Morse-code beeps.</p>

<h2><a href="deal/">deal</a></h2>

<p>A little program that computes tables of non-replacement
probabilities (as in, card draws from a Magic: The Gathering deck).
The mathematical guts are from Jeremy York's `cardprobs', but this
has a vastly improved interface and (gasp!) documentation. Version
2.0 adds more capabilities.</p>

<h2><a href="xve/">xve</a></h2>

<p>X Video Explorer, help for people trying to configure video
timings for XFree86. You'll need the Hitchhiker's Guide To X386
Video Timing to use this. It's pretty obsolete; use <a
href="http://without.netpedia.net/kvideogen/">kvideogen</a>
instead.</p>

<h2><a href="letterize/">letterize</a></h2>

<p>This program helps you find letter mnemonics for phone numbers
by filtering them for pronounceability. Typically, it gives you
only the best few hundred of nineteen-thousand-odd
possibilities.</p>

<h2><a href="mstrans/">mstrans</a></h2>

<p>A tool for cleaning up files transferred from MS-DOS; it can
strip CRs, remove trailing ^Z characters, etc. With an option, it
will put in CRs for files that need to go in the other direction.
It can also strip meta bits, in case your file was a WordStar
document. Finally, it can do appropriate filename mapping.</p>

<h2>pmtools &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<a
href="pmtools.shar.gz">(source)</a></h2>

<p>A set of modem-management tools, written in Expect, for the
Livingston Portmaster terminal server. What these help you do is
gang-program the modems, or gang-dump their register settings for
comparison. One of them, pmpersist, can be used while your PM is
active; it keeps looping through your list of modems re-programming
idle ones until all have been touched. These tools can handle
multiple modem types.</p>

<h1>Other peoples' software</h1>

<p>I have a lot of stuff in <strong>Emacs</strong>, including the
<strong>VC mode</strong> that front-ends for RCS/SCCS/CVS and the
<strong>Grand Unified Debugger</strong> mode that lets you drive
GNU gdb and other symbolic debuggers from within Emacs. According
to RMS's credit list, I appear to have more Emacs Lisp code in the
standard Emacs distribution than anyone else but him.</p>

<p>I have contributed substantial code and documentation to the
standard environment of the <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>
language. The post-1.5.1 versions of the standard
<strong>rfc822.py</strong>, <strong>cmd.py</strong>,
<strong>sendmail.py</strong>, and <strong>multifile.py</strong>
modules have my work in them. I wrote <strong>shlex.py</strong>, and
<strong>netrc.py</strong> outright. I have also contributed to the <a
href="http://www.pythonware.com/library/pil/handbook/">Python Image
Library</a>; my <strong>pildriver</strong> image-calculator script is
included in it. In July 2000 I was given write access to the Python
CVS repository, and am now officially a co-developer of the
language.</p>

<p>I've contributed to <a href="http://www.gnome.org">GNOME</a>.
The <strong>NETLoad</strong> applet code was mine; I also taught
<strong>gnome-card</strong> how to do categories, and added the
Super-Safe option to <strong>gnobots</strong> and
<strong>gnobotsII</strong>.</p>

<p>I've contributed to <strong>gnuplot</strong>, especially in the
PNG driver.</p>

<p>I've contributed substantial code to the <a
href="http://www.cdrom.com/pub/png/">PNG</a> library (including the
chunk support for iTXt, iCCP, sPLT, sCAL and the high-level
interface via png_read_pmng and png_write_png), and am a credited
coauthor.</p>

<p>I wrote the @alias and @definfoenclose features of Texinfo.</p>

<p>I designed the Trove classification system used at SourceForge,
Freecode, and elsewhere.  I'm sort of the architectural grandaddy of
SourceForge; the lead architect of that system, Drew Streib, lifted a
lot of idea and even his database schemas from the Trove design
document.</p>

<p>I wrote the <strong>pic2graph</strong> and
<strong>eqn2graph</strong> scripts included in groff.  I also wrote the
<strong>PIC</strong> manual included in the groff distribution.</p>

<p>I wrote the <b>svncutter</b> tool that's part of Subversion
contrib/.</p>

<p>I wrote the <strong>rbgen</strong> code generator that appears in
1.3 and later versions of Damian Ivereigh's <a href='http://libredblack.sourceforge.net/'>libredblack</a> library, a neat little bit of code for doing 
B-trees.</p>

<p>I collaborated with Christian Reis on <strong>bugzilla-submit</strong>.</p>

<p>One way or another, I have a couple meg of code and
documentation in the core toolset of every general-purpose Linux
and BSD distribution in existence.</p>

<h1>Packages I No Longer Maintain</h1>

<h2><a href="http://fetchmail.berlios.de/">fetchmail</a></h2>

<p>This is a full-featured, robust and very configurable
POP2/POP3/APOP/IMAP mail forwarder. It's designed to pick up mail from
a mail server host and deliver it just as though it had arrived on
your client machine via SMTP.</p>

<h2><a href="http://bogofilter.sourceforge.net/">bogofilter</a></h2>

<p>A C implementation of a fast Bayesian spam filter along the lines
suggested by LISP wizard Paul Graham. I wrote this, but passed the
project lead along in 2003.</p>

<h1>Past Collaborations</h1>

<p>In 1991 I collaborated with Ray Gardner on a simple hypertext
browser for the Jargon File, called vh for "volks-hypertext".
Tim Berners-Lee noticed it and sent me email noting that he was
working on some hypertext things and suggesting we cooperate,
but never replied to my reply.  A year or so later he invented
the World Wide Web and made vh thoroughly obsolete.  I have
withdrawn it.</p>

<p>Years ago, I wrote a lot of code for the nethack game;
blindfolds were my invention, and my name is still on the nethack
manual. However, I'm no longer active with the nethack devteam.</p>

<p>I was a senior developer on the <a
href="http://www.wesnoth.org">Battle For Wesnoth</a> fantasy strategy
game.</a><p>
