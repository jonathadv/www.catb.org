<h1 class="c1">la tenguar: A romantic orthography for Lojban</h1>

<p>Given the number of Lojbanists that are SF and fantasy fans, and
the zeal for logical systematization that is such an important part
of the Lojban esthetic, many of you have probably played with
J.R.R. Tolkien's `Tengwar' alphabet from <cite>The Lord of the
Rings</cite>.</p>

<p>The Tengwar must have made a fascinating thought-exercise for
Tolkien the linguist - a pure phonetic alphabet with orthographic
symmetry to match its expressive power. He based the tengwa shapes
on the lovely letter forms of the Celtic half-uncial hand of the
<cite>Book of Kells</cite>, arguably the apogee of medieval
manuscript illumination.</p>

<p>While studying the Lojban phonetic rules in the Synopsis, it
occurred to me that Tolkien's objectives in composing the Tengwar
paralelled the aims of the Lojban phonology design. Both have
precision, compactness and cross-cultural intelligibility as
primary goals (in Tolkien's world the Tengwar were used for many
different languages, and he actually gives `modes' for Quenya,
Sindarin, Dwarvish, and English). Upon realizing this, I was seized
with an irresistable desire to compose a Tengwar mode for
Lojban.</p>

<p>You may well ask ``why bother''? I reply ``mainly for the
creative fun of it''. But the exercise also helped me solidify my
knowledge of Lojban phonological and word-formation rules. I give
this the results to the Lojban community in hopes that others will
find them similarly amusing and instructive.</p>

<p>And...who knows? You'll see below that some Tengwar inventions
offer a more natural representation of certain Lojbanic structural
features than the English version of the Latin alphabet can manage.
Perhaps this is worth having a private orthography for. And, as
anyone who has ever tried them will attest, even poorly-executed
tengwar are both prettier than the Roman alphabet and better
adapted to cursive writing.</p>

<p>The original Tengwar chart is in the appendices to <cite>The
Return of the King</cite> (volume III of LOTR (the chart is in
Appendix E, page 494 of the Ballantine pb edition). When I wrote
the original version of this paper in late 1994, I referred to them
only by Tolkien's numbers. For this Web version, I will add
references to the following table:</p>

<div class="c2"><img src="tw.png"
alt="You need a PNG-capable browser." /></div>

<p>which is copied from Michael Everson's <a
href="http://anubis.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC2/WG2/docs/n1641/n1641.htm">Unicode/ISO
10646-2 proposal for the Tengwar</a>. References are this given as
given as n(x/y), where n is Tolkien's number, x is the table column
number and y the row number. Where Tolkien describes a tehta that
appears in the Everson table but is unnumbered, I reference it
simply as (x/y).</p>

<p>For what follows it is particularly important to remember that
in any given mode the Tengwar consonants form a phonetic grid in
which alterations in form correspond to alterations in sound in a
predictable way (if you will, this is `audio-visual isomorphism'
extended to the letter-form level). Before continuing, you should
probably reread (or at least re-skim) Tolkien's discussion of the
Feanorian letters, pages 495-500 following the chart.</p>

<p>We will tackle Lojban's phonetics in the following order:</p>

<ol>
<li>consonants</li>

<li>vowels (including /y/)</li>

<li>comma, dot, smooth breathing</li>

<li>the sentence divider, cmene stress exceptions</li>
</ol>

<h1>Lojban Consonants</h1>

<p>Lojban phonetics is much more easily represented in the Tengwar
than that of English; its vowels are pure, rather than palatalized,
and there is little allophony in the consonants. In fact Lojban
phonemes rather resemble the simple ones of Tolkien's `Westron' or
`Common'. This should not be regarded as an accident. Tolkien
constructed quite complex phonologies for Sindarin, Quenya and
Dwarvish, but the Westron of his universe had the role of a lingua
franca, and he was well aware that such languages tend to evolve
toward maintaining only very simple and robust phonetic
distinctions.</p>

<p>Accordingly, we can tentatively make the following consonant
assignments of simple Lojban phonemes identical to Westron
ones:</p>

<pre>
LOJBAN: 1(0/0) = /t/, 2(0/1) = /p/, 4(0/3) = /k/, 5(0/4) = /d/, 
LOJBAN: 6(0/5) = /b/, 8(0/7) = /g/, 17(1/0) = /n/, 18(1/1) = /m/
</pre>

<p>leaving /c/, /f/, /j/, /l/, /r/, /s/, /v/, /x/, and /z/ unbound.
This follows the Third Age convention of using Grade 1 for
voiceless stops, Grade 2 for voiced stops, and Grade 5 for nasals.
Also note that Series 1 is palato-alveolar-dental, Series 2 labial
and Series 4 velar.</p>

<p>The astute reader will have already noticed that there is a hole
in the two-dimensional pattern made by these at 20(1/3), which
(though Tolkien doesn't give a value for it in Westron) ought to
represent a nasalized velar like /ng/. This is because /ng/ is
allophonic with /n/ in Lojban. Amusingly, this may also have been
true in archaic Quenya; see the discussion of 'NG' in the
pronunciation guide and `noldo' under letter-names.</p>

<p>Also, Series III (Westron c, j, sh, zh) isn't used at all so
far. This is mainly because when I originally designed this mode in
1994 I thought this series was compromised by a glaring
inconsistency in the Westron assignments; 3(0/2) was in my sources
as given as `c', making no distinction between 'c' and `k' in what
is supposed to be a phonetic alphabet. In early 2000 I learned that
this was due to a misprint in most editions of LoTR printed after
the mid-1960s; Tolkien actually (and quite logically) intended
3(0/2) to stand for the unvoiced palato-alveolar affricate /ch/ of
English `church'.</p>

<p>The other three sounds in the Westron binding of Series III are
Lojban's /dj/, /c/ and /j/. respectively; we will need these, but
it is not immediately clear how best to assign tengwar for
them.</p>

<p>Technically, /dj/ (the unvoiced palato-alveolar affricate) is a
composite in Lojban. This brings up a sticky question; should the
mode ever represent consonent clusters by a single tengwa? Given
the lojban rule of audiovisual isomorphism, there are three
possible answers:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>No. The rule is `one sound, one letter', and all clusters
respresent two distinct sounds, albeit they are slurred together in
speech. Besides, we don't want to make syllabification
difficult.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Maybe. Permissible initial clusters act like single consonants
in one important respect; words may be syllabified that way.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Yes. As long as spelling remains perfectly phonetic (in that
there is only one character sequence corresponding to a given
phoneme sequence) who cares that the written whole might not equal
the sum of its syllabic parts?</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Answer #3 is theoretically defensible, but seems to me to
introduce complexity where there ought not to be any (most
English-speakers are too used to gnarly spelling to appreciate how
frustrating those raised on other tongues find it).</p>

<p>Answer #1 is hard to defend for /dj/ in particular; consider the
English "longjump" (Lojban "*londjymp") which would certainly break
to /lon,djymp/ and not /lond,jymp/. Or Lojban "dadjo" (Tao) which
naturally breaks as /da,djo/, not /dad,jo/ (pronounce it and
see).</p>

<p>Answer #2, then, looks attractive -- until one looks at the
permissible initials and realizes how few of the clusters on it are
as tight as /dj/. Perhaps /ts/, /dz/ and /mr/ might qualify, though
none of them is perceived as a single phoneme in English. None of
these have a single-tengwa representation in any of the Feanorian
modes.</p>

<p>Therefore, we shall construct a simple
one-phoneme-to-one-grapheme mapping. Let's look at the remaining
consonents in this light.</p>

<p>The liquids are the easiest to dispose of. Tolkien says that
27(1/A) was "universally used" for /l/. There are separate signs
21(1/5) and 25(1/8) for trilled and untrilled /r/, which are
allophonic in Lojban; we choose the untrilled 21 because it
resembles the Roman `r' rather than a `y'.</p>

<pre>
LOJBAN: 21(1/5) = /r/, 27(1/A) = /l/
</pre>

<p>The remaining consonants /c/, /f/, /j/, /s/, /v/, /x/, and /z/
are all fricatives or affricates. Note that all but /x/ break
naturally into voiced and unvoiced pairs; /j/, /v/, /z/ versus /c/,
/f/, /s/. The voiced counterpart of the unvoiced velar fricative
/x/ (often rendered as /gh/) occurs neither in Lojban nor
English.</p>

<p>The Tengwar treats these rather inconveniently for Lojban's
purposes. Tolkien describes grades 3 and 4 as unvoiced and voiced
`spirants', an older term for fricatives and affricates (note the
doubling of the bow, indicating voicing, in grade 4).</p>

<p>A simple Westron-like choice of tengwar would imply</p>

<pre>
WESTRON: 10(0/9) = /f/, 11(0/A) = /c/, 14(0/D) = /v/, 15(0/E) = /j/
</pre>

<p>Logically, this system would assign 3(0/2) to an unvoiced
palatal-alveolar stop, something like the `flapped' alveolar t in
English "bottle" (compare the alveolar-dental /t/ in English "tin";
however the flapped alveolar stop is allophonic to dental /t/ or
/d/ in English, Lojban and almost all other languages except
archaic Sanskrit!</p>

<p>Also, the Westron values list no equivalent for Lojban /x/,
which evidently does not occur in the language. Logically, an
unvoiced velar fricative should be Series IV, Grade 3 in the
Westron mode; tengwa 12(0/B). Ironically, this is a better logical
fit to tengwa 12 than the ch sound Tolkien assigns it in the
Westron mode.</p>

<p>Finally, note that Westron and all of Tolkien's other languages
assign the palato-dental fricatives to auxilliary letters 29(1/C)
and 31(1/E).</p>

<pre>
WESTRON: 29(1/C) = /s/, 31(1/E) = /z/.
</pre>

<p>These Westron-like assignments would leave ugly holes in the
tengwar table for Lojban and exile s and z far from their phonetic
brethren. Unfortunately the Quenya use of Series III and IV as k
and kw series would leave us worse off; that mode has no
representations for /c/ or /j/, and the /s/-/z/ pair is also mapped
to 29(1/C) and 31(1/E) there.</p>

<p>The best alternatives are, therefore, to set 12(0/B) = /x/ and
either</p>

<ol>
<li>use the Westron choices for /c/, /f/, /j/, /s/, /v/, and /z/,
or</li>

<li>create a whole new set of assignments for grades 3 and 4 that
dedicates these grades to unvoiced and voiced fricatives/affricates
including /s/ and /z/. This set of assignments might move the
sounds at Grade 3 /c/, /j/ but should preserve the Grade 2 ones so
that they are consistently labials.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now the /s/ and /z/ sounds certainly aren't velar, which would
knock 12-16 out of the running for the /s/-/z/ pair even if 12(0/B)
weren't the logical place to put /x/.</p>

<p>Thus we have basically two choices left:</p>

<pre>
CHOICE1: 9(0/8) = /s/, 13(0/C) = /z/, 11(0/A) = /c/, 15(0/E) = /j/
</pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre>
CHOICE2: 9(0/8) = /c/, 13(0/C) = /j/, 11(0/A) = /s/, 15(0/E) = /z/
</pre>

<p>Either of these is defensible, but choice 1 is a better fit to
Series 1 (/t/, /d/, /s/ and /z/ are all palato-dentals). But notice
that this is the Westron choices with 9(0/8) and 13(0/C)
substituted for 29(1/C) and 31(1/E).</p>

<p>It looks as though we gain little from trying to avoid the
special letters. All this leads me to propose a compromiser's way
out -- let 9(0/8) and 29(1/C) both be legal /s/ characters, with 9
preferred for print and book-hand forms and the simpler 29
available for cursive writing and backward-compatibility with
Elvish (what a concept!).</p>

<p>This completes our set of Lojban consonants. Here are the final
tengwa mappings for reference:</p>

<pre>
LOJBAN: 1(0/0) = /t/, 2(0/1) = /p/, 4(0/3) = /k/, 5(0/4) = /d/, 
LOJBAN: 6(0/5) = /b/, 8(0/7) = /g/, 9(0/8) = /s/, 10(0/9) = /f/
LOJBAN: 11(0/A) = /c/, 12(0/B) = /x/, 15(0/E) = /j/, 17(1/0) = /n/, 
LOJBAN: 18(1/1) = /m/, 21(1/4) = /r/, 27(1/A) = /l/, 29(1/C) = /s/, 
LOJBAN: 31(1/E) = /z/
</pre>

<h1>Lojban Vowels</h1>

<p>Lojbanic vowels are also simpler than those of English and more
like those of Westron or the Elvish languages (in being pure rather
than palatalized). It also helps that there is no long/short vowel
distinction in Lojban.</p>

<p>The first basic decision to make is whether the Lojban mode is
to represent vowels with `tehtar' (diacriticals modifying a
preceding or following consonant) or `full writing' in which the
vowels have separate letters. Both are worth investigating; a
full-writing mode would be easier for character- oriented computer
I/O devices, but tehtar might be more convenient for cursive and
`speed' writing.</p>

<p>We'll tackle the full-writing option first. We need six signs,
for /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/ and the schwa /y/ used in cmene. All of
these occur in the Sindarin inscription on the West-Gate of Moria
in Volume I, though not all are shown in Appendix E. In the `Mode
of Beleriand', then, the vowel letters are:</p>

<dl>
<dt>/a/</dt>

<dd>a curl open to the right (like cursive latin `c'), tengwa
(3/2).</dd>

<dt>/e/</dt>

<dd>tengwa 33(2/0).</dd>

<dt>/i/</dt>

<dd>the `short carrier' tehta (2/5), resembling an undotted
'i'.</dd>

<dt>/o/</dt>

<dd>tengwa 23(1/6).</dd>

<dt>/u/</dt>

<dd>tengwa 36(2/3).</dd>

<dt>/y/</dt>

<dd>tengwa 30(1/D).</dd>
</dl>

<p>These are suitable for Lojbanic use, except that the resemblance
of tengwa 36(2/3) to latin `o' and the zero numeral could cause
confusion. Therefore, let's anticipate an idea from the vowel
tehtar below and agree to use tehta (3/0), a curl open to the left,
for /u/. Coincidentally, this sign is the <em>Tengwar</em> numeral
0.</p>

<p>The usual bindings of the vowel tehtar are also quite
appropriate for Lojban. As vowel endings dominate in Lojban, vowel
tehtar should be written above the preceding letter (this is like
Quenya, but unlike Sindarin, Westron, and English). Since we have
full-letters for vowels and vowel pairs occuring in the language,
let us also allow a tehta to sit above a preceding vowel.</p>

<p>The usual tehtar signs are:</p>

<dl>
<dt>/a/</dt>

<dd>three dots arranged in a triangle, or a circumflex (4/0)</dd>

<dt>/e/</dt>

<dd>an acute accent (4/6)</dd>

<dt>/i/</dt>

<dd>a medial dot (4/4)</dd>

<dt>/o/</dt>

<dd>an acute accent with a terminating downward hook (4/8)</dd>

<dt>/u/</dt>

<dd>a grave accent with a terminating downward hook (4/A)</dd>

<dt>/y/</dt>

<dd>a dot written under the preceding consonent (4/5)</dd>
</dl>

<p>Where there is no immediately preceding letter in Quenya, the
`short carrier' tehta like an undotted `i' (2/5) is placed under
the vowel. Unfortunately, this is ambiguous with the full-letter
use; the grapheme `i' could signify either i-after-lexeme break or
/ii/ depending on whether one were using full-writing or tehtar
vowels. To resolve this, we shall have Lojban use the `long
carrier' instead, a sign like an undotted `j' (2/6).</p>

<p>Dipthongs could of course be written out in full. But a simple
convention would help them appear lexically as the phonemic units
they actually are. I would encourage Lojbanists to write VV
dipthongs as the tehta for the second vowel of the dipthong over
the full vowel for the first (thus /oi/ could be written quickly as
something resembling a script Roman `c' with a dot over it).</p>

<h1>Punctuation</h1>

<p>Next, we need to deal with the Lojbanic peculiarities of smooth
breathing ('), dot, and the /.i/ sentence divider. As it happens,
the Tengwar includes signs for the first and third of these.</p>

<p>In fact, Tolkien gives two signs for smooth breathing. In the
original Quenya of Elvenhome, breath h was written as a simple
raised stroke with no bow, called `halla' (2/4). Later, among the
Exiles, tengwa 33(2/0) came into use. As we use 33(2/0) for
full-written /e/, Lojban must revert to the more archaic high-elven
form.</p>

<p>Orthographically, this might seem to create a problem for use of
tehtar; you can't superimpose vowel tehtar on the halla, so the
vowels on either side must be full-written. But in Lojban this is
actually an advantage -- because vowel pairs separated by smooth
breathing are disyllabic! The halla thus marks a potential syllable
break, and ensures that the tengwar whole word will equal the
concatenation of its syllabic parts.</p>

<p>The /.i/ sentence divider also has an analogue in the Mode of
Beleriand -- the colon-like signs or `double pusta' (5/1) that
bracket the West-Gate inscription and separate phrases in it. This
is not described in the Appendix, but it reflects a common practice
in medieval manuscripts with which Tolkien must have been familiar.
Dan Smith's Tengwar page claims this punctuation is used in all
modes.</p>

<p>Finally, the dot. As it happens, there is an obligatory-pause
symbol in the Tengwar (used among other things to translate
commas). There is also no reason not to simply use a medial dot!
Confusion with the schwa under-dot might be a problem if schwa ever
occurred as a final sound, but it doesn't in Lojban. An initial /i/
dot will always sit on an /i/ full-letter or long carrier,
eliminating that possible confusion as well. The medial dot is
Tolkien's `pusta' (5/0).</p>

<h1>Handling Lojban cmene</h1>

<p>Next we must consider syllabication exceptions in cmene. We need
to invent tengwar equivalents of Lojban capitalization and the
close-comma. Neither exists in any of Tolkien's modes.</p>

<p>Tolkien describes the use of a bar or underline (4/D) to
lengthen consonants. As long and doubled consonents don't occur in
Lojban we can take this over to indicate a nonstandard stress
accent.</p>

<p>For close-comma we can use comma. This is a perfectly reasonable
pseudo-tehta, not confusable with anything (the `long carrier' sign
closest to it would carry a diacritical).</p>

<p>One final cursive-writing trick. We are told that a hook added
to the bow of the last letter in a word (5/C or 5/D) signifies
`following s'. This will be useful in Lojban, especially for cmene
which frequently end in /s/.</p>

<h1>Lojban cmene for the Tengwar themselves</h1>

<p>The Lojban tengwar mode I have described should enable Lojban to
be written more compactly and beautifully than the Roman alphabet
permits (VV-form cmavo, for example, will look like the morphemic
atoms they are). But there is another job to be done; we need to be
able to talk about the Lojban tengwar in Lojban! We need names
and/or predicates for all the constructs above.</p>

<p>We begin easily enough by observing that `tengwar' Lojbanizes
easily to a valid cmene form as `tenguar' or `tenuar' (with /n/ in
its allophonic ng form). The first form is, I think, preferable;
the original tends more toward /teng+gwahr/ than /ten+gwahr/. This
would be the name of the whole letter system.</p>

<p>To avoid constant indirection through lerfu we could coin a
klogi'u `tenga' with place structure "is a tenguar letterform
representing ..." It is not immediately clear whether the gain from
this justifies taking a slot from the CVCCV brivla-space (also the
resemblance to Spanish `tenga' is unfortunate).</p>

<p>Because there are more signs than sounds in the cursive
sub-mode, we also want individual names for the tenguar letterforms
and tehta. Unfortunately, Tolkien's name-list (being based on words
in Quenya) would be inappropriate even if we lojbanized all
names.</p>

<p>Most of the letter tengwar (that is, the non-tehtar characters)
are implicitly named by the lerfu they are equivalent to. So are
some tehta (comma, dot, the the halla sign, and perhaps the
sentence-divider). We need names for the `cursive' /s/ sign,
though, and for the vowel tehtar, vowel carrier, stress underbar,
and following-s hook.</p>

<p>It would also be useful to have Lojban equivalents for `stem'
(Elvish `telco') and `bow' (`luva'), the words used to describe
parts of tengwa; and we want a third coinage for the stroke that
distinguishes Series II and IV from I and III. Finally, we need
collectives for the `letters' and tehta, and some way to refer to
the difference between full-written and cursive tehta-vowel
modes.</p>

<p>One good attack on the problem would start with a series of
tanru describing the tehtar and auxiliary /s/ sign as
abbreviated-tengwa-&lt;foo&gt; where &lt;foo&gt; is a lerfu.
Unfortunately, at this point your humble author knows he is way out
of his depth. Help from any more experienced Lojbanists in building
proper tanru, klogi'u and le'avla to describe the Lojban tenguar
would be greatly appreciated.</p>
