<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Termcap/Terminfo Resources Page.</H1>

I maintain the master database of terminal descriptions from BSD UNIX
(John Kunze of Berkeley, the previous maintainer, handed it to me in
January 1995).<P>

You can download either the <A HREF="termtypes.tc.gz">termcap</A> or
<A HREF="termtypes.ti.gz">terminfo</A> versions of the terminal-type
database from here.  You can also download the <a
href="termtypes.master.gz">master file</a> from which I generate
both.  The current version is 11.0.1.<P> 

If you find you have problems downloading through an interactive
browser such as Netscape's, use <em>wget</em> or some similar batch
tool.  Interactive browsers have been known to screw up gzipped files 
by trying to do incorrect MIME interpretation on them.<P>

<strong>Note:</strong> The termcap version, as distributed, contains some
entries that can core-dump older termcap libraries with a 1024-byte limit.
These are indicated in the file by warning comments.  If the operating
system you are adapting it for has this limit, you must manually remove
these entries.  If you do this, please <strong>note the fact that you have
done so</strong> in the file header.<P>

I keep a separate file of Unidentified Feeping Objects; these are
mystery, obsolescent, and junk entries that were formerly in the
terminfo master.  You can also retrieve this in <A
HREF="ufo.ti.gz">terminfo</A>, <A HREF="ufo.tc.gz">termcap</A>, or <a
href="ufo.master.gz">master</a> format. It's probably only of interest
to antiquarians.<P>

I'm seeking both new entries and better information on old entries for
the terminfo file.  Please read both files with this in mind.  I have
a bunch of <A HREF="questions.html">unanswered questions</A> about
older terminals; if you can settle any of these, please let me
know. <P>

You can find lots of information on terminal switch settings and other things
not covered in the terminfo file at
<A HREF="http://www.cs.utk.edu/~shuford/terminal_index.html">the Shuford
archive</A>.
