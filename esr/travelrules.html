<div id="Content">

<p>Since the Netscape release in March 1998, I have been inundated
with requests to speak at technical conferences, address user
groups, and talk to corporate meetings about the <a
href="http://www.opensource.org">Open Source</a> concept. See my <a
href="speaking.html">calendar of speaking engagements</a> to find
out when I might have time free.</p>

<h1>What I will do</h1>

<p>I'm willing to do all kinds of appearances. Open-source
evangelism is my job now. I'll come to your meeting or presentation
and donate my time. Yes, that's right, I'll do it for free (the
first time, anyway). I accept honoraria, but I don't expect them
and don't want to know about them in advance. I'm not doing this
for money.</p>

<p>If you are not a local Linux user's group, you can make your
request more attractive to me by scheduling a double-header with
the local LUG or university.</p>

<p>In general, I like and will prefer proposals that allow me to do
two or more events on the same out-of-town trip, so please look at
my calendar and be creative. If I'm going to be in a city near you,
consider coordinating with my sponsors to arrange a joint itinerary
and lower costs for everybody.</p>

<p>(I'm free the first time. But if you're a profit-making entity
and you decide you want my time on a regular basis, I'll have to
think up a consulting rate.)</p>

<p>I can give talks or workshops on the following subjects:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The Open Source revolution</strong>: How software
engineering might finally grow up.&lt;'p&gt;</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>The Zen of Unix</strong>: Unix's design as philosophy,
and vice versa.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Freedom, Power, and Software</strong>: What the Internet
teaches us about ethics and politics.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Twenty Years Among the Hackers</strong>: My life as an
accidental ethnographer.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>My standard road show is basically `The Open Source Revolution',
with five modules on (a) the bazaar development model, (b)
socio-anthropology of hacker customs, (c) open source economics and
business models, (d) effective open-source advocacy, (e) a long
strange trip report (my life as an accidental revolutionary). I do
whichever of these modules the audience tells me it wants in the
time available.</p>

<p>I don't use visuals, nor will I require an operating computer
nearby for my talks. I prefer to work without a podium and with a
hand microphone (cordless if possible, lavalieres have poor sound
quality and don't give me volume control). A bare stage is best; I
move around and gesture a lot when I talk. Please also have a
roving microphone available so the audience can ask questions.</p>

<h1>What you need to do</h1>

<p>I don't have a regular income, so I can't afford to let these
trips cost me money. Also, I hate sweating details and filling out
expense forms. So you need to cover my travel and lodging expenses,
and I want you to do it so I never have to lay out cash or fill out
forms. (Also please bear in mind that I do not have a credit card.
This is deliberate; I value my privacy.)</p>

<p>If there's air travel involved, I want my plane fare prepaid and
prebooked. If there's a hotel stay needed I want the room tab
guaranteed, incidentals and meals and all (no chintzy
base-rate-plus-tax-only stuff; I loathe having to argue with the
front desk).</p>

<p>Let me emphasize that last, because conference organizers seem
to have trouble following through on this. If I am asked for a
credit card at checkin time, <em>you have screwed up</em>. Don't
screw up, or I won't come back.</p>

<p>If you're a cash-strapped user's group or small startup company,
I'm a cheap date &mdash; economy class and space on somebody's daybed,
or half of an inexpensive hotel room, will do fine.</p>

<p>If you're a big company or a conference that charges admission,
I expect you to pony up for business class or first class (so my
travel exhaustion will be minimized) and I don't ever want to have
to even look at the hotel bill. I don't use booze or have any other
expensive tastes I can gratify on the road, so you don't have to
worry about a bar tab or anything like that.</p>

<p>If you want me to be in the air for longer than four hours, you
have to pay for business or first class no matter who you are. This
rule is a function of the battery life of my laptop; the expensive
classes have DC power connectors...</p>

<p>(My rules for who gets the cheap options used to be looser until
a user's group put me through the special hell that is a
twenty-two-hour Philadelphia-to-Melbourne run in economy class.
Never again.)</p>

<p>Finally, I've been in way too many situations now where the
people who want me to fly in either don't follow through or
casually assume I will make my own arrangements and apply for
reimbursement afterwards. Too often, this means they don't bother
to communicate with me about logistics until very near the event.
This sort of behavior adds a a thousand tiny hassles to my travel
schedule, and it's already tough when everybody is cooperating
well.</p>

<p>Therefore: if you don't know at least a week before your event
that I have a confirmed flight booked, you may assume I won't show
up. It is <em>your</em> responsibility to to make sure there is a
travel plan that that I have agreed to and that any other
organizations involved in the trip have been briefed about.</p>

<p>I don't have a secretary, I don't have a staff. There's just me,
and seemingly half the population of the planet wants a piece of my
time. Please act on the assumption that I have zero time to think
about making travel arrangements.</p>

<p>Finally, I've found it saves many hassles if I have a local
cellphone number for the people who are delegated to meet me at the
airport or other transit terminus. This makes it easier to recover
from schedule slips and problems choosing the wrong meeting
point.</p>

<h1>Special notes for overseas trips</h1>

<p>If you're outside the U.S., please try to scare up a cellphone
you can lend me during your visit. I've found that it's very
helpful to both myself and event organizers when they know they can
reach me even if I go off sightseeing.</p>

<p>Also, if you're outside the U.S., please budget a little
walking-around money for me in the local currency. It doesn't have
to be a lot, just enough for a few taxi fares and a meal or two.
This too tends to simplify life for everyone and give me some
flexibility in case of miscommunications and schedule slipups.</p>

<p>If your audience does not speak English, be aware that serial
translation plays hell with my speaking style and I find it
extremely stressful. The problem with it is twofold. One, my
speaking style is fluid and discursive; it doesn't take well to
being broken up into short serial chunks. Two, my English is
idiomatic, allusive, and complex. If you don't hire translators
good enough to do simultaneous translation, the audience is going
to lose a lot of the content anyway, so serial translation is
really false economy.</p>

<p>So when you propose a talk to a non-English-speaking audience,
you must tell me what kind of translation you're going to set up &mdash;
and be aware that serial translation will probably count heavily
enough against your proposal to scuttle it unless I have other
special reasons for wanting to do your event.</p>

<p>(Sorry about this, but I've learned it's good policy through
repeated bad experiences.)</p>

<h1>Why these rules exist, and how they may change</h1>

<p>I don't make these rules out of a love of luxury. I make them in
order to keep my life simple and economize on my time, so I can
stay focused on the issues and ideas that make me valuable to
you.</p>

<p>These rules will probably change in the future. I'm getting
enough requests to travel on these terms that I'm on the road about
half the time (and it could easily be full time). At the rate
requests are increasing, I will soon have to be far more selective
than I have been up to now.</p>

<p>When I change the rules, it will be by requiring a stiff
per-diem from for-profit groups and conferences that charge
admission. Conditions for small LUGs and universities that are not
charging admission for my talks will remain unaffected.</p>

<p>The idea behind the per-diem fee wouldn't be to make money per
se but to separate the expensive conferences that attract powerful
people from the marginal events where the hacker community would
get less leverage from my presence.</p>

<h1>A Reminder to Conference Organizers</h1>

<p>If I am asked for a credit card at hotel checkin time, <em>you
have screwed up</em>. This is the most common error I run into, but
at the end of a long plane flight it still makes me rather angry
every time. I put myself to considerable trouble to come to your
event, without charging for my time; in return, the least you can
do is get this detail right. Please make <em>certain</em> the hotel
knows you are covering my incidentals.</p>
