<h1 class="c1">Welcome to the Trove project</h1>

<p>The Trove project is an attempt to create an open-source
distributed archiving system for use at large software archive
sites. The project is currently in a pre-alpha design phase.</p>

<p>There is now a consolidated design document which describes the
project objectives, history, plans, and implementation tactics. You
can download the <a href="trove-design.sgml">SGML master</a>, or <a
href="trove-design.html">browse HTML</a>.</p>

<p>The project has a developers' list, <a
href="http://www.python.org/mailman/listinfo/trove-dev/">Trove-Dev</a>.
Contributors will be welcomed, anyone with real-world experience in
developing Web-accessible databases especially so.</p>

<p>You can look at the draft <a href="schema">schema</a> for Trove
databases.</p>

<p>You can download a <a href="trove-0.08.tar.gz">gzipped tar</a>
of the embryo Trove code. It's written in Python.</p>

<p>There is a list of <a href="trove-faq.html">Frequently Asked
Questions</a> about Trove. Please read this before posting to the
Trove list.</p>

<p>There is a page describing <a href="trove-tasks.html">tasks</a>
needing to be done and whoi has volunteered for them.</p>

<p>You can view the <a href="sample.html">form</a> generated by
this code. Currently it does nothing.</p>

<h1>Recent News</h1>

<p>(ESR) The trovesend submission tool can now use PGP 2.6.2 as
well as 5.0</p>

<p>(ESR) The file archive.py now contains a working service module
for manipulating a Trove archive directory structure. The module
can be verifed with an interactive test harness.</p>

<p>(ESR) Resource-Location and Icon-Location fields are no longer
(replica|original|attached). Instead they are now archive-local
filenames for the resource to be copied to. If present, they imply
'replica' or `attached' status; which is which can be told by
whether there is a matching attachment or not. This change enables
maintainers to create topic subdirectories under the package
directory.</p>

<p>(ESR) The Python code has been updated for Python 1.52. Soon, I
hope, other people will be able to send in accomplishments to add
to this list. There's a bit more design and documentation work that
I'll need to do first to lay groundwork, though.</p>

<p>Specifically, I need to produce a working shovel implementation
that does proper updates on a local archive tree. Once we have
that, other people can start plugging in database layers and
developing the query side.</p>

<h1>Trove and Python</h1>

<p>The implementation language of the Trove project is <a
href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>, an extremely cool and
totally free rapid-prototyping and scripting language. Python's
designer, Guido Van Rossum, is on the Trove development list.</p>

<p>Where possible, code needed to support Trove's goals is being
implemented as enhancements for the Python standard environment and
fed back to Guido for use in the next release. Here's <a
href="python.html">what we've contributed so far</a>.</p>
