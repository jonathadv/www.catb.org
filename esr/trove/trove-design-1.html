<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Why Trove?</A>
</H2>

<P>The `classical' model of Internet software archive (exemplified by 
<A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu">Sunsite</A>, WWW frosting on an FTP
cake) is no longer adequate to the increasing size and evolutionary
speed of the open-source community.  It eats too much maintainer time;
the classification/search mechanisms are woefully weak; and the
package namespace has no collision detection.
<P>One of us (Eric Raymond) had been Sunsite's principal maintainer
for more than a year before Trove got started.  Eric wrote the 
<A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/search">keeper</A> tool, which does about
as good a job as possible of automating away the scutwork under the
present system.  It's not good enough.  The amount of maintainer time
Sunsite requires is rising to the point where the archive is not
sustainable. On present trends, Eric thinks Sunsite's system (or its
maintainers) will collapse by the end of 1998.
<P>Some prominent Python people (including Ken Manheimer, Andrew
Kuchling, and Guido Van Rossum) had realized for a while they were
facing similar problems in the future of the Python archive, and begun
discussing a redesign they thought of as the `locator' project.
<P>
<P>The concept of the Trove project was originally floated by Eric
Raymond in early April 1998.  Within a week, he was approached by
Guido van Rossum about joining forces.  By the end of April, when the
project and the Trove web pages were officially launched, principals
included Ken Manheimer and Andrew Kuchling of the Python Software
Activity. Ken Manheimer proposed the name `Trove'.  John Cowan
provided valuable expertise in database design and IR pragmatics.

</H2>

<P>For purposes of this document, a <EM>resource</EM> is a file such as a
source or binary archive, an RPM or Debian installable package, a
documentat, etc.  A resource may have associated <EM>metadata</EM>
(such as a description of the resource).
<P>Related resources will be grouped into a <EM>package</EM>, which will
have associated metadata of its own (including but not limited to
author's name, the project home page location, etc.).
<P>The metadata exists to provide a handle on packages and resources,
making them discoverable through searching and browsing facilities.
Resources may have associated metadata of their own
<P>A <EM>search</EM> is any selection operation that returns a subset of
the archive metadata.
<P>A <EM>site ring</EM> is a collection of Trove sites that mirror each
others' metadata (so that a search of any is effectively a search of all).
