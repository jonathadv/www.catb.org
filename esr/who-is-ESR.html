<p>So who is this ESR character, anyway?</p>

<p>I wonder that myself, sometimes.  This page is written for the benefit
of anyone who may have stumbled on this website without having previously
tripped over my public Famous Internet Geek persona.</p>

<br /> <p>I'm a long-time hacker, active in the Internet culture since
the 1970s, who got unexpectedly famous in the late 1990s as a result
of events I have <a
href='/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/hacker-revenge/'>described
elsewhere</a> &mdash; like the song goes, it took me twenty years to
become an overnight sensation.  I either founded or re-invented
(depending on who you ask, and how some history is interpreted; I
prefer &lsquo;re-invented&rsquo;, myself) the <a
href="http://www.opensource.org/">open source movement</a>.  If that
term means nothing to you, think Linux.  Linux is the open-source
community's flagship product.</p>

<p>Today I'm one of the half-dozen or so most influential people in that
movement; in fact, a lot of people would put me among the top three, with
Linus Torvalds and Richard M. Stallman.  The community has a tradition of 
tri-letterizing its heroes &mdash; I suppose that began with Stallman, already
a hero when I was a fledgling programmer in the early 1980s, who was generally
known as RMS even then.  Linus Torvalds is just &lsquo;Linus&rsquo;, perhaps
because (unlike &lsquo;Richard&rsquo; or &lsquo;Eric&rsquo;) one can refer
to him by simply first name with very little risk of aliasing problems.</p>

<p>I think I started to be routinely triletterized into
&lsquo;ESR&rsquo; around 1998 on <a
href='http://slashdot.org'>Slashdot</a>; that was a few months after
the fame thing started to kick in seriously.  It's at best a mixed
blessing.  Fame is tactically useful, but the pressures and
expectations that go with it can be nasty stuff. I have written at
more length about the problem in <a
href="/~esr/writings/take-my-job-please.html">Take My Job, Please!</a></p>

<br />

<p>If you want to learn more about me, browsing through my 
<a href="/~esr/writings/">essays</a> would be a good place to start.</p>
