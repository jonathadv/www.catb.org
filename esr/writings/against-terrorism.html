<p class='notebox'>I wrote this on September 11th, 2001, hours after learning
that the World Trade Center had been destroyed, with thousands of
lives lost, by terrorists who hijacked two jetliners using carpet
knives.</p>

<br />

<p>Some friends have asked me to step outside my normal role as a
technology evangelist today, to point out in public that a
political panic reaction to the 9/11 terrorist attack could do a
great deal more damage than the attack itself.</p>

<p>Today will not have been a victory for terrorism unless we make
it one. If we reward in any way the Palestinians who are now
celebrating this hideous crime in the streets of the West Bank,
that wil have been a victory for terrorism. If we accept
"anti-terrorism" measures that do further damage to our
Constitutional freedoms, that will have been a victory for
terrorism. But if we learn the right lessons, if we make policies
that preserve freedom and offer terrorists no result but a rapid
and futile death, that will have been a victory for the rest of
us.</p>

<p>We have learned today that airport security is not the answer.
At least four separate terror teams were able to sail right past
all the elaborate obstacles -- the demand for IDs, the metal
detectors, the video cameras, the X-ray machines, the gunpowder
sniffers, the gate agents and security people trained to spot
terrorists by profile. There have been no reports that any other
terror units were successfully prevented from achieving their
objectives by these measures. In fact, the early evidence is that
all these police-state-like impositions on freedom were exactly
useless -- and in the smoldering ruins of the World Trade Center
lies the proof of their failure.</p>

<p>We have learned today that increased surveillance is not the
answer. The FBI's "Carnivore" tap on the U.S.'s Internet service
providers didn't spot or prevent this disaster; nor did the NSA's
illegal Echelon wiretaps on international telecommunications. Video
monitoring of public areas could have accomplished exactly nothing
against terrorists taking even elementary concealment measures. If
we could somehow extend airport-level security to the entire U.S.,
it would be just as useless against any determined and even
marginally competent enemy.</p>

<p>We have learned today that trying to keep civilian weapons out
of airplanes and other areas vulnerable to terrorist attack is not
the answer either -- indeed, it is arguable that the lawmakers who
disarmed all the non-terrorists on those four airplanes, leaving
them no chance to stop the hijackers, bear part of the moral
responsibility for this catastrophe.</p>

<p>I expect that in the next few months, far too many politicians
and pundits will press for draconian "anti-terrorist" laws and
regulations. Those who do so will be, whether intentionally or not,
cooperating with the terrorists in their attempt to destroy our way
of life -- and we should all remember that fact come election
time.</p>

<p>As an Internet technologist, I have learned that distributed
problems require distributed solutions -- that centralization of
power, the first resort of politicians who feed on crisis, is
actually worse than useless, because centralizers regard the more
effective coping strategies as threats and act to thwart them.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is too much to hope that we will respond to this
shattering tragedy as well as the Israelis, who have a long history
of preventing similar atrocities by encouraging their civilians to
carry concealed weapons and to shoot back at criminals and
terrorists. But it is in that policy of a distributed response to a
distributed threat, with every single citizen taking personal
responsibility for the defense of life and freedom, that our best
hope for preventing recurrences of today's mass murders almost
certainly lies.</p>

<p>If we learn that lesson, perhaps today's deaths will not have
been in vain.</p>
