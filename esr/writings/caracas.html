<p class="c2"><strong class="c1">Fear and Loathing in
Caracas</strong></p>

<p class="c2"><em>...a Bemused Journey Into the Heart of the South
American Dream</em></p>

<p>I am sitting in the lobby of a tropical hotel. The night outside
is perfumed, alive with crickets and latin jazz. Shortly, I am
expecting a beautiful and mysterious woman who says she is a
journalist to take me out into the barrios. I'm remembering the
last time she kissed me, and wondering what dangers and excitements
lie ahead. There are five hundred dollars of easy money in my
pocket. I'm wearing a fedora and a semiautomatic pistol. I'm a man
on a mission, and the night beckons.</p>

<p>On that April night in 1998, my life was imitating bad art. This
is how it happened...</p>

<p>About three months previously I'd gotten an invitation to speak
at a technical conference in Caracas, Venezuela; ``Visionarios
2000''. They wanted to hear my rap on open-source software
development, Linux, the Internet hacker culture, etcetera. All
expenses paid.</p>

<p>I accepted. I'd lived in Venezuela once as a small child, for
four years in the early 1960s, but I have almost no memories of the
place. I thought it would be interesting to go back. See the
country, and reclaim a bit of my personal past.</p>

<p>I'd spoken at a lot of technical conferences since <a
href="http://~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar">The Cathedral and the
Bazaar</a> started to make waves in mid-1997. My first clue that
this one was going to be a bit unusual was the note at the bottom
of my emailed itinerary asking me how many pieces of luggage I was
bringing, so they'd know what size van to send to the airport.</p>

<p>While this sort of thing may be S.O.P. for the power-suited
high-rollers who speak at business conventions, it's hardly the
norm for U.S. technical conferences. They (or at least the ones
I've been going to) tend to want you to take your own ground
transport in and then jump through hoops to get reimbursement. Some
suggestion of more money than usual behind these proceedings, I was
thinking as my plane touched down.</p>

<p>It was a little after midnight local time. As I pulled my
backpack off the checked-baggage carousel, I was feeling a little
nervous about the cased Colt .45 ACP and magazines inside it. In
the thirty-five years since I'd last seen the place, Venezuela had
had coups or coup attempts more often than most of the local
politicos got around to changing their underwear. On top of that, I
don't even trust <em>American</em> police to protect my life; no
way I was going to rely on third-world cops. And no way was I going
to truck around unarmed in Grahame Greene country. But this meant
one inquisitive customs inspector could have ruined my whole
day.</p>

<p>I needn't have worried. Customs was a joke; they waved me
through without even eyeballing my passport. Three smiling Latins
with a sign reading ``Erick Raymond'' were waiting just beyond,
wearing dark suits and radio headsets. They hustled me and my
backpack into a van. As we rolled out of the airport, I realized
two things: (a) their English was as rudimentary as my Spanish, and
(b) I had no real idea what I was doing here.</p>

<p>Not that I wasn't ready to give my talk. Public speaking does
not faze me in the least; I can extemporize at any desired length
on any topic I know well enough to write about. No, the problem was
that I had no idea why this particular audience wanted to hear me
rave. The focus of the conference was not clear. My invitation,
while clearly intended to be flattering, had been nearly
incomprehensible as well. The conference Web page was no more
enlightening. Zero-content rhetoric about ``challenges of the
information age'' is, it seems, a genre that transcends language
barriers.</p>

<p>My first day in, Tuesday, wasn't much help. The conference staff
were clearly too busy setting up to bother with me, so I took a
walk.</p>

<p>The view of Caracas one gets from just outside the Hilton is
irresistibly allegorical. You're in the heart of the capitol, the
showpiece of Venezuelan development. Around you, lush tropical
plants and heavy traffic. Crowds of good-looking copper-skinned
people milling around ugly thirty-year-old International-Style
buildings. On the hills around us, the squatter towns loom like a
wave forever about to break.</p>

<p>Those people. One of the fascinating things about Venezuela is
their mix of racial types, signature of a population that's been
cheerfully mixing germ plasm for nearly twice as long as the U.S.
has existed. You see a few extremes from nearly Swedish-looking
blonds to dark-skinned blacks, but the typical
middle-of-the-bell-curve Venezuelan isn't quite like anything in
American experience. Not even like American hispanics; there's more
Indio blood, reddish skin, high cheekbones. The men are handsome,
though they tend to have bad complexions. The women are gorgeous,
dark-eyed beauties with glossy raven hair down to here who'd look
right at home with roses in their teeth. Many of them wear
miniskirts and spike heels on the street with a sexy innocence
American women can no longer muster.</p>

<p>In that and in other ways Caracas reminds me eerily of an
American city in the 1960s. I see chrome trim on the cars. Before
you notice that the buildings are decaying, the skyline looks
exactly like some chirpy period Life-magazine spread on the triumph
of modern architecture. Even the music...punk and grunge have not
touched this place. These people haven't got time for angst.</p>

<p>Back at the hotel, some order is beginning to emerge from the
pre-conference chaos. Huge `Visionarios 2000' banners have been
hung throughout the hotel. In the lobby, I am introduced to an
astonishingly lovely young woman named Elssie Chavez who is, I am
told, my personal translator. Her English is excellent. She is one
of a platoon of navy-suited usherettes who, I will soon discover,
have been hired to stand around doing little more than looking
decorative. (Elssie assures me that they make excellent money doing
this; several, as it turns out, are moonlighting from a local
modeling agency.)</p>

<p>Unbeknownst to me, the introduction scene is being watched by
two Americans, who accost me a few minutes later when I return to
the lobby alone. They're engineers with a U.S. telecoms firm. ``So,
is this an Internet conference, or what?'' one asks. I explain as
much as I know, but they don't seem very interested...until the
second one admits that what they really want to know is how I
surrounded myself with so many beautiful women.</p>

<p>As I grope for some witty answer I realize two things: I really
<em>had</em> been surrounded by beautiful women back there (not
just Elssie), and this could never happen in the U.S. because our
conferences don't hire moonlighting models as gofers. I decide I
like the Latin way better, though a bright girl like Elssie seems
underemployed at it. I'll use this story as a joke to lead my talk
with Thursday morning.</p>

<p>I check in at the speaker's desk and am further astonished to be
handed five hundred dollars American, two bills and three
traveler's checks. If I turned this into the local currency the wad
would choke a camel. I could live on it for three months in this
city. What's going on here?</p>

<p>That night I begin to see some answers. The conference opens
with a speech and, of all things, a performance by a children's
choir. The kids are as cute as a box of kittens (I teach Elssie
this expression). They're singing a kind of Latin pop I've never
heard an Anglo equivalent of -- not quite folk, not quite jazz, not
quite rock, very catchy, very pretty. Still, the whole thing comes
across more like a PR display than anything else, and though I
didn't understand the speech something about the cadence was
familiar. I have somehow managed to stumble into a political
event.</p>

<p>The concert segues into an elaborate buffet/party in the Grand
Salon. White-jacketed waiters are circulating with trays of drinks
among men in power suits and women in velvet gowns. I am introduced
to a Minister of Education. Gradually it dawns on me that I am
rubbing shoulders with the Venezuelan elite. And that Visionarios
2000, at least for them, is less about the exchange of ideas than
it is about the celebration of national power.</p>

<p>And I am beginning to understand my appointed role. A few
academics and technical people will care what I have to say, but
for most of the attendees it would hardly signify if I stood on my
head and spoke in Urdu. I'm here for my value as an exotic; my
blue-eyed American presence has been solicited to lend tone to the
affair. Earnest Latins shake my hand and peer into my face as
though to discover what ineffable spark makes a First-Worlder
run.</p>

<p>Safely hidden by the mask they have hung on me, I go into full
alien-anthropologist mode. My childhood Spanish is beginning to
come back a bit. I circulate. I learn a lot from the questions they
ask me and the job titles they politely ask me if I match. One of
the things I learn is there seems to be no native hacker culture at
all here!</p>

<p>That means more than you'd think. I've talked with hackers in
Warsaw. Even there, just recovering from forty years of life in the
Soviet bloc, there's some concept that you can choose your place in
the system, or choose (with some effort) to stand partway outside
it. In the U.S. we have lots of hackers like me because it's
relatively easy to cut partway loose from the scarcity-economics
game and define your own individual niche based on what you
<em>want</em> to do. In Poland this is harder to accomplish,
because everyone is poorer and has to spend more time chasing food
and rent, but at least they understand the concept. So there is a
Polish hacker culture, though not a large one.</p>

<p>Venezuela is a much wealthier country than Poland, but the men
and women in that ballroom displayed no Polish understanding at
all. As I tried to explain what I did and why, I learned that the
only labels in their model of the world that fit me were
`consultor' and `independiente'. It became clear that these have
even stronger connotations of `hired gun' than they do in English.
And, revealingly, the noun `independiente' doesn't take any
modifiers or specifiers -- as though, have said one is outside the
corporate or government ambit, there are no other distinctions
worth making.</p>

<p>Of course I'd read all the angry descriptions of South American
politics, the immorality tales of smug and corrupt oligarchies
lording it over masses of peasants and campesinos. What I met in
the Grand Salon was subtler and sadder than that -- people who know
they're big frogs in a small pond, looking for a way to a bigger
one but blinkered by their own inability to imagine an unstratified
society of independent peers.</p>

<p>My education in Venezuelan psychopolitics was interrupted by
meeting a few English-speakers; notably, Muriel Oaks and Skip Green
of GTE's distance-learning group. I believe it was Muriel, a petite
but formidable woman of indeterminate age who I took to
immediately, who cleared up one minor mystery -- the source of
certain strange noises that assaulted the Hilton ground floor in
the evening.</p>

<p>These noises were random, loud chirping sounds. What puzzled me
is their oddly pure, electronic-sounding timbre, as though a whole
pile of personal beepers and digital watches were going into
continuous epileptic short-out mode. Birds? Frogs? Insects? Turns
out it was crickets. <em>Loud</em> crickets. Even Texas ain't got
crickets like these.</p>

<p>Wednesday morning. The conference's TCP/IP network is up. The
day's talks seem mostly to do with politics and regulation, and
there are open machines in the press room. I descend on one
hungrily and spend much of the day catching up on nearly three
days' accumulation of back mail. I have nearly forgotten the gun I
am carrying; the way I have it concealed is very hard to spot
unless you know exactly where and what to look for, and I'm used to
the weight.</p>

<p>Wednesday lunch is catered in the Grand Salon. I get to chat
with the man who wrote the exceptionally tortured English in my
invitation letter, a Swiss-German emigre named Andreas Meier who
teaches at Simon Bolivar University. His spoken English is much
better. In person he looks classically Teutonic but has the easy
manner and voluble body language of a Venezuelan; ``I am not a
typical Swiss,'' he accurately notes. He hints that I will soon
meet a native Venezuelan hacker, managing to imply that the man is
just as <i>sui generis</i> as Andreas himself.</p>

<p>I spend most of that lunch talking with Andreas's boss, a
semiretired mathematical logician and university administrator,
Hector somebody whose last name I never catch. His interests in
formal systems theory parallel some remembered preoccupations of
mine from my student days. We have a lively and interesting
discussion. Then he begins to tell me about his attempts to apply
mathematical analysis to the sociology of Venezuela. His projection
of the future is rather bleak. He thinks Venezuela's climate and
resources have been too kind to humans, never giving them any
incentive to build the self-discipline or stock of skills needed to
generate wealth once the extractive industries have played out.</p>

<p>I already know that Venezuela's economy floats on cheap oil. I
know that the easily taxable wealth from extractive industries in
the Third World has actually retarded broad-based modernization by
encouraging corrupt, lazy and brutal political regimes. What I've
never seen before is how this process looks from the point of view
of a member of the local power elite who's too honest to blink.
This is fascinating!</p>

<p>The U.S.'s culture is so imbued with Weberian virtue that we
take our own ability to make money in any kind of physical
environment for granted -- so we don't think much about
natural-resource stocks or climate as a determinant of national
character. The professor, steeped in Venezuelan history, sees great
significance in the fact that Venezuela has <em>always</em> made
its wealth from extractive industries (hardwoods, copper, oil)
rather than agriculture or industry. And the requisites for
survival in Venezuela's temperate tropical climate with abundant
wild foods have been light -- proverbially, a hammock and a
poncho.</p>

<p>To the professor, the post-WWII oil boom (and inevitable bust)
is just the latest cycle in an old story. The land is too good to
its people, so the people are lazy. They never grow the social
maturity, thrift, or civic virtue to handle crisis and deprivation.
As a result, Venezuela remains a fool's paradise run by
kleptocrats, its long lazy tropical dreams occasionally interrupted
by racking fever as it hunts up the next extractive fix.</p>

<p>If the professor's dissection of his own country is pitiless,
his prognosis for the U.S. is hardly kinder. He admires the
American achievement, but believes we have become so used to wealth
that we are forgotting the virtues that made us wealthy. When we
exhaust the natural wealth of the U.S. (he projects) we will crash.
There are obvious holes in his economics, but when I consider the
squalid mess our politics and media have become the charge suddenly
seems hard to refute.</p>

<p>I take time out that afternoon to teach Elssie some American
slang and dialectology. She soaks it up like a sponge and tells me
in return stories about learning English in Montreal. My estimate
of her IQ was never low and it's rising. The fact that she can't
find a better way to make money than playing usherette is beginning
to seriously bother me; is this the individual human cost of the
professor's trends? I feel glad that I can at least make her laugh
a lot by imitating American and British regional accents.</p>

<p>Wednesday night I treat Muriel Oaks to dinner at the hotel
restaurant, courtesy of the conference organizers who don't seem
like they'll mind a few extra bucks on the room tab. She too has
noticed that the conference is something of a dog-and-pony show. We
shrug. There are worse fates than to be here.</p>

<p>Thursday morning I give my talk. It goes well by my usual metric
-- that is, the audience laughs when it's supposed to and doesn't
when it isn't. Afterwards, I go to some other talks. I listen
(through simultaneous translation) to a professor from Peru who has
been statistically analyzing the content of the Web, estimating
things like the document size distribution and the dispersion of
the link structure. I hear Larry Press's talk about estimates of
international penetration of the net. And I hear Skip Green give a
fascinating presentation on patterns of success and failure in
distance learning.</p>

<p>Thursday lunch is again catered in the Grand Salon. It's delayed
for some time because a politician is making a speech to reporters
where we're supposed to be eating. We wait for some more time, and
nobody is surprised. I have already observed that the `manana'
attitude is not just a travel-book cliche; the conference schedule
has been continuously running a half hour or more late.</p>

<p>I find my way to the one table full of English-speakers. Andreas
is there; so is Larry Press. A big jovial Irishman named Pat
O'Callaghan, who moderated audience questions at my talk, is
sitting to my right. He too teaches at the University. We swap
stories about his home country and hit it off famously (he is
visibly pleased when I tell him I am part Irish). To my left, a
face I don't know turns out to belong to Andreas's mysterious
hacker. Aha! His name is Leonardo Mauro and he tells me of having
spent much time in the U.S., until (as he put it) ``I woke up in a
hotel and realized I didn't know what city I was in. Then I
realized it is time to go home.''</p>

<p>We talk of many things. Though I don't mention the professor's
bleak analysis, Leonardo seconds it from a different angle. When I
wonder why Elssie can't get a better job, he says ``Things are
getting very bad here. We used to have a middle class, but it's
been destroyed.'' ``By taxes?'' I ask, thinking of the U.S. ``No,''
he replies, ``Corruption.''</p>

<p>The picture Leo paints is even bleaker than the professor's.
According to him, the Venezuelan upper class has become as closed
in on itself as the old Soviet nomenklatura. The most important
currency is not money but influence. If you are part of the charmed
circle, you can get anything. Outside it, there is nothing. Bright
young people like Elssie quickly conclude that their best strategy
is to get as well-educated as possible and leave the country --
which of course makes the underlying problem worse.</p>

<p>I remember shaking hands with the elite the previous night and
wonder if the Soviet bloc's nomenklatura looked as sad and trapped
in its day before the Berlin Wall came down. I want somehow to get
out of the hotel, make contact with the real city. Everybody I've
talked to so far has been within Leo's charmed circle, hating the
system perhaps but part of it. But how? The conference organizers
have been munificent in many ways but apparently it never occurred
to them that I might want to see Caracas itself. My Spanish is
rudimentary, I'm an alien here. The mask they have put on me is
beginning to chafe.</p>

<p>I speculate on trying to find my way out to a jazz club or
street musicians. Leo is no help; a classic introverted hacker
type, he'd be a fish out of water in that kind of street scene. Ah
well, we speak of many other things, trading war stories of Unix
versions fifteen years gone. We hang out together after lunch and I
ask him about the local firearms laws. They are draconian, it
seems. Uh oh. I evade his obvious next question and slip away to
catch up on my email again and consider what I've learned.</p>

<p>That night it's ``Andy Duran's Big Band'' in the Grand Salon,
putting a syncopated Latin spin on ``Little Brown Jug'' and ``Take
the A Train''. I like them better when they start in on ``Oye Como
Va'' and salsa music. The party begins to really hop. A tall blonde
woman on the conference staff, grown a bit tipsy, takes my arm and
confides ``You are very pretty'', not a sentiment I'm much used to
hearing back home. Andreas, apparently single, has joked in my
presence that Venezuelan women keep him here. Perhaps they have a
cultural thing for blue-eyed men?</p>

<p>I watch, chatting with Elssie, as the South Americans do all
those things you think are just movie cliches -- limbo dancing,
conga lines. Gradually I drift over to the bandstand and just
absorb the music, swaying happily as the conga drums pound. The
band's manager spots an opportunity and presses a card into my
hand, urging me to take the band to America.</p>

<p>They're seriously good. My fingers begin itching for my flute. A
woman asks me to dance. She's attractive, petite, curly-haired, one
of the copper-skinned mestizas in the middle of Venezuela's
phenotypic bell curve. I'm not very good at the local dance steps
but she doesn't seem to mind and smiles at me a lot. Afterwards I
watch Elssie and the usherettes dancing wild tangos with one of the
headphone-wearers from my van trip. He takes them all on, one by
one. He's really good. Elssie tells me he's the boss.</p>

<p>After a while I can't stand it any more and go upstairs for my
flute. I play a just a bit for Elssie and fade back into a corner
to warm up and get used to the band's groove, but it is not to be.
The band's manager twigs to what I'm doing, laughs, and clues in
her friends. A small mob of excited Latins, including the tipsy
blonde woman, literally pushes me onto the bandstand. The band is
cool with this; Andy Duran waves me to the front mike and we rip
into about three minutes of torrid salsa jamming. By the time we're
done I'm soaked with sweat and the crowd is cheering and stamping.
I stumble off stage; a wide-eyed local shakes my hand and demands
"Where the hhhhell did <em>that</em> come from?" I'm delighted; I
have blown off the mask.</p>

<p>I'm still wired as the party breaks up. Wandering through the
lobby towards my room, I see the woman who asked me to dance
chatting with another conference attendee. She invites me to join
them. He is Luis, a physician from Peru; she is Diana, a graphics
designer with a local newspaper. We relocate to the hotel
restaurant and talk of many things well into the night, amused at
each others' attempts to cross the language barriers, comparing our
home countries, evaluating the conference. It is the kind of
conversation that makes friendships.</p>

<p>Diana is vivacious. She and Luis tease me into speaking more
Spanish, and she compliments me on my pronunciation, which she says
is much better than her English. She thinks it is a terrible shame
that Luis and I have barely been out of the hotel, and promises to
take us to a live-music club tomorrow, Friday night, where I can
maybe get into another jam session.</p>

<p>We have to leave when they close down the restaurant. Diana hugs
and kisses me goodbye, a gesture I have observed is relatively
common between friends of the opposite sex here. But I also notice
that she only hugs Luis.</p>

<p>Friday morning, last day of the conference. I'm on a panel with
Leo Mauro, Larry Press, Andreas, and two corporate droids from
Oracle Venezuela. The topic is ``The future of open software''.
Leo, bless his pure hacker heart, talks too long and too
technically. The droids are clearly struggling. Larry asks
intelligent questions that we never have time to explore. I try to
keep it short and end up sounding downright laconic amidst the
flows of baroque Spanish from four of the six participants. The
panel is not, I fear, a huge success.</p>

<p>The convention is breaking down; it officially ends at noon with
a reprise by the children's choir. Elssie finds me and hugs me
goodbye. I wish her well.</p>

<p>Afterwards Diana finds me in the press room as I am catching up
yet again on my email. She kisses me warmly, promises to return
that night for our expedition into the city, and vanishes. I start
working on my next research paper, ``The Magic Cauldron''. Today's
scheduled talks don't seem very interesting, but there's plenty of
work I can do over a telnet. And I do, until they shut down the
conference's network at about three in the afternoon. I'm the last
person off.</p>

<p>I wander over to the exhibit area, where I find Muriel Oaks
running a distance-learning demonstration. It's the first time I've
seen full videoconferencing, and I find the compression delay kind
of eerie. Muriel offers to take me to dinner, but I explain about
Diana's expedition and that I'm not sure when she'll show.</p>

<p>And then I get a surprise; Elssie is back, and she's brought me
a present -- a touristy Caracas T-shirt, and a couple of pins and a
bumper sticker. Her brother wants my email address. She says I've
been nice to work with, and we hug with less restraint this time. I
watch her walk away, hoping she'll get somehow to make a life in
her own country.</p>

<p>I buy a couple of magazines (spending money for the first time
since I landed in Caracas) and go back to my room to wait for
Diana. I finish the magazines, wander down to the lobby, and it is
at that point that I realize my life is imitating bad art. And not
just bad art but low comedy; the day before I leave, the local food
and water has caught up to me and I've got the beginnings of a fine
case of traveller's dysentery.</p>

<p>As they're taking me to the airport early next morning, I get a
good look at Caracas in the rising sun. Passing through the
squatter towns on the outskirts of the city, I see that the
shanties are different from those in my dim thirty-five-year-old
memories. The corrugated tin and cardboard has given way to
crumbling red brick. Perhaps (I think) some progress does get
made.</p>

<p>Even as I'm pondering this, the van driver is telling us that in
Venezuela a liter of petroleum is cheaper than a liter of mineral
water. The oil boom goes on, and so does the regressive politics it
feeds. There was a bloody coup attempt in 1994, and the prospect of
what may happen after the upcoming elections worries a lot of
people. Seen from outside, the odds are there will be some drama
but no real change.</p>

<p>But, you'll be wondering, what of Diana? What of her invitation
to go out, go native, cruise the barrios laughing and join the
stridulating crickets in their warm jungle night? That hint of
seduction, the exogamic sparkle in her eyes...did she? Did we?
Would I have? Was it all my imagination?</p>

<p>She never showed. And I never learned her last name. Venezuela's
charming everywoman, and her city, kept their secrets. And I flew
away home.</p>
