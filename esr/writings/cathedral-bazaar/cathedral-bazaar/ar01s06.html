was successful, I made a conscious decision to test this theory on my
new (admittedly much less complex and ambitious) project.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">But the first thing I did was reorganize and simplify popclient
a lot.  Carl Harris's implementation was very sound, but exhibited a
kind of unnecessary complexity common to many C programmers.  He
treated the code as central and the data structures as support for the
code.  As a result, the code was beautiful but the data structure
design ad-hoc and rather ugly (at least by the high standards of this
veteran LISP hacker).</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I had another purpose for rewriting besides improving the code and the
data structure design, however.  That was to evolve it into something
I understood completely.  It's no fun to be responsible for fixing
bugs in a program you don't understand.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the first month or so, then, I was simply following out the
implications of Carl's basic design.  The first serious change I made
was to add IMAP support.  I did this by reorganizing the protocol
machines into a generic driver and three method tables (for POP2,
POP3, and IMAP).  This and the previous changes illustrate a general
principle that's good for programmers to keep in mind, especially
in languages like C that don't naturally do dynamic typing:</p><blockquote xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="blockquote"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">9. Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot
       better than the other way around.</p></blockquote><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Brooks, Chapter 9: ``Show me your flowchart and conceal your
tables, and I shall continue to be mystified.  Show me your tables,
and I won't usually need your flowchart; it'll be obvious.''  Allowing
for thirty years of terminological/cultural shift, it's the same
point.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At this point (early September 1996, about six weeks from zero)
I started thinking that a name change might be in order&#8212;after all,
it wasn't just a POP client any more.  But I hesitated, because there
was as yet nothing genuinely new in the design.  My version of
popclient had yet to develop an identity of its own.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">That changed, radically, when popclient learned how to forward fetched
mail to the SMTP port.  I'll get to that in a moment.  But first: I
said earlier that I'd decided to use this project to test my theory
about what Linus Torvalds had done right.  How (you may well ask) did
I do that?  In these ways:</p><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I released early and often (almost never less often
      than every ten days; during periods of intense development, once
      a day).</p></li><li xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I grew my beta list by adding to it everyone who contacted me
      about fetchmail.</p></li><li xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I sent chatty announcements to the beta list whenever I
      released, encouraging people to participate.</p></li><li xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">And I listened to my beta-testers, polling them about design
      decisions and stroking them whenever they sent in patches
      and feedback.</p></li></ul></div><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The payoff from these simple measures was immediate.  From the
beginning of the project, I got bug reports of a quality most
developers would kill for, often with good fixes attached.  I
got thoughtful criticism, I got fan mail, I got intelligent
feature suggestions.  Which leads to:</p><blockquote xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="blockquote"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">10. If you treat your beta-testers as if they're
        your most valuable resource, they will respond by becoming
        your most valuable resource.</p></blockquote><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One interesting measure of fetchmail's success is the sheer size
of the project beta list, fetchmail-friends.  At the time of latest
revision of this paper (November 2000) it has 287 members and is
adding two or three a week.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Actually, when I revised in late May 1997 I found the list was
beginning to lose members from its high of close to 300 for an
interesting reason.  Several people have asked me to unsubscribe them
because fetchmail is working so well for them that they no longer need
to see the list traffic!  Perhaps this is part of the normal
life-cycle of a mature bazaar-style project.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s05.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s07.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">How Many Eyeballs Tame Complexity </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Popclient becomes Fetchmail</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
