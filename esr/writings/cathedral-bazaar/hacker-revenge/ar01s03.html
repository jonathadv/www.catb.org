effective software-development method ever <span class="emphasis"><em>and didn't know
it!</em></span>.  That is, an effective practice had evolved as a set of
customs, transmitted by imitation and example, without the theory or
language to explain why the practice worked.</p><p>In retrospect, lacking that theory and that language hampered us in
two ways.  First: we couldn't think systematically about how to
improve our own methods. Second: we couldn't explain or sell the
method to anyone else.</p><p>At the time, I was thinking about only the first effect.  My
sole intention in writing the original paper was to give the hacker
culture an appropriate language to use internally, to explain itself
to itself.  So I wrote down what I had seen, framed as a narrative and
with appropriately vivid metaphors to describe the logic that could be
deduced behind the customs. </p><p>There was no really fundamental discovery in <i>The
Cathedral and the Bazaar</i>.  I did not invent any of the
methods it describes. What was novel was not the facts it described
but those metaphors and the narrative&#8212;a simple, powerful story
that encouraged the reader to see the facts in a new way.  I was
attempting a bit of memetic engineering on the hacker culture's
generative myths.</p><p>I first gave the full paper at Linux Kongress, May 1997 in Bavaria.
The fact that it was received with rapt attention and thunderous
applause by an audience in which there were very few native speakers
of English seemed to confirm that I was onto something.  But, as it
turned out, the sheer chance that I was seated next to publisher Tim
O'Reilly at the Thursday night banquet set in motion a more important
train of consequences.</p><p>As a long-time admirer of O'Reilly's institutional style, I had
been looking forward to meeting Tim for some years.  We had a
wide-ranging conversation (much of it exploring our common interest in
classic science fiction) that led to an invitation for me to deliver
<i>The Cathedral and the Bazaar</i> at Tim's Perl
Conference later in the year.</p><p>Once again, the paper was well-received&#8212;with cheers and a
standing ovation, in fact.  I knew from my email that since Bavaria,
word about <i>The Cathedral and the Bazaar</i> had
spread over the Internet like a fire in dry grass.  Many in the
audience had already read it, and my speech was less a revelation of
novelty for them than an opportunity to celebrate the new language and
the consciousness that went with it. That standing ovation was not so
much for my work as for the hacker culture itself&#8212;and rightly
so.</p><p>Though I didn't know it, my experiment in memetic engineering was
about to light a bigger fire.  Some of the people for whom my speech
was genuinely novel were from Netscape Communications, Inc.  And
Netscape was in trouble.</p><p>Netscape, a pioneering Internet-technology company and Wall Street
highflier, had been targeted for destruction by Microsoft.  Microsoft
rightly feared that the open Web standards embodied by Netscape's
browser might lead to an erosion of the Redmond giant's lucrative
monopoly on the PC desktop.  All the weight of Microsoft's billions,
and shady tactics that would later trigger an antitrust lawsuit,
were deployed to crush the Netscape browser.</p><p>For Netscape, the issue was less browser-related income (never
more than a small fraction of their revenues) than maintaining a safe
space for their much more valuable server business.  If Microsoft's
Internet Explorer achieved market dominance, Microsoft would be able
to bend the Web's protocols away from open standards and into
proprietary channels that only <span class="emphasis"><em>Microsoft's</em></span>
servers would be able to service.</p><p>Within Netscape there was intense debate about how to counter the
threat.  One of the options proposed early on was to throw the
Netscape browser source open&#8212;but it was a hard case to argue
without strong reasons to believe that doing so would prevent
Internet Explorer dominance.</p><p>I didn't know it at the time, but <i>The Cathedral and
the Bazaar</i> became a major factor in making that case.
Through the winter of 1997, as I was working on the material for my
next paper, the stage was being set for Netscape to break the rules of
the proprietary game and offer my tribe an unprecedented
opportunity.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s02.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s04.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Beyond Brooks's Law </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> The Road to Mountain View</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
