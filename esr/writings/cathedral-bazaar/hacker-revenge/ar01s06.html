The hard part
(for me, anyway) was accepting what my own role had to be. </p><p>One thing I understood from the beginning is that the press almost
completely tunes out abstractions.  They won't write about ideas
without larger-than-life personalities fronting them.  Everything has
to be story, drama, conflict, sound bites.  Otherwise, most reporters
will simply go to sleep&#8212;and even if they don't, their editors
will.</p><p>Accordingly, I knew somebody with very particular characteristics
would be needed to front the community's response to the Netscape
opportunity.  We needed a firebrand, a spin doctor, a propagandist, an
ambassador, an evangelist&#8212;somebody who could dance and sing and
shout from the housetops and seduce reporters and huggermug with CEOs
and bang the media machine until its contrary gears ground out the
message: <span class="emphasis"><em>the revolution is here!</em></span>.</p><p>Unlike most hackers, I have the brain chemistry of an extrovert and
had already had extensive experience at dealing with the press.
Looking around me, I couldn't see anyone better qualified to play
evangelist.  But I didn't want the job, because I knew it would cost
me my life for many months, maybe for years.  My privacy would be
destroyed.  I'd probably end up both caricatured as a geek by the
mainstream press and (worse) despised as a sell-out or glory-hog by a
significant fraction of my own tribe.  Worse than all the other bad
consequences put together, I probably wouldn't have time to hack any
more!</p><p>I had to ask myself: are you fed up enough with watching your
tribe lose to do <span class="emphasis"><em>whatever it takes</em></span> to win?  I
decided the answer was yes&#8212;and having so decided, threw myself into
the dirty but necessary job of becoming a public figure and media
personality.</p><p>I'd learned some basic media chops while editing <i>The
New Hacker's Dictionary</i>.  This time I took it much more
seriously and developed an entire theory of media manipulation, which I
then proceeded to apply.  The theory centers around the use of what I
call ``attractive dissonance'' to fan an itchy curiosity about the
evangelist, and then exploiting that itch for all it's worth in
promoting the ideas.</p><p>This is not the place for a detailed exposition of my theory.
But intelligent readers can probably deduce much of it from the phrase
``optimal level of provocation'' and the fact that my interview
technique involves cheerfully discussing my interests in guns,
anarchism and witchcraft while looking as well-groomed, boyishly
charming, and all-American wholesome as I can possibly manage.  The
trick is to sound challengingly weird but convey a reassuring aura of
honesty and simplicity.  (Note that to make the trick work, I think
you have to genuinely <span class="emphasis"><em>be</em></span> like that; faking either
quality has a high risk of exposure and I don't recommend it.)</p><p>The combination of the ``open source'' label and deliberate promotion
of myself as an evangelist turned out to have both the good and bad
consequences that I expected.  The ten months after the Netscape
announcement featured a steady exponential increase in media coverage of
Linux and the open-source world in general.  Throughout this period, 
approximately a third of these articles quoted me directly; most of
the other two thirds used me as a background source.  At the same
time, a vociferous minority of hackers declared me an evil egotist.
I managed to preserve a sense of humor about both outcomes (though
occasionally with some difficulty).</p><p>My plan from the beginning was that, eventually, I would hand off the
evangelist role to some successor, either an individual or
organization.  There would come a time when charisma became less
effective than broad-based institutional respectability (and, from my
own point of view, the sooner the better!).  I am attempting to
transfer my personal connections and carefully built-up reputation
with the press to the Open Source Initiative, an incorporated
nonprofit formed specifically to manage the Open Source trademark.  At
time of writing I am still the president of this organization, but hope and
expect not to remain so indefinitely.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s05.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s07.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">The Origins of `Open Source' </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Phases of the Campaign</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
