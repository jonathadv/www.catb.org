consensus theory of what `free software' or `open source' is.  The
clearest expression of this common theory can be found in the various
open-source licenses, all of which have crucial common
elements. </p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1997 these common elements were distilled into the Debian Free
Software Guidelines, which became the <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://www.opensource.org" target="_top">Open Source Definition</a>.  Under
the guidelines defined by the OSD, an open-source license must protect an
unconditional right of any party to modify (and redistribute modified
versions of) open-source software.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thus, the implicit theory of the OSD (and OSD-conformant
licenses such as the GPL, the BSD license, and Perl's Artistic
License) is that anyone can hack anything.  Nothing prevents half a
dozen different people from taking any given open-source product (such
as, say the Free Software Foundations's gcc C compiler), duplicating
the sources, running off with them in different evolutionary
directions, but all claiming to be <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">the</i></span>
product.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This kind of divergence is called a <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fork</i></span>.
The most important characteristic of a fork is that it spawns
competing projects that cannot later exchange code, splitting the
potential developer community.  (There are phenomena that look
superficially like forking but are not, such as the proliferation of
different Linux distributions. In these pseudo-forking cases there may
be separate projects, but they use mostly common code and can benefit
from each other's development efforts completely enough that they are
neither technically nor sociologically a waste, and are not perceived
as forks.)</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The open-source licenses do nothing to restrain forking, let
alone pseudo-forking; in fact, one could argue that they implicitly
encourage both.  In practice, however, pseudo-forking is common but
forking almost never happens.  Splits in major projects have been
rare, and are always accompanied by re-labeling and a large volume of
public self-justification.  It is clear, in such cases as the GNU
Emacs/XEmacs split, or the gcc/egcs split, or the various fissionings
of the BSD splinter groups, that the splitters felt they were going
against a fairly powerful community norm <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="ar01s22.html#BSD">[BSD]</a>.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In fact (and in contradiction to the anyone-can-hack-anything
consensus theory) the open-source culture has an elaborate but
largely unadmitted set of ownership customs. These customs
regulate who can modify software, the circumstances under which
it can be modified, and (especially) who has the right to
redistribute modified versions back to the community.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The taboos of a culture throw its norms into sharp relief.  Therefore,
it will be useful later on if we summarize some important ones here:</p><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> 
There is strong social pressure against forking projects.  It does
not happen except under plea of dire necessity, with much public
self-justification, and requires a renaming.</p></li><li xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
Distributing changes to a project without the cooperation of the
moderators is frowned upon, except in special cases like essentially
trivial porting fixes.</p></li><li xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
Removing a person's name from a project history, credits, or maintainer
list is absolutely <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">not done</i></span> without the person's explicit
consent.</p></li></ul></div><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the remainder of this essay, we shall examine these taboos and
ownership customs in detail.  We shall inquire not only into how they
function but what they reveal about the underlying social dynamics and
incentive structures of the open-source community.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s02.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s04.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">The Varieties of Hacker Ideology </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Ownership and Open Source</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
