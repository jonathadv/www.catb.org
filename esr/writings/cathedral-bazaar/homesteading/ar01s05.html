analogy for these customs that is far outside the domain of hackers'
usual concerns.  As students of legal history and political philosophy
may recognize, the theory of property they imply is virtually
identical to the Anglo-American common-law theory of land tenure!</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this theory, there are three ways to acquire ownership of land:</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On a frontier, where land exists that has never had an owner, one
can acquire ownership by <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">homesteading</i></span>, mixing one's labor
with the unowned land, fencing it, and defending one's title.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The usual means of transfer in settled areas is <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">transfer of
title</i></span>&#8212;that is, receiving the deed from the previous owner.
In this theory, the concept of `chain of title' is important.
The ideal proof of ownership is a chain of deeds and transfers
extending back to when the land was originally homesteaded.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, the common-law theory recognizes that land title may be
lost or abandoned (for example, if the owner dies without heirs, or
the records needed to establish chain of title to vacant land are
gone).  A piece of land that has become derelict in this way may be
claimed by <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">adverse possession</i></span>&#8212;one moves in,
improves it, and defends title as if homesteading.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This theory, like hacker customs, evolved organically in a context
where central authority was weak or nonexistent.  It developed over a
period of a thousand years from Norse and Germanic tribal law.
Because it was systematized and rationalized in the early modern era
by the English political philosopher John Locke, it is sometimes
referred to as the Lockean theory of property.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Logically similar theories have tended to evolve wherever
property has high economic or survival value and no single authority
is powerful enough to force central allocation of scarce goods.  This
is true even in the hunter-gatherer cultures that are sometimes
romantically thought to have no concept of `property'.  For example,
in the traditions of the !Kung San bushmen of the Kgalagadi (formerly
`Kalahari') Desert, there is no ownership of hunting grounds.  But
there <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">is</i></span> ownership of waterholes and springs
under a theory recognizably akin to Locke's.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The !Kung San example is instructive, because it shows that Lockean
property customs arise only where the expected return from the
resource exceeds the expected cost of defending it.  Hunting grounds
are not property because the return from hunting is highly
unpredictable and variable, and (although highly prized) not a
necessity for day-to-day survival.  Waterholes, on the other hand, are
vital to survival and small enough to defend.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The `noosphere' of this essay's title is the territory of ideas, the
space of all possible thoughts <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="ar01s22.html#N">[N]</a>.  What we see
implied in hacker ownership customs is a Lockean theory of property
rights in one subset of the noosphere, the space of all programs.
Hence `homesteading the noosphere', which is what every founder of a
new open-source project does.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Faré Rideau <tt xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&lt;<a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="mailto:fare@tunes.org">fare@tunes.org</a>&gt;</tt> correctly
points out that hackers do not exactly operate in the territory of
pure ideas. He asserts that what hackers own is <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">programming
projects</i></span>&#8212;intensional focus points of material labor
(development, service, etc), to which are associated things like
reputation, trustworthiness, etc.  He therefore asserts that the space
spanned by hacker projects, is <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">not</i></span> the noosphere
but a sort of dual of it, the space of noosphere-exploring program
projects.  (With an apologetic nod to the astrophysicists out there,
it would be etymologically correct to call this dual space the
`ergosphere' or `sphere of work'.)</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In practice, the distinction between noosphere and ergosphere is
not important for the purposes of our present argument.  It is dubious whether
the `noosphere' in the pure sense on which Faré insists can be said
to exist in any meaningful way; one would almost have to be a
Platonic philosopher to believe in it.  And the distinction between
noosphere and ergosphere is only of <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">practical</i></span>
importance if one wishes to assert that ideas (the elements of the
noosphere) cannot be owned, but their instantiations as projects can.
This question leads to issues in the theory of intellectual property
which are beyond the scope of this essay (but see <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="ar01s22.html#DF">
[DF]</a>).</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To avoid confusion, however, it is important to note that
neither the noosphere nor the ergosphere is the same as the totality
of virtual locations in electronic media that is sometimes (to the
disgust of most hackers) called `cyberspace'.  Property there is
regulated by completely different rules that are closer to those of
the material substratum&#8212;essentially, he who owns the media and
machines on which a part of `cyberspace' is hosted owns that piece of
cyberspace as a result.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Lockean logic of custom suggests strongly that open-source
hackers observe the customs they do in order to defend some kind of
expected return from their effort.  The return must be more
significant than the effort of homesteading projects, the cost of
maintaining version histories that document `chain of title', and the
time cost of making public notifications and waiting before taking
adverse possession of an orphaned project.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, the `yield' from open source must be something more than
simply the use of the software, something else that would be
compromised or diluted by forking.  If use were the only issue, there
would be no taboo against forking, and open-source ownership would not
resemble land tenure at all.  In fact, this alternate world (where use
is the only yield, and forking is unproblematic) is the one implied by
existing open-source licenses.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We can eliminate some candidate kinds of yield right away.  Because
you can't coerce effectively over a network connection, seeking power
is right out.  Likewise, the open-source culture doesn't have anything
much resembling money or an internal scarcity economy, so hackers
cannot be pursuing anything very closely analogous to material wealth
(e.g. the accumulation of scarcity tokens).</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is one way that open-source activity can help people become
wealthier, however&#8212;a way that provides a valuable clue to what
actually motivates it.  Occasionally, the reputation one gains in the
hacker culture can spill over into the real world in economically
significant ways.  It can get you a better job offer, or a consulting
contract, or a book deal.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This kind of side effect, however, is at best rare and marginal for
most hackers; far too much so to make it convincing as a sole
explanation, even if we ignore the repeated protestations by hackers that
they're doing what they do not for money but out of idealism or love.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, the way such economic side effects are mediated is worth
examination.  Next we'll see that an understanding of the dynamics of
reputation within the open-source culture <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">itself</i></span> has
considerable explanatory power.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s04.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s06.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Ownership and Open Source </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> The Hacker Milieu as Gift Culture</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
