devalue or ignore the pure artistic satisfaction of designing
beautiful software and making it work.  Hackers all experience this kind
of satisfaction and thrive on it.  People for whom it is not a
significant motivation never become hackers in the first place, just
as people who don't love music never become composers.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">So perhaps we should consider another model of hacker behavior in
which the pure joy of craftsmanship is the primary motivation.
This `craftsmanship' model would have to explain hacker custom as a way
of maximizing both the opportunities for craftsmanship and the quality
of the results.  Does this conflict with or suggest different results
than the reputation game model?</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Not really.  In examining the craftsmanship model, we come back
to the same problems that constrain hackerdom to operate like a gift
culture.  How can one maximize quality if there is no metric for
quality?  If scarcity economics doesn't operate, what metrics are
available besides peer evaluation?  It appears that any craftsmanship
culture ultimately must structure itself through a reputation
game&#8212;and, in fact, we can observe exactly this dynamic in many
historical craftsmanship cultures from the medieval guilds
onwards.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In one important respect, the craftsmanship model is weaker than the
`gift culture' model; by itself, it doesn't help explain the
contradiction we began this essay with.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, the craftsmanship motivation itself may not be
psychologically as far removed from the reputation game as we might
like to assume.  Imagine your beautiful program locked up in a drawer
and never used again.  Now imagine it being used effectively and with
pleasure by many people.  Which dream gives you satisfaction?</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nevertheless, we'll keep an eye on the craftsmanship model.  It is
intuitively appealing to many hackers, and explains some aspects of
individual behavior well enough <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="ar01s22.html#HT">[HT]</a>.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After I published the first version of this essay on the Internet, an
anonymous respondent commented: ``You may not work to get reputation,
but the reputation is a real payment with consequences if you do the
job well.''  This is a subtle and important point.  The reputation
incentives continue to operate whether or not a craftsman is aware of
them; thus, ultimately, whether or not a hacker understands his own
behavior as part of the reputation game, his behavior will be shaped
by that game.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other respondents related peer-esteem rewards and the joy of
hacking to the levels above subsistence needs in Abraham Maslow's
well-known `hierarchy of values' model of human motivation <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="ar01s22.html#MH">[MH]</a>.  On this view, the joy of hacking fulfills a
self-actualization or transcendence need, which will not be
consistently expressed until lower-level needs (including those for
physical security and for `belongingness' or peer esteem) have been at
least minimally satisfied.  Thus, the reputation game may be critical
in providing a social context within which the joy of hacking can in
fact <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">become</i></span> the individual's primary
motive.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s06.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s08.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">The Hacker Milieu as Gift Culture </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> The Many Faces of Reputation</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
