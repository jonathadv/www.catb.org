coherent account of hacker ownership customs.  We understand the
yield from homesteading the noosphere now; it is peer repute in the
gift culture of hackers, with all the secondary gains and side effects
that implies.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From this understanding, we can analyze the Lockean property
customs of hackerdom as a means of <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">maximizing reputation
incentives</i></span>; of ensuring that peer credit goes where it is
due and does not go where it is not due.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The three taboos we observed above make perfect sense under this
analysis.  One's reputation can suffer unfairly if someone else
misappropriates or mangles one's work; these taboos (and related
customs) attempt to prevent this from happening.  (Or, to put it more
pragmatically, hackers generally refrain from forking or
rogue-patching others' projects in order to be able to deny legitimacy
to the same behavior practiced against themselves.)</p><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
Forking projects is bad because it exposes pre-fork contributors to
a reputation risk they can only control by being active in both
child projects simultaneously after the fork.  (This would generally
be too confusing or difficult to be practical.)</p></li><li xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
Distributing rogue patches (or, much worse, rogue binaries) exposes
the owners to an unfair reputation risk.  Even if the official code
is perfect, the owners will catch flak from bugs in the patches (but
see <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="ar01s22.html#rp">[RP]</a>).</p></li><li xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
Surreptitiously filing someone's name off a project is, in cultural
context, one of the ultimate crimes.  Doing this steals the victim's gift
to be presented as the thief's own.</p></li></ul></div><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of course, forking a project or distributing rogue patches for it also
directly attacks the reputation of the original developer's group.  If
I fork or rogue-patch your project, I am saying: &quot;you made a wrong
decision by failing to take the project where I am taking it&quot;; and
anyone who uses my forked variation is endorsing this challenge.  But this
in itself would be a fair challenge, albeit extreme; it's the sharpest end of
peer review.  It's therefore not sufficient in itself to account for
the taboos, though it doubtless contributes force to them.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All three taboo behaviors inflict global harm on the open-source
community as well as local harm on the victim(s).  Implicitly they
damage the entire community by decreasing each potential contributor's
perceived likelihood that gift/productive behavior will be
rewarded.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It's important to note that there are alternate candidate explanations
for two of these three taboos.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">First, hackers often explain their antipathy to forking projects
by bemoaning the wasteful duplication of work it would imply as the
child products evolve on more-or-less parallel courses into the
future. They may also observe that forking tends to split the
co-developer community, leaving both child projects with fewer brains
to use than the parent.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A respondent has pointed out that it is unusual for more than one 
offspring of a fork to survive with significant `market share' into
the long term.  This strengthens the incentives for all parties to
cooperate and avoid forking, because it's hard to know in advance
who will be on the losing side and see a lot of their work either
disappear entirely or languish in obscurity. </p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It has also been pointed out that the simple fact that forks are
likely to produce contention and dispute is enough to motivate social
pressure against them.  Contention and dispute disrupt the teamwork
that is necessary for each individual contributor to reach his or her
goals.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dislike of rogue patches is often explained by the objection
that they can create compatibility problems between the daughter 
versions, complicate bug-tracking enormously, and inflict work on
maintainers who have quite enough to do catching their
<span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">own</i></span> mistakes.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is considerable truth to these explanations, and they certainly
do their bit to reinforce the Lockean logic of ownership.  But while
intellectually attractive, they fail to explain why so much emotion
and territoriality gets displayed on the infrequent occasions that the
taboos get bent or broken&#8212;not just by the injured parties, but by
bystanders and observers who often react quite harshly.  Cold-blooded
concerns about duplication of work and maintainance hassles simply do
not sufficiently explain the observed behavior.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Then, too, there is the third taboo.  It's hard to see how anything
but the reputation-game analysis can explain this.  The fact that this
taboo is seldom analyzed much more deeply than ``It wouldn't be fair''
is revealing in its own way, as we shall see in the next section.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s08.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s10.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">The Many Faces of Reputation </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> The Problem of Ego</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
