contributions and returns peer esteem for them.  It's not hard to
observe the following rules:</p><blockquote xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="blockquote"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">1. If it doesn't work as well as I have been led
to expect it will, it's no good&#8212;no matter how clever and original
it is.</p></blockquote><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Note the phrase `led to expect'.  This rule is not a demand for
perfection; beta and experimental software is allowed to have bugs.
It's a demand that the user be able to accurately estimate risks from
the stage of the project and the developers' representations about
it.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This rule underlies the fact that open-source software tends to stay
in beta for a long time, and not get even a 1.0 version number until
the developers are very sure it will not hand out a lot of nasty
surprises.  In the closed-source world, Version 1.0 means ``Don't
touch this if you're prudent.''; in the open-source world it reads
something more like ``The developers are willing to bet their
reputations on this.''</p><blockquote xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="blockquote"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2. Work that extends the noosphere is better than
work that duplicates an existing piece of functional
territory.</p></blockquote><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The naive way to put this would have been: <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Original
work is better than mere duplication of the functions of existing
software.</i></span> But it's not actually quite that simple.
Duplicating the functions of existing <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">closed</i></span>
software counts as highly as original work if by doing so you break
open a closed protocol or format and make that territory newly
available.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thus, for example, one of the highest-prestige projects in the present
open-source world is Samba&#8212;the code that allows Unix machines to
act as clients or servers for Microsoft's proprietary SMB file-sharing
protocol.  There is very little creative work to be done here; it's
mostly an issue of getting the reverse-engineered details right.
Nevertheless, the members of the Samba group are perceived as heroes
because they neutralize a Microsoft effort to lock in whole user
populations and cordon off a big section of the noosphere.</p><blockquote xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="blockquote"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">3. Work that makes it into a major distribution
is better than work that doesn't.  Work carried in all major
distributions is most prestigious.</p></blockquote><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The major distributions include not just the big Linux distributions
like Red Hat, Debian, Caldera, and SuSE., but other collections
that are understood to have reputations of their own to maintain and
thus implicitly certify quality &#8212;like BSD distributions or the Free
Software Foundation source collection.</p><blockquote xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="blockquote"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">4. Utilization is the sincerest form of
flattery&#8212;and category killers are better than
also-rans.</p></blockquote><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Trusting the judgment of others is basic to the peer-review
process.  It's necessary because nobody has time to review all
possible alternatives.  So work used by lots of people is considered
better than work used by a few,</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To have done work so good that nobody cares to use the alternatives
any more is therefore to have earned huge prestige.  The most possible
peer esteem comes from having done widely popular, category-killing
original work that is carried by all major distributions.  People who
have pulled this off more than once are half-seriously referred to as
`demigods'.</p><blockquote xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="blockquote"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">5. Continued devotion to hard, boring work (like
debugging, or writing documentation) is more praiseworthy than
cherrypicking the fun and easy hacks.</p></blockquote><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This norm is how the community rewards necessary tasks that hackers
would not naturally incline towards.  It is to some extent
contradicted by:</p><blockquote xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="blockquote"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">6. Nontrivial extensions of function are better
than low-level patches and debugging.</p></blockquote><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The way this seems to work is that on a one-shot basis, adding a
feature is likely to get more reward than fixing a bug&#8212;unless
the bug is exceptionally nasty or obscure, such that nailing it is
itself a demonstration of unusual skill and cleverness.  But when these 
behaviors are extended over time, a person with a long history of
paying attention to and nailing even ordinary bugs may well out-rank
someone who has spent a similar amount of effort adding easy features.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A respondent has pointed out that these rules interact in
interesting ways and do not necessarily reward highest possible
utility all the time.  Ask a hacker whether he's likely to become
better known for a brand new tool of his own or for extensions to
someone else's and the answer ``new tool'' will not be in doubt.  But
ask about (a) a brand new tool which is only used a few times a day
invisibly by the OS but which rapidly becomes a category killer,
versus (b) several extensions to an existing tool which are neither
especially novel nor category-killers, but are daily used and daily
visible to a huge number of users</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">and you are likely to get some hesitation before the hacker settles on
(a).  These alternatives are about evenly stacked.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Said respondent gave this question point for me by adding ``Case
(a) is fetchmail; case (b) is your many Emacs extensions, like
<tt xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">vc.el</tt> and <tt xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">gud.el</tt>.''  And
indeed he is correct; I am more likely to be tagged ``the author of
fetchmail'' than ``author of a boatload of Emacs modes'', even though the
latter probably have had higher total utility over time.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">What may be going on here is simply that work with a novel `brand
identity' gets more notice than work aggregated to an existing
`brand'.  Elucidation of these rules, and what they tell us about the
hacker culture's scoreboarding system, would make a good topic for
further investigation.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s12.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s14.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Global Implications of the Reputation-Game Model </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Noospheric Property and the Ethology of Territory</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
