expressed by a distribution of design authority and partial property
rights.  While this is an efficient way to distribute incentives, it
also dilutes the authority of the project leader&#8212;most importantly,
it dilutes the leader's authority to squash potential conflicts.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While technical arguments over design might seem the most obvious risk
for internecine conflict, they are seldom a serious cause of strife.
These are usually relatively easily resolved by the territorial rule
that authority follows responsibility.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another way of resolving conflicts is by seniority&#8212;if two
contributors or groups of contributors have a dispute, and the dispute
cannot be resolved objectively, and neither owns the territory of the
dispute, the side that has put the most work into the project as a
whole (that is, the side with the most property rights in the whole
project) wins.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(Equivalently, the side with the least invested loses.  Interestingly
this happens to be the same heuristic that many relational database
engines use to resolve deadlocks.  When two threads are deadlocked over
resources, the side with the least invested in the current transaction
is selected as the deadlock victim and is terminated.  This usually
selects the longest running transaction, or the more senior, as the
victor.)</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These rules generally suffice to resolve most project disputes.  When
they do not, fiat of the project leader usually suffices.  Disputes
that survive both these filters are rare.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Conflicts do not, as a rule, become serious unless these two criteria
(&quot;authority follows responsibility&quot; and &quot;seniority wins&quot;) point in
different directions, <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">and</i></span> the authority of the project
leader is weak or absent.  The most obvious case in which this may
occur is a succession dispute following the disappearance of the
project lead.  I have been in one fight of this kind.  It was ugly,
painful, protracted, only resolved when all parties became exhausted
enough to hand control to an outside person, and I devoutly hope I am
never anywhere near anything of the kind again.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ultimately, all of these conflict-resolution mechanisms rest on the
entire hacker community's willingness to enforce them.  The only available
enforcement mechanisms are flaming and shunning&#8212;public condemnation
of those who break custom, and refusal to cooperate with them after
they have done so.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s16.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s18.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Project Structures and Ownership </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Acculturation Mechanisms and the Link to Academia</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
