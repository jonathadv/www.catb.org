an obscure term of art in philosophy.  It is pronounced KNOW-uh-sfeer
(two o-sounds, one long and stressed, one short and unstressed tending
towards schwa). If one is being excruciatingly correct about one's
orthography, the term is properly spelled with a diaeresis over the
second `o' to mark it as a separate vowel.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In more detail; this term for ``the sphere of human thought''
derives from the Greek `noos' meaning `mind', `intelligence', or `perception'.
It was invented by E. LeRoy in <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Les origines humaines et
l'evolution de l'intelligence</i></span> (Paris 1928).  It was
popularized first by the Russian biologist and pioneering ecologist
Vladimir Ivanovich Vernadsky, (1863&#8211;1945), then by the Jesuit
paleontologist/philosopher Pierre Teilhard de Chardin
(1881&#8211;1955).  It is with Teilhard de Chardin's theory of future human
evolution to a form of pure mind culminating in union with the Godhead
that the term is now primarily associated.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="DF"/><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">[DF]</i></span>
David Friedman, one of the most lucid and accessible thinkers in

One interesting difference between the Linux and BSD worlds is that
the Linux kernel (and associated OS core utilities) have never forked,
but BSD's has, at least three times.  What makes this interesting is
that the social structure of the BSD groups is centralized in a way
intended to define clear lines of authority and to prevent forking, while
the decentralized and amorphous Linux community takes no such
measures.  It appears that the projects which open up development
the most actually have the <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">least</i></span> tendency to fork!</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Henry Spencer <tt xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&lt;<a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="mailto:henry@spsystems.net">henry@spsystems.net</a>&gt;</tt> suggests that, in general, the
stability of a political system is inversely proportional to the
height of the entry barriers to its political process.  His analysis
is worth quoting here:</p><blockquote xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="blockquote"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One major strength of a relatively open democracy is that most potential 
revolutionaries find it easier to make progress toward their objectives by
working via the system rather by attacking it.  This strength is easily
undermined if established parties act together to `raise the bar', making
it more difficult for small dissatisfied groups to see <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">some</i></span> progress
made toward their goals.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(A similar principle can be found in economics.  Open markets have the
strongest competition, and generally the best and cheapest products.
Because of this, it's very much in the best interests of established
companies to make market entry more difficult&#8212;for example, by
convincing governments to require elaborate RFI testing on computers, or  
by creating `consensus' standards which are so complex that they cannot be
implemented effectively from scratch without large resources.  The markets
with the strongest entry barriers are the ones that come under the
strongest attack from revolutionaries, e.g. the Internet and the Justice
Dept. vs. the Bell System.)</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An open process with low entry barriers encourages participation rather
than secession, because one can get results without the high overheads of
secession.  The results may not be as impressive as what could be achieved
by seceding, but they come at a lower price, and most people will consider
that an acceptable tradeoff.  (When the Spanish government revoked
Franco's anti-Basque laws and offered the Basque provinces their own
schools and limited local autonomy, most of the Basque Separatist movement
evaporated almost overnight.  Only the hard-core Marxists insisted that it
wasn't good enough.)</p></blockquote><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="rp"/><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">[RP]</i></span>
There are some subtleties about rogue patches.  One can divide them
into `friendly' and `unfriendly' types.  A `friendly' patch is
designed to be merged back into the project's main-line sources under
the maintainer's control (whether or not that merge actually happens); an
`unfriendly' one is intended to yank the project in a direction the
maintainer doesn't approve.  Some projects (notably the Linux kernel
itself) are pretty relaxed about friendly patches and even encourage
independent distribution of them as part of their beta-test phase.
An unfriendly patch, on the other hand, represents a decision to
compete with the original and is a serious matter.  Maintaining a whole
raft of unfriendly patches tends to lead to forking.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="lw"/><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">[LW]</i></span>

In evolutionary terms, the craftsman's urge itself may (like
internalized ethics) be a result of the high risk and cost of
deception.  Evolutionary psychologists have collected experimental
evidence <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="ar01s23.html#BCT">[BCT]</a> that human beings have brain logic
specialized for detecting social deceptions, and it is fairly easy to
see why our ancestors should have been selected for ability to detect
cheating.  Therefore, if one wishes to have a reputation for
personality traits that confer advantage but are risky or costly, it
may actually be better tactics to actually have these traits than to
fake them.  (``Honesty is the best policy'')</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Evolutionary psychologists have suggested that this explains behavior
like barroom fights.  Among younger adult male humans, having a
reputation for toughness is both socially and (even in today's
feminist-influenced climate) sexually useful.  Faking toughness,
however, is extremely risky; the negative result of being found out
leaves one in a worse position than never having claimed the trait.
The cost of deception is so high that it is sometimes better
minimaxing to internalize toughness and risk serious injury in a
fight to prove it.  Parallel observations have been made about less
controversial traits like honesty.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Though the primary meditation-like rewards of creative work should not
be underestimated, the craftsman's urge is probably at least in part
just such an internalization (where the base trait is `capacity for
painstaking work' or something similar).</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Handicap theory may also be relevant.  The peacock's gaudy tail
and the stag's massive rack of antlers are sexy to females because
they send a message about the health of the male (and, consequently,
its fitness to sire healthy offspring).  They say: &quot;I am so vigorous
that I can afford to waste a lot of energy on this extravagant
display.&quot; Giving away source code, like owning a sports car, is very
similar to such showy, wasteful finery - it's expense without obvious
return, and makes the giver at least theoretically very sexy.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="MH"/><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">[MH]</i></span> A concise summary of

humility from leaders may be a more general characteristic of gift or
abundance cultures.  David Christie <tt xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&lt;<a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="mailto:dc@netscape.com">dc@netscape.com</a>&gt;</tt> reports on
a trip through the outer islands of Fiji:</p><blockquote xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="blockquote"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Fijian village chiefs, we observed the same sort of
self-deprecating, low-key leadership style that you attribute to open
source project leaders. [...] Though accorded great respect and of
course all of whatever actual power there is in Fiji, the chiefs we
met demonstrated genuine humility and often a saint-like acceptance of
their duty.  This is particularly interesting given that being chief
is a hereditary role, not an elected position or a popularity contest.
Somehow they are trained to it by the culture itself, although they
are born to it, not chosen by their peers.''  He goes on to emphasize
that he believes the characteristic style of Fijian chiefs springs
from the difficulty of compelling cooperation: a chief has ``no big
carrot or big stick''.</p></blockquote><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="no"/><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">[NO]</i></span>
As a matter of observable fact, people who found successful projects
gather more prestige than people who do arguably equal amounts of work
debugging and assisting with successful projects.  An earlier version
of this paper asked ``Is this a rational valuation of comparative
effort, or is it a second-order effect of the unconscious territorial
model we have adduced here?''  Several respondents suggested persuasive
and essentially equivalent theories.  The following analysis by 
Ryan Waldron <tt xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&lt;<a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="mailto:rew@erebor.com">rew@erebor.com</a>&gt;</tt> puts the case well:</p><blockquote xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="blockquote"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the context of the Lockean land theory, one who establishes a new and
successful project has essentially discovered or opened up new territory on
which others can homestead.  For most successful projects, there is a
pattern of declining returns, so that after a while, the credit for
contributions to a project has become so diffuse that it is hard for
significant reputation to accrete to a late participant, regardless of the
quality of his work.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For instance, how good a job would I have to do making
modifications to the perl code to have even a fraction of the
recognition for my participation that Larry, Tom, Randall, and others
have achieved?</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, if a new project is founded [by someone else] tomorrow, and I
am an early and frequent participant in it, my ability to share in the
respect generated by such a successful project is greatly enhanced by
my early participation therein (assuming similar quality of
contributions).  I reckon it to be similar to those who invest in
Microoft stock early and those who invest in it later.  Everyone may
profit, but early participants profit more.  Therefore, at some point
I will be more interested in a new and successful IPO than I will be
in participating in the continual increase of an existing body of
corporate stock.</p></blockquote><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ryan Waldron's analogy can be extended.  The project founder has
to do a missionary sell of a new idea that may or may not be acceptable
or of use to others.  Thus the founder incurs something analogous to
an IPO risk (of possible damage to their reputation), more so than
others who assist with a project that has already garnered some
acceptance by their peers. The founder's reward is consistent despite
the fact that the assistants may be putting in more work in real
terms.  This is easily seen as analogous to the relationship between
risk and rewards in an exchange economy.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other respondents have observed that our nervous system is tuned
to perceive differences, not steady state. The revolutionary change
evidenced by the creation of a new project is therefore much more
noticeable than the cumulative effect of constant incremental
improvement. Thus Linus is revered as the father of Linux, although
the net effect of improvements by thousands of other contributors have
done more to contribute to the success of the OS than one man's work
ever could.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="HD"/><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">[HD]</i></span> The phrase
``de-commoditizing'' is a reference to the <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://www.opensource.org/halloween/" target="_top">Halloween Documents</a>
in which Microsoft used ``de-commoditize'' quite frankly to refer to
their most effective long-term strategy for maintaining an
exploitative monopoly lock on customers.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="KN"/><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">[HD]</i></span> A respondent points
out that the valus surrounding the ``You're not a hacker until other
hackers call you a hacker'' norm parallel ideals professed (if not
always achieved) by other meritocratic brotherhoods within social
elites sufficiently wealthy to escape the surrounding scarcity
economy.  In the medieval European ideal of knighthood, for example,
the aspiring knight was expected to fight for the right; to seek honor
rather than gain; to take the side of the weak and oppressed; and to
constantly seek challenges that tested his prowess to the utmost.  In
return, the knight-aspirant could regard himself (and be regarded by
others) as among the best of the best&#8212;but only after his skill and
virtue had been admitted and ratified by other knights.  In the
knightly ideal extolled by the Arthurian tales and Chansons de Geste
we see a mix of idealism, continual self-challenge, and status-seeking
similar to that which animates hackers today. It seems likely that
similar values and behavioral norms should evolve around any skill
that both requires great dedication and confers a kind of
power.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="GNU"/><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">[GNU]</i></span>
