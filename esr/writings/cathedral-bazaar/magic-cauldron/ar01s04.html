delusion, which often confuses peoples' thinking about the economics of
open-source software.  It is that ``information wants to be free''.
This usually unpacks to a claim that the zero marginal cost of
reproducing digital information implies that its clearing price ought
to be zero (or that a market full of duplicators will force it to 
zero).</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some kinds of information really do want to be free, in the weak
sense that their value goes up as more people have access to them&#8212;a
technical standards document is a good example.  But the myth that
<span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">all</i></span> information wants to be free is readily
exploded by considering the value of information that constitutes a
privileged pointer to a rivalrous good&#8212;a treasure map, say, or a
Swiss bank account number, or a claim on services such as a computer
account password.  Even though the claiming information can be
duplicated at zero cost, the item being claimed cannot be.  Hence, the
non-zero marginal cost for the item can be inherited by the claiming
information.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We mention this myth mainly to assert that it is almost
unrelated to the economic-utility arguments for open source; as we'll
see later, those would generally hold up well even under the
assumption that software actually <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">does</i></span> have the
(nonzero) value structure of a manufactured good.  We therefore have
no need to tackle the question of whether software `should' be free or
not.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s03.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s05.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">The Manufacturing Delusion </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> The Inverse Commons</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
