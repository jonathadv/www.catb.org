can build another&#8212;a hard-nosed economic explanation of what makes
open-source cooperation sustainable.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This is a question that bears examination on a couple of different
levels.  On one level, we need to explain the behavior of individuals who
contribute to open-source projects; on another, we need to understand
the economic forces that sustain cooperation on open-source projects like
Linux or Apache.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Again, we must first demolish a widespread folk model that interferes
with understanding.  Over every attempt to explain cooperative 
behavior there looms the shadow of Garret Hardin's ``Tragedy of the
Commons''.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hardin famously asks us to imagine a green held in common by a village
of peasants, who graze their cattle there.  But grazing degrades the
commons, tearing up grass and leaving muddy patches, which re-grow
their cover only slowly.  If there is no agreed-upon (and enforced!)
policy to allocate grazing rights that prevents overgrazing, all
parties' incentives push them to run as many cattle as quickly as
possible, trying to extract maximum value before the commons degrades
into a sea of mud.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most people have an intuitive model of cooperative behavior that
goes much like this.  The tragedy of the commons actually stems from
two linked problems, one of overuse and another of underprovision.  On
the demand side, the commons situation encourages a race to the bottom
by overuse&#8212;what economists call a congested&#8211;public-good
problem.  On the supply side, the commons rewards free-rider
behavior&#8212;removing or diminishing incentives for individual
actors to invest in developing more pasturage.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The tragedy of the commons predicts only three possible outcomes.  One
is the sea of mud.  Another is for some actor with coercive power to
enforce an allocation policy on behalf of the village (the communist
solution).  The third is for the commons to break up as village
members fence off bits they can defend and manage sustainably (the
property-rights solution).</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When people reflexively apply this model to open-source cooperation,
they expect it to be unstable with a short half-life.  Since there's
no obvious way to enforce an allocation policy for programmer time
over the Internet, this model leads straight to a prediction that the
commons will break up, with various bits of software being taken
closed-source and a rapidly decreasing amount of work being fed back
into the communal pool.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In fact, it is empirically clear that the trend is opposite to
this.  The trend in breadth and volume of open-source development can
be measured by submissions per day at Metalab and SourceForge (the
leading Linux source sites) or announcements per day at freshmeat.net
(a site dedicated to advertising new software releases).  Volume on
both is steadily and rapidly increasing.  Clearly there is some
critical way in which the ``Tragedy of the Commons'' model fails to
capture what is actually going on.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Part of the answer certainly lies in the fact that using
software does not decrease its value.  Indeed, widespread use of
open-source software tends to <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">increase</i></span> its value,
as users fold in their own fixes and features (code patches).  In this
inverse commons, the grass grows taller when it's grazed upon.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">That this public good cannot be degraded by overuse takes care
of half of Hardin's tragedy, the congested&#8211;public-goods problem.
It doesn't explain why open source doesn't suffer from underprovision.
Why don't people who know the open-source community exists universally
exhibit free-rider behavior behavior, waiting for others to do the
work they need, or (if they do the work themselves) not bothering to
contribute the work back into the commons?</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Part of the answer lies in the fact that people don't merely
need solutions, they need solutions <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">on time</i></span>. It's
seldom possible to predict when someone else will finish a given piece
of needed work.  If the payoff from fixing a bug or adding a feature
is sufficient to any potential contributor, that person will dive in
and do it (at which point the fact that everyone else is a free rider
becomes irrelevant).</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another part of the answer lies in the fact that the putative market
value of small patches to a common source base is hard to capture.
Supposing I write a fix for an irritating bug, and suppose many people
realize the fix has money value; how do I collect from all those
people?  Conventional payment systems have high enough overheads to
make this a real problem for the sorts of micropayments that would
usually be appropriate.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It may be more to the point that this value is not merely hard to
capture, in the general case it's hard to even <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">assign</i></span>.  
As a thought experiment, let us suppose that the Internet came 
equipped with the theoretically ideal micropayment system&#8212;secure,
universally accessible, zero-overhead.  Now let's say you have written a
patch labeled ``Miscellaneous Fixes to the Linux Kernel''.  How do you
know what price to ask?  How would a potential buyer, not having seen
the patch yet, know what is reasonable to pay for it?</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">What we have here is almost like a funhouse-mirror image of
F. A. Hayek's `calculation problem'&#8212;it would take a superbeing,
both able to evaluate the functional worth of patches and trusted to
set prices accordingly, to lubricate trade.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Unfortunately, there's a serious superbeing shortage, so patch author
J. Random Hacker is left with two choices: sit on the patch, or throw
it into the pool for free.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sitting on the patch gains nothing. Indeed, it incurs a future
cost&#8212;the effort involved in re-merging the patch into the source
base in each new release.  So the payoff from this choice is actually
negative (and multiplied by the rapid release tempo characteristic of
open-source projects).</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To put it more positively, the contributor gains by passing
maintainance overhead of the patch to the source-code owners and the 
rest of the project group.  He also gains because others will improve
on his work in the future.  Finally, because he won't have to maintain
the patch himself, he will be able to afford more time on other and
larger customizations to suit his needs.  The same arguments that
favor opening source for entire packages apply to patches as well.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Throwing the patch in the pool may gain nothing, or it may encourage
reciprocal effort from others that will address some of J. Random's
problems in the future.  This choice, apparently altruistic, is
actually optimally selfish in a game-theoretic sense.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In analyzing this kind of cooperation, it is important to note that
while there is a free-rider problem (work may be underprovided in the
absence of money or money-equivalent compensation) it is not one that
scales with the number of end users (see the endnote on <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="ar01s19.html#scaling">[ST]</a> for discussion).  The complexity and
communications overhead of an open-source project is almost entirely a
function of the number of developers involved; having more end users
who never look at source costs effectively nothing.  It may increase
the rate of silly questions appearing on the project mailing lists,
but this is relatively easily forestalled by maintaining a Frequently
Asked Questions list and blithely ignoring questioners who have
obviously not read it (and in fact both these practices are typical).</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The real free-rider problems in open-source software are more a
function of friction costs in submitting patches than anything else.
A potential contributor with little stake in the cultural reputation
game (see <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Homesteading the Noosphere</i> <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="ar01s20.html#HtN">[HtN]</a>) may, in the absence of money compensation,
think ``It's not worth submitting this fix because I'll have to clean
up the patch, write a ChangeLog entry, and sign the FSF assignment
papers...''.  It's for this reason that the number of contributors
(and, at second order, the success of projects) is strongly and
inversely correlated with the number of hoops each project makes a
contributing user go through.  Such friction costs may be political as
well as mechanical. Together I think they explain why the loose,
amorphous Linux culture has attracted orders of magnitude more
cooperative energy than the more tightly organized and centralized BSD
efforts&#8212;and why the Free Software Foundation has receded in
relative importance as Linux has risen.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This is all good as far as it goes.  But it is an after-the-fact
explanation of what J. Random Hacker does with his patch after he has
created it. The other half we need is an economic explanation of how
JRH was able to write that patch in the first place, rather than
having to work on a closed-source program that might have returned him
sale value.  What business models create niches in which open-source
development can flourish?</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s04.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s06.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">The ``Information Wants to be Free'' Myth </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Reasons for Closing Source</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
