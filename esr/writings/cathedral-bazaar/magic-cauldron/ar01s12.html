widespread practice have more to do with customer demand and market
pressures than with supply-side efficiencies for vendors.  I have
already discussed, from the vendor's point of view, the effects of
customer demand for reliability and for infrastructure with no single
dominant player, and how these have played out historically in the
evolution of networking.  There is more to be said, though, about the
behavior of customers in a market where open source is a
factor.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Put yourself for the moment in the position of a CTO at a
Fortune 500 corporation contemplating a build or upgrade of your
firm's IT infrastructure.  Perhaps you need to choose a network
operating system to be deployed enterprise-wide; perhaps your concerns
involve 24/7 web service and e-commerce; perhaps your business depends
on being able to field high-volume, high-reliability transaction
databases.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Suppose you go the conventional closed-source route.  If you do,
then you put your firm at the mercy of a supplier
monopoly&#8212;because by definition, there is only one place you can
go for support, bug fixes, and enhancements.  If the supplier doesn't
perform, you will have no effective recourse because you are
effectively locked in by your initial investment and training costs.
Your supplier knows this.  Under these circumstances, do you suppose
the software will change to meet <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">your</i></span> needs and
<span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">your</i></span> business plan...or your
<span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">supplier's</i></span> needs and your
<span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">supplier's</i></span> business plan?</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The brutal truth is this: when your key business processes are
executed by opaque blocks of bits that you can't even see inside (let
alone modify) <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">you have lost control of your
business</i></span>. You need your supplier more than your supplier
needs you&#8212;and you will pay, and pay, and pay again for that power
imbalance.  You'll pay in higher prices, you'll pay in lost
opportunities, and you'll pay in lock-in that grows worse over time as
the supplier (who has refined its game on a lot of previous victims)
tightens its hold.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Contrast this with the open-source choice.  If you go that
route, <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> you have the source code</i></span>, and no one can
take it away from you. Instead of a supplier monopoly with a chokehold
on your business, you now have multiple service companies bidding for
your business&#8212;and you not only get to play them against each other,
you have the option of building your own captive support organization
if that looks less expensive than contracting out.  The market works
for <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">you</i></span>.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The logic is compelling; depending on closed source code is an
unacceptable strategic business risk.  So much so that I believe it
will not be very long until closed-source single-vendor acquisitions
when there is an open-source alternative available will be viewed as
actual fiduciary irresponsibility, and rightly grounds for a
shareholder lawsuit.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s11.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s13.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Open Source as a Strategic Weapon </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> The Business Ecology of Open Source</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
