transition is complete?</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some programmers worry that the transition to open source will abolish
or devalue their jobs.  The standard nightmare is what I call the
``Open Source Doomsday'' scenario. This starts with the market value
of software going to zero because of all the free source code out
there. Use value alone doesn't attract enough consumers to support
software development. The commercial software industry
collapses. Programmers starve or leave the field. Doomsday arrives
when the open-source culture itself (dependent on the spare time of
all these pros) collapses, leaving nobody around who can program
competently. All die. Oh, the embarrassment!</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We have already observed a number of sufficient reasons this won't
happen, starting with the fact that most developers' salaries don't
depend on software sale value in the first place. But the very best
one, worth emphasizing here, is this: when did you last see a software
development group that didn't have way more than enough
work waiting for it?  In a swiftly changing world, in a rapidly 
complexifying and information-centered economy, there will always
be plenty of work and a healthy demand for people who can make
computers do things&#8212;no matter how much time and how many
secrets they give away.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For purposes of examining the software market itself, it will be
helpful to sort kinds of software by how completely the service they
offer is describable by open technical standards, which is well
correlated with how commoditized the underlying service has
become.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This axis corresponds reasonably well to what people are normally
thinking when they speak of `applications' (not at all commoditized,
weak or nonexistent open technical standards), `infrastructure'
(commoditized services, strong standards), and `middleware' (partially
commoditized, effective but incomplete technical standards).  The
paradigm cases today in 2000 would be a word processor (application),
a TCP/IP stack (infrastructure), and a database engine (middleware).</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The payoff analysis we did earlier suggests that infrastructure,
applications, and middleware will be transformed in different ways and
exhibit different equilibrium mixes of open and closed source.  It
also suggested the prevalence of open source in a particular software
area would be a function of whether substantial network effects
operate there, what the costs of failure are, and to what extent the
software is a business-critical capital good.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We can venture some predictions if we apply these heuristics not to
individual products but to entire segments of the software market.
Here we go:</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Infrastructure (the Internet, the Web, operating systems, and the
lower levels of communications software that has to cross boundaries
between competing parties) will be almost all open source,
cooperatively maintained by user consortia and by for-profit
distribution/service outfits with a role like that of Red Hat today.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Applications, on the other hand, will have the most tendency to remain
closed.  There will be circumstances under which the use value of an
undisclosed algorithm or technology will be high enough (and the costs
associated with unreliability will be low enough, and the risks
associated with a supplier monopoly sufficiently tolerable) that
consumers will continue to pay for closed software.  This is likeliest
to remain true in standalone vertical-market applications where
network effects are weak.  Our lumber-mill example earlier is one
such; biometric identification software seems likeliest, of 1999's hot
prospects, to be another.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Middleware (like databases, development tools, or the customized top
ends of application protocol stacks) will be more mixed.  Whether
middleware categories tend to go closed or open seems likely to depend
on the cost of failures, with higher cost creating market pressure for
more openness.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To complete the picture, however, we need to notice that neither
`applications' nor `middleware' are really stable categories.  Earlier
we saw that individual software technologies seem to go through a
natural life cycle from rationally closed to rationally open.  The
same logic applies in the large.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Applications tend to fall into middleware as standardized
techniques develop and portions of the service are commoditized.
(Databases, for example, became middleware after SQL decoupled front
ends from engines.)  As middleware services are commoditized, they
will in turn tend to fall into the open-source infrastructure&#8212;a
transition we're seeing in operating systems right now.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a future that includes competition from open source, we can expect
that the eventual destiny of any software technology will be to either
die or become part of the open infrastructure itself.  While this is
hardly happy news for entrepreneurs who would like to collect rent on
closed software forever, it does suggest that the software industry as
a whole will <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">remain</i></span> entrepreneurial, with new niches
constantly opening up at the upper (application) end and a limited
lifespan for closed-IP monopolies as their product categories fall
into infrastructure.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, of course, this equilibrium will be great for the
software consumers who are driving the process.  More and more
high-quality software will become permanently available to use and
build on instead of being discontinued or locked in somebody's vault.
Ceridwen's magic cauldron is, finally, too weak a
metaphor&#8212;because food is consumed or decays, whereas software
sources potentially last forever. The free market, in its widest
libertarian sense including <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">all</i></span> un-coerced
activity whether trade or gift, can produce perpetually increasing
software wealth for everyone.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s16.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s18.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Getting There From Here </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Afterword: Why Closing a Driver Loses Its Vendor Money</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
