The underprovision problem would in fact scale linearly with number of
users if we assumed programming talent to be uniformly distributed in
the project user population as it expands over time.  This is not,
however, the case.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The incentives discussed in <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="ar01s20.html#HtN">[HtN]</a>
(and some more conventionally economic ones as well) imply that
qualified people tend to seek projects that match their interests, as
well as the projects seeking them. Accordingly, theory suggests (and
experience tends to confirm) that the most valuable (most qualified
and motivated) people tend to discover the projects for which they fit
well relatively early in the projects' life cycles, with a
corresponding fall-off later on.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hard data are lacking, but on the basis of experience I strongly
suspect the assimilation of talent over a growing project's lifetime
tends to follow a classical logistic curve.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="SH"/><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">[SH]</i></span>

Note for accountants: the argument that service costs will eventually
swamp a fixed up-front price still works if we move from constant
dollars to discounted present value, because future sale revenue
discounts in parallel with future service costs.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A similar but more sophisticated counter to the argument is to
observe that, per-copy, service cost will go to zero when the buyer
stops using the software; therefore you can still win, if the user
stops before he/she has generated too much service cost.  This is
basically just another form of the argument that factory pricing
rewards the production of shelfware.  Perhaps a more instructive way
to put it would be that the risk that your service costs will swamp
the purchase revenue rises with the expected period of usefulness of
the software.  Thus, the factory model penalizes quality.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="WG"/><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">[WG]</i></span>
Wayne Gramlich &gt;Wayne@Gramlich.Net&lt; has proposed that the
persistance of the factory model is partly due to antiquated
accounting rules, formulated when machines and buildings were more
important and people less so.  Software company books show the
computers, office furniture, and buildings as assets and the
programmers as expenses.  Or course, in reality, the programmers are
the true assets and the computers, office equipment, and buildings
hardly matter at all.  This perverse valuation is sustained by IRS and
stockmarket pressure for stable and uniform accounting rules that
reduce the complexity of assigning a dollar figure to the company's
value.  The resulting drag has prevented the rules from keeping up
with reality.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On this view, pinning a high price to the bits in the product
(independent of future service value) is partly a sort of defense
mechanism, a way of agreeing for all parties involved to pretend that
the ontological ground hasn't fallen out from under the standard
accounting rules.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(Gramlich also points out that these rules underpin the bizarre and
often self-destructive acquisition sprees that many software companies
tear off on after IPO.  ``Usually the software company issues some
additional stock to build up a war chest.  But they can't spend any of
this money to beef up their programming staff, because the accounting
rules would show that as increased expenses.  Instead, the newly
public software company has to grow by acquiring other software
companies, because the accounting rules let you treat the acquisition
as an investment.'')</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="SSH"/>For a paradigmatic example of forking following
