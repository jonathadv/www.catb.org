<h1 class="c1">The Adventure of the Cutty Sark</h1>

<div class="c2"><small><em>(Originally written 29 Nov 1999,<br />
with fans of Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin sea stories in
mind.)</em></small></div>

<p>There's a stiff southerly wind on this early Sunday afternoon as
I make all plain sail out of the Marlborough Hotel in central
London. My course is set for the National Maritime Museum at
Greenwich. The hotel concierge (resplendent in gold facings fit for
an admiral, though his uniform is a most unseamanlike port-wine
color) has informed me that the new Jubilee tube line out to
Greenwich is still teething and unreliable on Sundays. He tells me
the best way there is still, for all love, by boat from Westminster
Pier.</p>

<p>On the way south to the pier my double-decker bus, moving
handsomely in the dense London traffic, passes Trafalgar Square.
The four bronze lions around Nelson's column look as imperial as
ever. Even in this brisk weather the square is alive with people
taking the air, but they are as usual greatly outnumbered by the
pigeons.</p>

<p>A few blocks later the frowning facade of Westminster Cathedral
looms on the right. I inquire of the coachman and discover that
I've missed my landfall at the last stop and must tack back towards
the pier on foot. It is nearly one and I have been told the boats
leave on the half-hour; there is not a moment to be lost. I take my
bearings on the giant ferris wheel which, I vaguely recall, lies
across the river from here.</p>

<p>As I pass the Houses of Parliament, I hear gulls shrieking. This
time it is they who are outnumbered, by the flocks of tourists
unaccountably collected about the Westminster Abbey gates. The
Abbey is closed for the weekend; the chattering crowd gazes
wistfully through the wrought-iron fence as if they've all somehow
misplaced a day or two and are vaguely stupified in
consequence.</p>

<p>I sail through them serene in the confidence that whatever my
manifold other failings may be, I at least do not look like one of
these poor lost sheep. My course takes me hard by the very base of
Big Ben, the gilt around its clockfaces looking freshly-laid
against the age-darkened stonework. It strikes the hour of one
behind me as I make my way down to the boats.</p>

<p>Alas, I have just missed the last boarding on the one o'clock
boat; perhaps I am a lost sheep after all. It sits mere feet from
me, not rocking at all in the Thames swell, but we are sundered by
a hateful fence. A waterman in a navy-blue jersey confirms that
they are full up. He actually uses the word "guv'nor". I
marvel.</p>

<p>Now I have time and to spare, alas. The next boat will leave at
one forty. I rig out my laptop and begin making observations. When
the one-forty boat docks I seize a prime spot in the open-air seats
at the bows. She casts off a few minutes later. Down the river, we
are treated to humorous narration which, to my surprise,
<em>is</em> actually both humorous and informative.</p>

<p>As I listen, I begin to suspect the narrator may have been
selected for his rich Cockney accent, but he tells us later that he
is not a professional guide. He is one of the boat crew and they
write their own patter, complete with jokes about ex-wives and the
Traitor's Gate.</p>

<p>At Blackfriars Bridge, the guide does <em>not</em> mention its
most interesting bit of history -- the banker found hung from it by
a rope back in the nineteen-eighties, in connection with the Banco
Ambrosiano scandal. Though I don't recall it was ever proved, the
manner of the murder was ritualistic with details that pointed
straight at that most hoary of paranoid cliches, a Masonic
conspiracy. Shortly afterward the P1 Lodge in Italy, a Masonic
organization which included a number of that country's most
prominent politicians and businessmen, was broken up amidst a
tremendous furore.</p>

<p>Off to our port the narrator points out the livery hall of the
Association of Master Mariners. To be a member, he tells us, one
must have held command of a ship at sea. Then he says their
president is the Duke of Edinburgh. The man, or the title, I wonder
-- and if the latter, has every peer of that line been a sailor?
Fittingly, their livery hall is a moored ship.</p>

<p>We hit a bit of chop at the Southwark Road Bridge, just after
passing the newly-erected replica of the Globe Theater on the south
bank. It gleams almost unnaturally white against the faded gray and
drab of the buildings around it. Another replica, of the Sir
Francis Drake's Golden Hind, passes our starboard beam a few
hundred yards later; with its old-fashioned high forecastle and
poop decks it looks like a child's toy boat mysteriously grown
large, and a little embarrassed at its own prominence. A little
after that we pass very close to the battlecruiser Belfast. This
far larger and grimmer-looking hulk is, we are told, a veteran of
the Murmansk convoys, D-Day, and the sinking of the Scharnhorst. It
looms over the tour boat like a steel cliff.</p>

<p>A mile or so after the Tower Bridge we begin to plough through a
more serious chop. The loquacious waterman has finished his spiel;
I drop him a a tip when he wanders by, captain's hat in hand. What
he'll do with my handful of Irish small coin left over from Dublin,
I'm not sure, but it's about all I have in my pockets. It's full
ahead now; the engines' barely audible muttering becomes a muted
roar.</p>

<p>The boat churns on towards Greenwich. I am writing in real time
now, glancing from my laptop screen to the green-grey river. We're
out of old London now; the banks are lined not with historic
buildings but with ugly flats and warehouses. I'm increasingly glad
of the bulky Icelandic sweater my wife gave me before I left; it
was made for just this sort of raw day and is serving well.
Nevertheless I contemplate going aft for a hot drink. But as I am
thinking this, the boat noses into Greenwich pier.</p>

<p>It is a quarter to three, alarmingly late in the day considering
the Maritime Museum closes at 5:00; but worse is to come when I
discover that the last return boat leaves at 4:20. I would get
little more than an hour at the Museum for my seven pounds
admission, and I've been there before. I contemplate the thought of
sea-battle paintings and ship models with regret, but decide in
favor of novelty to divert to the Cutty Sark.</p>

<p>The famous ship reposes majestically in a drydock a few yards
from the river. Her hull is black, her masts stark white. Her yards
are unhistorically crossed; the brightwork at her bow and stern
gleams, and her figurehead is an amusingly archetypical
bare-bosomed goddess. I walked around the ship slowly, drinking in
the sight of her. Her standing rigging seems to thrum in the
afternoon wind; a Red Ensign flutters bravely at her mizzen.</p>

<p>The fastest ship of her day, that Cockney waterman had claimed,
and I can believe it. Even at rest in a drydock she <em>looks</em>
fast. A few weeks ago I walked the decks of the heavy frigate
Constitution on a fine fall day in Boston; that was an impressive
ship and by all accounts a good sailer, but obviously a war-dog
with nowhere near the speed of this sleek greyhound.</p>

<p>The Cutty Sark was, indeed, one of the prize blooms in the last
and loveliest flowering of the age of sail. She was launched in
1869 for the tea trade -- and those ships had to be fast, because
in those days before refrigeration and cheap hermetic sealing tea
did not travel well. The precious leaves became weary, stale, flat,
and unprofitable after too long in hold. The fastest and most
beautiful sailing ships ever made were built so Londoners could
have a fresh cuppa in the morning.</p>

<p>Indeed, the Cutty Sark probably owes her survival and good
condition to the fact that she became obsolete soon after she was
built. Fulton's and Brunel's ugly steam kettles soon surpassed her.
With her passed the age of sail; the world would not see her like
again.</p>

<p>Her grace and keenness puts me in mind of the Gokstad and
Oseberg ships, which I saw at the Viking Ship Museum in Oslo just
last week. They're a thousand years older; longships in the classic
clinker-built Norse style, with steering boards and just one square
sail. And yet, they breathe the same sense of perfected craft, of
design wisdom and exquisite functional fitness that the Cutty Sark
does.</p>

<p>And they show it in the same way; with breathtaking beauty. The
cruciform white building the Norwegians erected to house these
ships has the hush of a temple. And rightly so; the ships seem a
living presence as surely as the holiest idol or icon ever carved,
and more surely than most. "The men who made and sailed us
<em>knew</em> the sea..." they say...and the zoomorphic interlace
carving on their prows does not, after all, seem that different in
spirit from the brightwork on the Cutty Sark's. Both the products
of loving hands, of shipwrights and artisans rightly proud of their
skill.</p>

<p>For all that I'm on a promotional tour for a book about software
development, the last week could hardly have been better designed
to reveal the time-deep history of men going down to the sea in
ships. Just four days ago I was in Dublin, an invited lecturer at
Trinity College. I made time to go to the National Museum while I
was there; and off to one side of all the cases of gorgeous gold
jewelry from the Bronze Age, there is a boat almost four thousand
years old. It's an immense log dugout canoe, hollowed out by fire
and adze, nearly thirty feet long. Crude but serviceable, it and
the Cutty Sark neatly bracket the age of muscle- and wind-power at
sea.</p>

<p>I'm quite taken aback when I discover at the entrance to the
Cutty Sark's interior that I am short five pounds of the admission
price. I am not lacking money, but they don't take dollars and the
guard doubts I'll find anywhere to change dollars on a Sunday in
Greenwich.</p>

<p>Now I am a lost sheep indeed. Not only are my chances of seeing
the Cutty Sark's interior looking slim, but the sea wind has done
its work on me and I'm getting devilish hungry. Sharp-set, I fare
forth into Greenwich in search of anyone who will take my dollars
in trade for coin of the realm.</p>

<p>Aubrey and Maturin would feel right at home in the cobblestoned,
twisting streets of Greenwich town. If you edit out the throngs of
tourists and the cars, not much has changed in essence since their
day, I suspect. Though my quest appears increasingly futile, I do
not fail to enjoy the warren of pubs, little eateries, and
hole-in-the-wall shops. The smells from the eateries increasingly
tantalize me.</p>

<p>One place where I inquire deals in old books and maps. I imagine
the Doctor sniffing about here for books of natural history, and
eye a three-hundred-year-old map of the Netherlands offered for
sixty pounds. Alas, I cannot linger. My return boat will leave
soon, I have not yet given up hope of changing some dollars, and I
am very hungry.</p>

<p>I'm also cursing the amiable, potty inefficiency about matters
economic that the British have retained along with their
cobblestoned streets. Greenwich is clearly a place that lives off
the tourist trade; to optimally separate the marks from their
money, there ought to be a bureau de change on every other corner.
Instead, the locals look vague and puzzled at my frustration, as if
they don't understand the issue and can't be bothered to try.</p>

<p>This shouldn't surprise me; I've lived in this country, after
all. I'm all too familiar with related phenomena like restaurants
only open at hours when, seemingly, nobody actually wants to eat.
But it never ceases to amaze me how blind the people once famously
described as "a nation of shopkeepers" can be to a potential
profit.</p>

<p>A few minutes after the bookshop I pass a pub emitting the
surprising (here and now, at any rate) sound of Dixieland jazz. I
peer through a window. Sure enough, a trio is playing live -- and
not badly, either. But I cannot tarry here either. I make my way
through a lively open-air market in a back alley. The streets are
packed with cheerful people, but it is time for me to head back
towards the pier. If I miss the last boat to Westminster I'll be in
real trouble.</p>

<p>On my way I duck into a Middle-Eastern take-out restaurant
because it looks inexpensive enough that my couple of pounds might
actually buy a meal. Thankfully, it does. I munch my kebab and
think of chelengks. It is hot and good.</p>

<p>I catch the last boat with no difficulty. In the queue, I strike
up a conversation with a man who turns out to be a Scotsman living
in Italy. He trades bits of Italian with his dark-eyed wife. He is
in the telecommunications business, intrigued by my handy little
Sony VAIO computer (not surprisingly; it is very new and on top of
being exceedingly light and powerful it is beautifully designed --
I often get strangers asking about it). We talk of modern
technology, but I think of Dr. Maturin and smile; here is a Celt
who has found his own Catalonia.</p>

<p>The journey upriver is uneventful. Indeed, we make twenty
minutes' better time than downriver; a crewman mentions that we are
with the tide. Fashion engines how we will, old mother sea is still
more than a match for them, and where rivers like the Thames run
her reach is long into the land. All the ships I've seen today are
in the nature of propositions to her; but only she can say if she
will dance.</p>
