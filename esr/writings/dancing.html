<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Dancing With The Gods</H1>

<p>An autobiographical account of my `religious' beliefs and how they got
that way.  If you start this, please read it through.  Stopping
partway would probably leave you with some <em>very</em> silly
misconceptions.

<hr>

<p>I was raised Catholic by a Catholic father and a relaxed Protestant
mother.  I had my first mystical experience in 1967 at the age of 10,
at an old-style Latin Tridentine mass in the hills outside Rome, as
the priests were censing the aisle of the church during the Offertory.
It presented itself as a sudden, intense sense of being in a moment
outside time, an eternal instant co-existing with every other eternal
instants of history, with the illusion of time and change stripped
away. "As it was in the Beginning, is now, and ever shall be, World
without End, amen" conveys the flavor exactly.

<p>I was aware even at the time that this experience was inside my head, induced
by the Mass but not specifically Christian in content.

<p>From an early age I was exposed to, and very interested in, skeptical/
scientific accounts of the world.  Reichenbach's "The Rise of Scientific
Philosophy" and Korzybski's General Semantics taught me to value evidence,
logic, and rationality.

<p>On Thanksgiving Night of my twelfth year, as I was being offered the
sip of sherry my family hauled out for the kids at holiday meals, I made
the first major spiritual commitment of my life.  I realized that the
religion I'd grown up in was like the wine -- attractive but cumulatively
toxic, promising exaltation but delivering the death of reason.

<p>I quietly refused the wine.  I am a teetotaler to this day, refusing
not only wine but psychoactive drugs of all sorts (I do drink tea, which
affects me very little).  With it, I renounced -- and swore enmity to --
not only my birth religion but any other form of belief founded on
faith and soi-disant `revelation', as opposed to evidence and reason.

<p>For years after that I was militantly and indiscriminately anti-religious.
Spending ninth through twelfth grade at a Catholic school hardly
discouraged this :-).  I read the Bible and the Koran and the Upanishads
and the Egyptian and Tibetan Books of the Dead and found them wanting.  I
developed all the attitudes, knowledges, and ignorances of an Enlightenment
philosophe.  I read Voltaire and Russell.  And drank no wine.

<p>Sometime early this period I was first exposed to Hindu and Buddhist mysticism.
It was immediately apparent to me that (ignoring the religious stuff) there was
interesting content there.  I consciously experimented with meditative
techniques, treating them as a sort of mental calisthenics in an effort to
alter and broaden my perceptions.  (This was the early Seventies; people were
still wearing bellbottoms and peace symbols, and the hippie "doors of
perception" thing was still very much part of the Zeitgeist.)

<p>My second major mystical experience was a successful though unexpected result
of one of one of these experiments.  It happened on a school bus at about 3:30
on a fall afternoon, I think in 1972.  I had been attempting to visualize a
larger and larger range of distance scales in the cosmos, from angstroms to
megaparsecs.  I was holding in my mind vibrating hydrogen atoms and galactic
clusters, and I tried to push further in both directions.  And something
happened -- something that was a bit like seeing the point of a joke, a bit
like an orgasm, and a bit like being pinned by powerful headlights.  I believe
it was a classic satori, ego-death, consciousness of All (though I did not
understand those terms or their implications until years later).

<p>By the time I entered college in 1976, I felt I had learned most of
what I could from such mind-games.  Lest you get the wrong impression,
they had never been a major interest for me.  For every minute I spent
thinking or reading about religion or mysticism, I undoubtedly spent
thirty devouring huge amounts of science, history, philosophy, and
mathematics. (No, I didn't have much of a life!  I was a skinny, runty
kid with cerebral palsy and few social skills, fanatically devoted to
improving my mind because it was the only part of me that seemed to
work right. I was all hungry intellect and raging hormones :-))

<p>I had filed the whole topic away as interesting but not worth a lot of my
time -- not likely to produce scientifically replicable results and too
close to what I saw as the huge, nasty mind-mangling traps for the stupid
and credulous otherwise known as `conventional religions'.  I had grown --
I readily admit it -- rather smug in my enlightenment, quick to dismiss
religiosity and mysticism in general as a sort of childhood neurosis of the
species, to be abandoned by any rational individual and eventually by
everybody as we march forward into the light of secular scientific
understanding.

<p>Anyone who can't predict from the above that my complacency was soon to
be shattered has no ear for irony...

<p>When I was in my junior year in high school, I had started learning how
to play guitar.  Unfortunately, it was my sister's guitar.  My interest
rekindled hers, and she reclaimed it just about the time I entered college,
during that itchy period you get while learning when you <em>have</em> to play,
every day.  Desperate for something to feed my jones, I snaffled my other
sister's abandoned flute.

<p>And <em>wow</em>!  I was a natural...immediately better with it than with the
guitar I'd been hacking at for months.  I was commuting to college at
the time, and took it with me.  I'd play as I walked between classes. Six
weeks from a cold standing start I sat in with a professional jazz band
for the first time...and they <em>liked</em> it.

<p>This was delightful but mystifying.  All I'd had to do was learn to play
a scale, and this amazing river of music poured forth with barely an effort
on my part.  It seemed almost as though my hands and lips had always known
what to do, had been waiting for me to pick up the flute.  

<p>Something happened to me when I played that instrument.  The angry, anxious,
frustrated adolescent kid I was then just disappeared.  I was powerful,
competent, passionate.  And I got these stunning rushes of pure timeless joy,
when my consciousness seemed to expand outwards from the limits of my skin to
fill the universe and I could no longer tell whether I was playing the
music or the music was playing me.

<p>Nor were these effects just going on inside my own head.

<p>At the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Anthropology there's a large,
circular domed chamber in the Oriental wing with a skylight at its apex.
Directly underneath that skylight they display the second largest
natural-crystal globe in the world, a flawless five-inch sphere on a silver
stand in the form of a dragon.  I found it there one day with the sun shining
full on it.  Feeling utterly compelled, I ran ten blocks and back to get my
flute, gazed into it, and started playing.

<p>I don't know how long I played.  When I was aware of the world again,
echoes were dying away in the high dome, and a dozen or so people were
lined up at the four entrances, keeping <em>absolutely</em> still.
Rather stupidly, I said "Why are you all standing there?" thinking
that if they'd wanted to listen they certainly could have entered the
room.  And a man said "We didn't want to interrupt you..." in a
hushed, totally awed tone of voice that embarrassed me no end.  We all
looked at each other like we'd been caught in some weird intimacy in
public.  I mumbled something and fled.

<p>And this kind of thing <em>kept happening</em>.  Without my intention.
Without my understanding it.  Until the girl on the landing.

<p>I was climbing the stair to the fourth floor in one of the quad houses one
day, to visit some friends.  A girl stepped onto the landing, saw me, and
turned white as a sheet.  I said something obvious along the lines of "Why are
you looking at me like that?"

<p>She started to babble something about last week when she was studying, looking
outside at the quad and seeing me walk by "...and the leaves were following
you!"  And it was like I was the Spring and the life in the grass.  And a
whole bunch of other stuff that made me wonder what drugs she'd been doing
(this was 1976 or early '77; every second dorm room had a bong and blotter
acid was easier to score than good music).  So I shook my head dubiously and
rolled on upstairs and visited my buddies.

<p>I was walking home, idly puzzling over this peculiar incident, and damn
near fell over when I finally got it.  That girl had been trying to cope
with a theophany; she had looked at me and seen a god.  A particular god.
And I knew, suddenly, with utter shattering certainty, which one it was.
And that it probably was not the first time I had inadvertently triggered
such an experience, and would almost certainly not be the last.

<p>You have to understand that I was not happy about this at the time.  I'd known
the score since my early teens; religion was an instrument of oppression,
deities a delusion, mysticism a bag of sterile mind-games and somatic circus
tricks.  I didn't need any of it.  I was proud of not needing any of it.

<p>But I still had an omnivorous curiousity, and one of my friends was "into
the occult".  Had a chin beard, read Crowley, wore black turtlenecks.  He
loved to talk endlessly about Eastern mysticism and archetypal psychology,
shamanism, the organizing role of ritual, magic as mind-change,
metaprogramming (I sat for him once while he did LSD).  A minister's son;
turned into a Fundamentalist with an alcohol problem years later.  But he
was very educational at the time.  

<p>Thanks to him, I had started months before the girl on the landing to see
clearly what I'd only dimly grasped in my first pass at the subject; that
there is a kind of live internal logic to mysticism and religion, something
entwined with psychology that sends runners and shoots all through culture and
art.

<p>Not that I took any of it seriously as a description of the real world.  It
was an intellectual chew-toy, perhaps at best a way of understanding the
pathologies that prevented human beings from living the infinitely more
desirable life of reason and science.

<p>Until I realized, finally, belatedly, what had been happening to me.  Until
the Great God Pan reached out of my hindbrain and thundered "YOU!"  And his
gift is music and his chosen instruments the pipes and flutes.  And his, too
the power of joy; magic so strong that when it flowed out of me, even before I
knew what I was doing, it amazed people into awe and incoherence and poetry.

<p>That day I was reborn; from a skinny lame kid with a flute into a shaman and a
vessel of the Goat-Foot God, the Piper at the Gates of Dawn, the Horned Lord.
And the music was my first power, but not my last.

<p>(And, oh, yes.  The first time I handled a set of pan-pipes I could play them.
Fluently.  Effortlessly.  And knew I could before I touched them.)

<p>During the next several months I went through a wrenching re-adjustment of
my world-view as I assimilated what I have just related here.  There was simply
no way it would fit in either the religious categories I'd grown up with or
the comfortable, naive materialism I had constructed for myself.  I clung to
the conviction that I live in a rational, explicable universe -- but the
Gods had spoken and after that transforming moment of realization I could no
more go back than a butterfly could crawl back into its cocoon.

<p>I knew I wasn't crazy, even by my own rather strict definition of
sanity.  I was coping pretty well -- in fact, I was becoming a whole
human being for the first time in my life.  Opening up emotionally.
Playing beautiful music.  And ... um ... getting laid.  (Well, what do
you <em>think</em> happens when you start channelling the freaking God
of Sex Himself? :-))

<p>So I coped.  I read Jung and Crowley myself.  I gradually learned how to 
evoke Pan in myself nearly at will.  I constructed a world-view in which the
forces I experienced fit within the natural order of science, as what Jung
called "archetypes of the collective unconscious".  I rejected supernatural
explanations, but learned to believe in magic -- the magic of the human mind
and hand and heart.

<p>Here is what I learned:

<p>All the Gods are alive.  They are not supernatural; rather, they are our
inmost natures.  They power our dreams and our art and our personalities.
Theurgy and ritual can make them stronger, more accessible to the shaman.
They can be evoked in a human being to teach, heal, inspire, or harm.
Occasionally they manifest in spontaneous theophanies; the result may be
religious conversion, creative inspiration, charisma, or madness.

<p>Magic is loose in the world.  It is not the magic of fantasy -- no would-be
violators of the laws of physics need apply.  Real magic acts in and through
human agents.  The two forms of practical magic are healing and divination.
Healing works because human minds have more control over their bodies than
we normally think; divination works because humans know and perceive more 
than they are consciously aware of.

<p>The mode of the religious is faith.  The mode of the mystic is experience.  We
do not enact rituals and promulgate dogmas to express our `faith' that the sun
rises in the east, because it is a fact of experience.  No more does a true
shaman or mystic invest faith in the god(s) he or she invokes; they too are
facts of experience.  The elevation of `faith' is, in fact, a sign that a
religious tradition is losing its ability to induce theophany, or has already
lost it.

<p>More generally, allegiance to fixed religious forms reliably murders true
religious experience.  Descriptive theology ("Oh, yeah, Hermes and Thoth
are basically equivalent...") is worth doing; prescriptive theology is at
best a waste of time and at worst an invitation to holocaust.  The Gods
personify everything humans have ever imagined as sacred.  Good things, bad
things, and occasionally jokes that got out of control.  They're all
in there, all waiting to be tapped.

<p>The Gods taught me these things while I was being some of them.  Usually I've
been the Horned Lord (Pan/Cernunnos/Freyr/Krishna).  Occasionally I've been
the Trickster (Coyote/Mercury/Loki/Eris) or the Sage (Thoth/Merlin).  Just
once, by accident in a martial-arts class, I have been the Warrior
(Thor/Indra/Cuchulain).

<p>But I'm getting ahead of my narrative.  It wasn't till the early '80s that
I learned how to invoke gods other than the Horned One.

<p>In late 1977 a woman I was involved with, who'd seen some of my odd gifts
in action and shared something of my developing understanding of them,
invited me to go up to New York City with her to meet some friends.  She
was singularly mysterious about them, and kept smiling as though she knew
something I didn't.

<p>She did.  They were a Wiccan coven called Blue Star.  And they knew what I
was.  They'd seen it before.  And they had a whole technology for raising
the God Pan and his triune Goddess and exploiting those altered states,
that I hadn't known existed.

<p>Now, understand, I hadn't thought of myself as a witch up to then.  To the
extent I labeled myself at all, I thought of myself as a shaman or
experimental mystic.  I didn't use ritual induction (no need).  I didn't
work with other people.  I knew very little about Wicca.

<p>They showed me that the imagery and energy I'd stumbled into using on my own
was part of a larger picture; that it fit the mythology of Wicca and animated
its ritual forms.  They showed me that I was a natural witch, albeit of a kind
uncommon in this century.  Most spontaneous Wiccan theophanies happen to women.
For a man to spontaneously channel the Goat-foot God before training is
unusual, though not unheard-of.

<p>So I decided I was a witch -- or, at least, that I was willing to play with
the Wiccans.  Nothing else resembling a live religious tradition seemed to
have any room in its categories for my experience.  And they were completely
comfortable with my scientific skepticism.  "Do what works," was the attitude,
"worry about explanations after you leave the ritual circle."

<p>Subsequently, I made numerous friends in the neo-pagan movement.  (The
Wiccans are the largest single group in that movement.)  I went to
many festivals, and founded and ran a coven of my own for six years in
the 1980s.  I became a respected priest, elder, and bard.  I developed
something of a reputation as a ritual designer and theoretician.  And
out of me flowed poetry and healing and inspiration, and by these
signs I knew and others knew that the Gods moved and lived within me.

<p>I helped and trained and initiated many people myself, teaching them by
design skills I had discovered by accident.  There is a living Wiccan
lineage today (Tradition of the Rainbow Wheel) that calls me its founder
and still uses portions of the Book of Shadows I wrote.

<p>The original coven I founded broke up in 1986 under circumstances that
aren't relevant here, but which turned me off of group work for a while.
By the time I was ready to become active again, my life had become filled
with other challenges.

<p>While I still use the gifts of the Horned God, and identify with neopagans,
and do the odd bit of practical magic now and then, these days most of my
spiritual life is wound up in my martial arts training.  I've once again
become very interested in Zen Buddhism, enough to read primary sources and
seriously consider doing dokusan and the whole monastic-retreat thing at
someplace like the Mountain Zen Center in Vermont.  I may do it yet.

<p>Zen represents a return to my earliest, non-theurgic mystical experiences
as a child.  Zen is very ... clean.  It doesn't have the practical utility
or drama or sexiness of the neopagan path.  But there is one thing it does
better; it strips away illusions.  To experience things as they are, just
as they are, without the drunken monkey of the mind perpetually layering
them over with expectations and interpetations and preconceptions and
yammering till you can't hear yourself be -- that is the Great Way of Zen.

<p>There's my experience.  Now some theory for you skeptical types out there.

<p>If my language is too "religious" for you, feel free to transpose it
all into the key of psychology.  Speak of archetypes and semi-independent
complexes.  Feel free to hypothesize that I've merely learned how to
enter some non-ordinary mental states that change my body language, disable a
few mental censors, and have me putting out signals that other people
interpret in terms of certain material in their own unconscious minds.

<p>Fine.  You've explained it.  Correctly, even.  But you can't <em>do</em> it!

<p>And as long as you stick with the sterile denotative language of
psychology, and the logical mode of the waking mind, you won't be able to
--- because you can't reach and program the unconscious mind that way.  It
takes music, symbolism, sex, hypnosis, wine and strange drugs, firelight
and chanting, ritual and magic.  Super-stimuli that reach past the
conscious mind and neocortex, in and back to the primate and mammal and
reptile brains curled up inside.

<p>Rituals are programs written in the symbolic language of the unconscious
mind.  Religions are program libraries that share critical subroutines.
And the Gods represent subystems in the wetware being programmed.  All
humans have potential access to pretty much the same major gods because
our wetware design is 99% shared.

<p>Only...that cold and mechanistic a way of thinking about the Gods simply
will not work when you want to evoke one.  For full understanding,
the Apollonian/scientific mode is essential; for direct experience,
the Dionysian/ecstatic mode is the only way to go.

<p>One great virtue of this dual explanation is that it removes the need for
what William James, in his remarkable "The Varieties of Religious
Experience", called the "objective correlative".  By identifying the Gods
with shared features of our psychological and inter-subjective experience,
but being willing to dance with them on their own terms in the ritual
circle, we can explain religious experience in respectful and non-reductive
ways without making any anti-rational commitments about history or
cosmology.  Scientific method cannot ultimately be reconciled with
religious faith, but it can get along with experiential mysticism just
fine.

<p>This much I figured out early, by 1979 or so.  Later, I learned some more
things:

<p>Primary mystical experiences like mine are common.  A study by two British
sociologists I read once seems to have shown that they are widespread in the
general population, though perhaps more common in children and adolescents.
Our culture provides very little context or language for such experiences,
however; they are not generally categorized or recognized by the subjects as
`spiritual', and are commonly undervalued and forgotten.

<p>Religions are, mostly, the rotting corpses of dead mystical schools.
They're founded by people who have primary mystical experiences or
theophanies and (for whatever reason) do not interpret the content of those
experiences into the terms of the religious traditions available around
them.  These primary mystics recruit disciples and attempt to teach them
how to replicate their theophany.

<p>Usually these founders (having neither training for nor interest in science
or analytic rigor) mistake the incidentals of the experience for its cause,
and teach induction methods which are only accidentally effective.  As time
goes by the induction methods accrete layers of ritual and dogma that crowd
out the theophanic aspect, and are adapted for other purposes.

<p>Very occasionally a charismatic mystic will arise within a religion
and strip away the dogmatic accretions, re-creating a living mystical
tradition.  Meister Eckhardt and George Fox did this in a Christian
context; the semi-mythical Sixth Patriarch of what was then the Dhyana
school seems to have done it in an early Mahayana Buddhist one.  The
movements they founded (the Pietists, Quakers and Zen) became
exemplary, but they were the exceptions.

<p>Most late-stage religions distrust mystics and lock them up in monasteries
or hermitages; they rightly fear the renewing but disruptive effect of 
theophany.  Eventually, for most of the religion's followers, even the
theoretical possibility of unmediated experience of the God(s) is lost,
or thought of as the preserve of specialists and madmen.

<p>And this decay impoverishes our spiritual lives.  It cheats most of us of
our birthright to the sacred lightning...

<p>And this is why I am implacably hostile to Christianity in particular
and the other Zoroastrian-offshoot religions in general.  Never mind
the fact that they have a long history of torturing pagans and mystics
like me to death, and I fear they will begin doing it again the second
they have the power.

<p>No...their crime in present time is that they are such tragic,
monstrous <em>cheats</em>.  They create huge chasms of disconnection
between us and our Gods, and then tell us that is inevitable because
we are `sinful'.  They associate the spiritual domain with so much
dogma, cant and irrational garbage that anyone with a functioning
brain has to either live in hypocrisy or reject the whole package --
and then wonder why life is so empty.  They warp the language of
spiritual discourse; they exert a sinister gravity on living
mysticisms, tending to remake them in their own diseased images.  In
the name of God, they strangle mystical experience; in the name of
love, they murder; in the name of truth, they tell lies.

<p>It doesn't have to be that way.  I have seen.  I have been.  I have known.
The mysterium tremendum is within reach of everyone, "closer to you" (as the
Koran puts it) "than the vein in your neck".

<p>To find it, it is only necessary that you abandon both the dogmatic
materialist prejudice that it's not there, and the dogmatic religious
preconception that you know what it is.  As the Buddha said from his
deathbed to his favorite disciple Ananda, "Have no fixed beliefs, and
find your own light."
