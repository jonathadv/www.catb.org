<p>I am sitting in a dance club being pummelled by bad techno
music. I have been awake for twenty-nine hours straight, ten and a
half of them spent crossing the Pacific. I am now in the land
beyond fatigue jag, full of brittle energy and knowing that I will
crash very hard within a few hours. It is the fourteenth of June in
the year 2000 and here I am in Seoul, Korea on the evening of the
same day that the presidents of North and South Korea exchanged
their unexpected first handshake &mdash; a fact which largely relieves
the concern I would otherwise feel about being less than fifty
miles from millions of heavily-armed Communist troops. To them,
today probably feels like history and hope. To me, it feels like
looking in a funhouse mirror.</p>

<p>There are about a dozen Korean girls in fluorescent white
gyrating under the dance floor lights with a couple of guys. If I
had either a language or a decade in common with those kids, I'm
thinking, I might go out there and even the odds a little. Instead
I study my companions.</p>

<p>There are about a dozen of us, too; Americans and Europeans
drawn to this foreign shore by `Global Linux 2000', the conference
I will be speaking at in two days' time. One of us, Joanne, is a
Korean-born American returned to her birth country to help haul it
into the Internet age. All of us agree that the music is wretched,
but Joanne's boss John is the kind of genially tipsy host that
wants everyone around him to be having as good a time as he is. He
is daring everybody to hit the dance floor. I would be much more
resistant to this idea if Joanne were not smiling at me. She is
very lovely, and dressed to the nines in black and red silk.</p>

<p>I'm thinking back to the trip in from the airport. I've done
enough traveling in the last two years to have learned to read a
city by the face it shows as you drive in. Airport routes aren't
calculated to take you through the local monuments to civic pride;
instead, you generally get a more realistic view of the bone and
sinew, where people work and live and make things. Seoul looks like
a pretty typical Asian capitol city &mdash; prosperous, bursting at the
seams, and sweltering under a blanket of smog as bad as LA in the
old days.</p>

<br />
<p class="centered"><img src="seoul-view.jpg" alt="View of Seoul" />
<br />Seoul</p>
<br />

<p>It's hard to avoid comparisons with Japan, though I know Koreans
would find them odious. Compared to Tokyo, Seoul seems a grim and
earnest place. Perhaps that comes from lower average wealth,
perhaps from having been within range of North Korean artillery for
forty-five years of armed truce. The people are on average smaller
and darker-complected than Japanese, but there is also more
variation in color than Japanese show and a few of the locals are
as light-skinned as northern Europeans. Overall Koreans are a
stocky, muscular, and tough-looking breed. And, as usual in Asia,
there are beautiful girls everywhere you turn around.</p>

<p>Seoul's modern buildings, even more than Tokyo's, are gray and
anonymous. What does the most to give the place a visual identity
is the graceful script on signs everywhere. Compared to the spidery
intricacies of Chinese or Japanese calligraphy, Korean hanggul
looks spare and functional and elegant. Koreans are very proud of
their hangul, which they claim is the most rationally-designed
system of writing in the world. They are arguably right, and would
certainly be right if Korean hadn't drifted in pronunciation during
the last four centuries since the hanggul were designed as a
perfect phonetic alphabet for it. As it is, they have competition
from the Latin-alphabet orthographies of Hawaiian and Finnish.</p>

<p>John finally teases a critical mass of us into moving. I follow
Joanne to the dance floor, regretting that the music is so mindless
but determined to give a decent account of myself. Fortunately the
DJ has an unexpected attack of taste a few minutes later and tracks
some latin-beat stuff &mdash; not Ricky Martin either, thank goodness,
but nice hot salsa. Joanne is game but obviously even less used to
dancing than I am. I teach her a simplified variation of the tango
step. By the time the music reverts to utter mindlessness I have
been awake for thirty-one hours continuous. I bid everyone adieu,
hug Joanne, and stumble back to my hotel to fall over.</p>

<p>Morning comes early in these parts; there is smog-tinted
sunlight pouring in my window at 5 am. I curse the photons and try
for a few hours' more sleep but give up a little before 7. I have
nothing planned for today, but the organizers had said by email
they would set up a bit of a tour for me, incuding a Buddhist
temple and the headquarters of the World Tae Kwon Do federation. I
don't know when this is to be, however; the organizers have been
notably sparing with details and I do not think there has been a
lot of pre-planning of anything.</p>

<p>After a quick breakfast, the first thing to do is find the
convention center. It turns out to be a colossus of modernism about
a block from my hotel. The interior is a series of vast caverns
gleaming with marble; it can readily support three or four
conventions at once, and is in fact doing so. Besides the Linux
conference, there is an international machinists' convention going
on, and at least two others with no English on their signs. The
girls at the help desks spotted around the place don't speak
English, but I manage to find Global Linux 2000 without too much
trouble. Joanne catches up with me on the escalators, looking
businesslike and demure in a gray suit.</p>

<p>On the way there I finally meet Ashley, the show organizer
responsible for my schedule. She turns out to be another one of the
astonishing local beauties, an intelligent, vivacious and outgoing
woman who I find out later used to be an airline stewardess. She
tells me my tour has been set up for two o'clock.</p>

<br />
<p class="centered"><img src="ashley1.jpg" alt="Picture of Ashley" />
<br />Ashley</p>
<br />

<p>The show floor is as noisy as the discotheque was, and for some
of the same reasons &mdash; though why exhibitors think it is effective
to plug their product with excessively-loud dance music, I don't
know. I make a beeline for the Greenhouse booth, where I'm told
they have a working Internet connections. They do, but a slow one
&mdash; and I have just short of 1200 email messages waiting. I begin to
plow through them.</p>

<p>I haven't made nearly enough progress when I decide I need to
break for lunch. I go hunting for the booth Joanne is working,
thinking I'll pry her loose and ask her to help me find some
traditional Korean lunch food. Before I find her, however, I bump
into about a half-dozen of the other show speakers also looking for
lunch. They tell me the show has issued them meal tickets for lunch
and hand me a couple. We hie off to the convention center's food
court.</p>

<p>And there it is, unamaginatively labeled "FOOD COURT" in
multicolored Roman letters. Inside, my efforts to buy lunch by
waving my meal tickets at the boys running a dim-sum booth lead
only to spates of Korean and finger-pointing. I wander around
feeling rather helpless and increasingly hungry until one of the
other show speakers who has grokked in fullness explains. Despite
the appearance that all these booths are separate enterprises, it
seems I'm actually supposed to take my order and my payment to a
central desk, where yet another smiling Korean girl will enter the
order and issue me a number. Only <em>then</em> do I go queue up at
the booth. Part of me wonders if this is a metaphor for Korean
society; most of me just wonders when I will actually get
lunch.</p>

<p>The dim-sum booth is out of the three dishes I would have found
interesting. An attempt to purchase Thai duck with red sauce comes
to nothing as I discover that (despite the menu) it is no longer
offered. I opt for bibimbap, a traditional Korean lunch dish which
I am told will include steamed rice, fried egg, vegetables, chili
paste and pork. It certainly includes something resembling cabbage
with a very tough and woody texture that demands an unpleasant
amount of chewing. The sweet Korean rice is good, but I am unable
to discover any trace of either chili paste or pork in my dish. I
had been teasing one of my companions about having ordered a
hamburger, but perhaps I shouldn't have; I eventually have to write
the bibimbap off as an educational but unsatisfying failure and
order a beef kebab myself.</p>

<p>My wrestle with lunch makes me late for my 1:30 appointment, but
this is OK as my difficulties have been telegraphed ahead by the
show organizers. Everyone in Korea wears a cellphone, and
(uninhibited by the American recipient-pays system) they use them
far more casually than Americans do. The girl at the food court
lunch counter was using hers as an intercom to phone orders to
booths fifteen feet away.</p>

<p>My 1:30 is a Professor Kim from one of South Korea's major
technical universities. He wants to set up a Korean center for free
software and wants ideas on how best to go about it from Tim Ney of
the Free Software Foundation and myself. We encourage him to fund
local Linux and GNU users groups and I assure him I am willing to
come back to Korea to speak at his launch conference. Then I go off
to plow through more of my mail.</p>

<p>I have just discovered that telnet is unaccountably much faster
than POP3 on this link and, started reading my mail that way when
one of the show organizers tells me my limo has been waiting for
half an hour outside the lobby of my hotel, the Coex
Intercontinental, two blocks away. Limo? Aarggh! Having carefully
kept the organizers up-to-date on my whereabouts, I had been
expecting that my tour guide would find me &mdash; or, at last, that I'd
be directed to the proper rendezvous. No such luck. I head over to
the Coex in a tearing hurry, thinking that my guide will have
written me off and departed by the time I get there.</p>

<p>Matters are not really helped by the Korean fanboy who attaches
himself to me as I'm leaving the Expo floor. He is so anxious to be
helpful that brushing him off would seem like kicking a puppy, but
I am too preoccupied with salvaging this mess in my schedule to
properly play the role of Great Man in his script. Making an
effort, I thank him for his rather ineffectual guidance when we get
to the Coex. He fades into the distance mumbling gratefully, and I
am bemused by the thought that I have probably made his month. I
wish I could have paid him more genuine attention.</p>

<p>Ashley is indeed waiting in the hotel lobby, with my guide who
turns out to be a friend and co-worker from her stewardess days. My
guide's name is Kyung Wan Kang, and she seems unreasonably
impressed that I can pronounce it correctly. She is as attractive
as you'd expect of a flight attendant on a national-flag airline
unencumbered by EEOC regulations &mdash; not as poised and immediately
charming as Ashley, but perhaps even prettier and (as Ashley
comments later) "with a good heart". Ashley admonishes us to have a
good time and runs off to organize something else; we collect our
chauffeur and are off.</p>

<p>Our first stop is Bong Wan Sa, a Korean Buddhist temple that
turns out to be within walking distance of the Coex. Wan has never
been there herself, though she tells me she has been to Buddhist
temples near Pusan where her family lives. The wooden buildings
remind me of Todai-ji in Kyoto, but are rather more decorated; the
dominant influences seem to have been Chinese rococo rather than
Zen austerity. Still, there is a Zenlike restfulness here. Despite
being in the middle of Seoul the monks have done a pretty good job
of maintaining the natural setting; trees and green things grow in
profusion among the buildings, and the traffic noise seems muted
and far away.</p>

<p>The interior ceiling of the main building is a particularly
impressive work of art, with the intricate details of the woodwork
picked out in bright blue, green, red, and yellow. Wan tells me of
a folk belief that the bright colors ward off the demons of ill
fortune. The back wall of the main temple is lined with glass
cabinets in which sit thousands of tiny, identical images of a
seated Buddha. In lieu of a candle each one has a teensy yellow
nixie light protruding from its base, which despite its location
forward of the Buddha's crossed legs manages to look rather
phallic. Each image has a named and numbered tag; Wan explains that
wealthy people buy these images from the temple as a kind of
sponsorship and acquire merit thereby.</p>

<p>Wan tells me that Bong Wan Sa was the head temple of Korean
Buddhism in times past, but is now mainly a training center for
young monks. Despite this, I don't see any of them around. The
people in the temple buildings all seem to be middle-aged and older
women in Western clothes, sitting quietly on prayer cushions
telling Buddhist rosaries or reading from what are presumably
religious works. One of them invites Wan and myself to light
candles and make wishes at the main altar, where a great gold image
of the Amitabha Buddha is flanked by two lesser aspects.</p>

<p>I explain carefully through Wan that I am not exactly a Buddhist
but more of a Buddhist sympathizer. The lady is cheerfully
indifferent to fine points of theology and presses candles into our
hands. We make our wishes and a shiko each. As we leave the main
building Wan tells me that she wished good health for her parents,
who have arthritis in their hands. I tell her that I have wished
for freedom for all beings to work out their enlightenment in their
own way. This leads to my trying to explain exactly what I am doing
in Korea. This is a difficult effort; Wan is far from stupid, but
neither does she have the technical background in computers that
would make the open-source idea easy to explain. Nevertheless she
seems to catch the spirit of what open-source people are trying to
do, and to admire it.</p>

<p>We wander around the temple's outbuildings for about half an
hour after that, admiring the architecture and talking. Wan tells
me about her job, cabin crew on the Seoul-Amsterdam route; about
living with her sisters in Seoul because her parents "will not
permit me to live alone"; about teaching high-school English, which
she does when not on airplanes. I tell her a little about my life
and travels, and invite her to come with me to the reception that
will be held at the Coex that evening.</p>

<p>At about 3:30 we rejoin our chauffeur and head over to the
Kukkiwon, the world headquarters of Tae Kwon Do. During the
twenty-minute ride over, I try to teach Wan to pronounce her friend
Ashley's name correctly. The consonant cluster "shl" does not occur
in Korean or in Japanese, the language Wan majored in in college,
so her pronunciation tends to come out "Ashulee". Wan's efforts are
not tremendously successful but we are both quite entertained by
the process.</p>

<p>The TKD school I studied at for nine years is a Kukkiwon
affiliate; my first-degree Black Belt certificate is on file in
these buildings somewhere, not that I have any particular need to
find it. We discover a gymnasium/exhibition hall where an actual
training class is going on; forty or so of what look like
high-school or college students being harangued in a familiar style
by an instructor. The command words and many of the moves look
familiar. The kids are wearing black belts, but many of them move
more like senior kup students &mdash; not badly, but not quite with the
disciplined snap and focus I expect from a dan-rank either. I knew
the Dragon Gym was a high-quality, well-respected TKD school; now I
begin to think it was better than I knew.</p>

<p>When the class breaks up, Wan and I explore some more and find
the Kukkiwon's souvenir shop. I am not entirely surprised to find
that it is cheesy to the max. The merchandise runs heavily to tacky
commemmorative plaques, silly key rings, cute anime cartoons of
characters doing TKD moves, foam-rubber martial-arts weapons, and
similar crap. My wife Cathy had muttered something about wanting a
souvenir from Korea, but there is nothing here I can bring myself
to take home.</p>

<p>Wan, talking with the proprietors, learns that there is a TKD
museum on the site. We follow the directions, but find it shut up
(despite the sign, which claims it ought to be open). Alas. But as
we walk away from the door we're spotted by a muscular,
sharply-dressed young man in white gloves who turns out to be the
museum manager. He opens up the place for us. Wan explains in
Korean (with asides to me explaining the explanation) that I am a
visiting il dan from the U.S. who is speaking at a software
conference.</p>

<p>The manager makes impressed noises, but I note that his eyes are
tracking Wan rather than me. I decide that I would be astonished if
it were otherwise &mdash; Wan, happy and glowing slightly in the early
summer heat, exudes a sexy innocence that could make a bishop kick
a hole in a stained-glass window to get a better look. Part of her
charm is that she seems genuinely unaware of her effect on anyone
male and not dead below the neck. As I take my first turn around
the museum I keep an amused eye on her interaction with the
manager, who is attempting to chat her up in a style that has
probably changed very little since before the discovery of fire.
The fact that I can't parse Korean saves me from the distraction of
what they are saying and frees me to observe their body language.
They are a handsome couple, and unless my interactive senses have
deserted me, he is a good sort (Wan tells me later he is a 6th dan,
which is quite a high rank for a man of before middle age and not
something you attain without unusual character as well as
technique). She could do far worse.</p>

<p>The museum itself is an improvement on the cheesy souvenir shop,
but it is more a history of the Kukkiwon itself than of TKD. Much
of it is pictures of various dignitaries, or gifts presented to the
Kukkiwon by school branches and other martial-arts organizations.
The most interesting exhibit to me is a sepia-toned Koguryo-period
manuscript illustration showing two pudgy men doing recognizable
flying kicks. It is not precisely dated, but could be as much as
1500 years old.</p>

<p>Wan, meanwhile, seems either oblivious to the manager's
attentions or to be politely ignoring them; it's hard to tell
which. The poor guy is understandably frustrated, but hiding it
quite well. There is a moment when I see Wan writing something for
him on a piece of paper and think he may have scored her phone
number &mdash; but, alas for him, she is merely correcting his
English.</p>

<p>Soon we thank him and take our leave. I tease Wan gently about
having gained an admirer. She appears genuinely to believe that it
was really me he was impressed with; apparently even 1st dan is a
rank considered worthy of respect here, and part of the
back-and-forth was her filling him in on my background as an
international troublemaker. Then, from behind us, we hear the
manager calling out. He is inviting us back to to the museum to
watch a TKD video.</p>

<p>It proves fairly interesting, a sort of anthology of the most
impressive moments from national and Olympic-team demonstrations.
There are elaborate flying board breaks of all kinds; simulated
two-on-one mugging scenarios; demonstrations of TKD-based police
tactics like comealong holds; and much more. The manager plies us
with cold drinks, and Wan with good-natured gallantry. Wan remains
impervious and, apparently, oblivious. She will star in his
fantasies for weeks, I suspect.</p>

<p>After this we head back to my room at the hotel. There are 45
minutes to kill before the reception; Wan spends them polishing her
English by reading the beginning of a fantasy novel I have with me
(Thomas Harlan's "Oath of Empire"). The reception itself is much
like similar events I have endured in Japan and Venezuela &mdash;
mind-numbing speeches by boring dignitaries, formal toasts, and a
palpable sense of relief when they finally turn us loose on the
canapes. RMS is tapped to make a speech and does so, but there is
no translator working and it's clear that his standard rant is
going right over the audience's collective head.</p>

<p>For me, even Wan's and Joanne's and Ashley's decorative
presences can't do much to rescue the event. The previous night's
opening reception had been more interesting, if `interesting' is
the word for it; the organizers told me a whole five minutes before
showtime that I was to give out three awards on behalf of the
conference. One of them was to my friend Jordan Hubbard, front guy
of FreeBSD and fellow .45 semi fan; the other two to Korean Linux
people with names that it is fortunate I was not required to
remember. I spoke the required banalities and executed the expected
ritual motions. Jordan and I successfully kept straight faces. It
was a success, I suppose.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, back in the present, I bid Miss Wan adieu. She must
leave, as she is teaching the next morning, but she gives me her
email address. The reception breaks up shortly afterwards; mindful
that my talk is tomorrow, I decline an invitation to go clubbing
with the party-animal types among the speakers.</p>

<p>I spend most of the following morning catching up on my email,
which has piled up to hideous heights. I am working in the
Greenhouse, an email garden set up on the show floor by a new
organization greenhouse.com that aims to be a nonprofit incubator
for open-source software companies. Fortunately, it has working
Ethernet connections. Unfortunately, the Red Hat and Zion Systems
booths nearby are pumping out techno-disco at high volume, and at
times the Greenhouse becomes something painfully resembling a giant
resonating chamber. I represent to the organizers that next year's
show would be tremendously improved by banning all loudspeakers
from the show floor...</p>

<p>One of the people working the Greenhouse is a woman whose badge
says "Annie Wu". She is a systems analyst from Shanghai, and pretty
in a classically Chinese way I have read about but never seen
face-to-face before (I later learn there is a specific Mandarin
term for it which translates as "having good eyes", and describes a
particular variant of the epicanthic fold). I notice that she seems
to be fussing over me a bit, asking if I need help, offering me
cold drinks, etc. Eventually I figure out that she thinks I am
soliciting her active attention by smiling at her, when in fact I
am actually smiling at her simply because my eyes tend to track on
the nearest moving object when I'm leaning back mentally composing
a reply, and my hindbrain then notices that she is pretty while my
forebrain is processing something else. I explain the
misunderstanding and we have a good laugh about it. For the next
couple of days, when Annie and I catch one another's eye, one of is
likely to say "Can I help you?" following which we both collapse in
a fit of giggles.</p>

<p>My speech Friday morning goes pretty well. The success is
largely due to the fact that the conference has sprung for a pair
of simultaneous translators and the non-English speakers are able
to hear a near-real-time rendition of my ranting through earphones.
The translators are good; they even manage to put over some of my
jokes. Afterwards I attempt to apologize for the difficulties I
suspect my slangy, energetic and informal presentation style
creates for them. They must relish a challenge, because they tell
me they enjoy working with a good speaker.</p>

<p>The real event of Friday, though, was the formal Korean feast.
This was held in a 500-year-old palace in another green oasis in
the heart of Seoul. All the conference's speakers, and the
organizers, sat at a long low table and were confronted with a
large variety of peculiar substances bearing some sort of
relationship to food. It was quite challenging. And educational.
And I think pre-modern Koreans must have had chronic
protein-deficiency problems.</p>

Seoul</p>
<br />

<br />
<p class="centered"><img src="dinner2.jpg" alt="" /><br />The feast</p>
<br />

<p>An incident at the feast launches the other running joke I get
involved in, with Leslie Proctor of the FSF. We have been becoming
acquainted because she is helping the show organizers do
scheduling. Our relationship takes a new turn Friday evening when
Richard Stallman sees the two of us standing accidentally side by
side and asks "Are you two related?"</p>

<p>Leslie and look at each other, two minds with but a single
thought: "What drugs is <em>he</em> on?." A quarter-second later we
watch each other doing a double-take as the realization strikes us
both that Richard's question was not crazy. We <em>do</em> look
like relatives, come to think of it &mdash; and not distant ones,
either. We have similar skull and facial shapes, eye colors,
reddish-brown hair, and burn-then-peel skin tone; and the
combination is not an especially common one. We analyze the matter,
and discover that we have about the same ancestral genetic mix
combining Celts, Rhinelander Germans, and a dab of Amerind. We
decide that Richard's acuity should be rewarded and take to
addressing each other as "cousin".</p>

<p>Leslie is the center figure in the following picture. She works
with Tim Ney, who keeps the Free Software Foundation running. The
pretty girl leaning on Leslie is Gui Hee, one of the conference
organizers; about whom more later.</p>

<br />
<p class="centered"><img src="cousin.jpg" alt="Leslie" /></p>
<br />

<p>I spend most of Saturday with a couple of guys from a Korean
media outfit who had got wind of my interest in Buddhist temples,
and drove me south from Seoul to a city called Yeoju. There we
visited the 900-year-old Temple of the Coming Buddha. More tranquil
gardens, more lovely woodwork &mdash; and Buddhist preaching from
vending machines. Yes, at Yeoju you can drop an offering in a slot
and hear a canned Buddhist discourse (in Korean) on some edifying
topic.</p>

<p>The most interesting thing I saw at this temple was a collection
of brightly-painted ritual instruments hundreds of years old &mdash;
huge taiko-like drums, great brass horns, gongs, and (for some
reason) a large metal effigy of a fish.</p>

<p>Afterwards we stopped at a sculpture garden, containing a
fascinating collection of Buddhist devotional art. Most of it was
elaborate wooden sculpture by a single obsessed artist &mdash;
fantastically detailed wooden filigrees of the Amitabha Buddha, of
snarling tigers, of peculiar figures from Korean folk myth.</p>

<p>That night, a bunch of us ate bulgoki at a streetside restaurant
in Seoul. Bulgoki, for those of you so unfortunate as not to have
experienced it, is Korea's national dish &mdash; marinated beef, with
lettuce and scallions, that you cook right at your table.
Delicious, especially combined with the nutty/sweet taste of Korean
rice and searing-hot red-peppered kimchi. It's a very social kind
of eating, everyone clustered around the grill and actively
involved in preparing the food they eat.</p>

<p>But that was only the veriest beginnining of the evening. Next,
they piled all the speakers onto a bus and headed us out to a
famous mall for midnight shopping. This is a peculiarly Korean
custom, as far as I know &mdash; shopping until you almost literally
drop.</p>

<p>On the way there, we discover that our bus is equipped with a
karaoke box. There ensues what I later mentally tag the Great
Karaoke Massacre, as various of us proceed to do things that
approximate singing. Frank Sinatra's "My Way", the Eurythymics'
"Sweet Dreams" and Queen's "We Are The Champions" meet particularly
horrible fates. I do Procol Harum's "Whiter Shade of Pale"; it is
later alleged by witnesses that I sang pretty well, but I sure
didn't think so at the time. Ashley and Gui Hee sang Korean folk
tunes in lovely clear voices, sounding infinitely better than most
of the beer-lubricated men on the bus.</p>

<br />
<p class="centered"><img src="guihee1.jpg" alt="" /><br />Gui Hee during the
Great Karaoke Massacre</p>
<br />

<p>By American standards the mall itself is kind of downmarket,
poorly lit and crowded with a lot of rickety little stalls. But
there is an amazing variety of goods on sale cheap and volume is
brisk. I reflect that it's easy to sneer at consumer culture when
you're already as rich in things as an American, but this is still
the Third World &mdash; people really can buy themselves better lives
here, and they're energetically doing it. I like what I'm
seeing.</p>

<p>I get my third lesson in Asian body language here when Gui Hee
declares her intention to help me find a present for my wife. She
then physically glues herself to me, holding my arm possessively,
walking very close, hanging out in my intimacy zone, occasionally
leaning her head on my shoulder. This is confusing &mdash; the more so
because Gui Hee is a ripe and sexy woman. I'm having some hormonal
difficulty thinking the situation through. In the U.S. her behavior
would be a rather direct sexual invitation, but that seems an
extremely unlikely interpretation given the rest of what she is
doing &mdash; that is, plying me with questions about what my wife might
like.</p>

<p>Gui Hee helps me pick out a hanbok, a traditional costume worn
by married Korean women. It is a handsome shade of blue/purple with
floral decoration. I restrain myself. Later, I quiz Ashley about
the matter. She explains that in Korea, this body language is not
necessarily a come-on but may simply signal respect for an older
male. She looks a little troubled and mutters that she'll have to
talk with Gui Hee about this. I share her concern; neither of us
wants Gui Hee to wind up in trouble with a Westerner less
self-controlled and self-aware than I.</p>

<p>After the mall, the disco. Ashley, quite justifiably pleading
fatigue, bails out. Gui Hee takes us to a club in the university
section of town. There is much music and dancing. Gui Hee clearly
loves this part; her dance moves are sensual, wild, a touch angry,
and I learn a great deal about her by watching them. The crowd is
rather international; I flirt with a French exchange student in an
oh-so-Parisian striped top. The hardest partiers are a couple of
German hackers attached to the KDE project who had previously
played, er, <em>prominent</em> parts in the Great Karaoke
Massacre.</p>

<br />
<p class="centered"><img src="guihee2.jpg" alt="" /><br />Gui Hee at some
undetermined point in the evening</p>
<br />

<p>We dance literally until dawn, and stumble out into the morning
sunlight to flag down taxis and head back to the Intercontinental
for a few hours' sleep.</p>

<p>The four days have gone by with startling speed. Ashley and I,
perhaps to our surprise, discover that we have become friends when
she comes to my hotel room to straighten out some sort of
administrivia related to the conference. We have our conversation
about Gui Hee's body language and talk of many other topics as
well. Among other things, when I ask Ashley what the approved
ethnic slur is for Westerners in Korea she smiles and taps the side
of her nose.</p>

<p>It seems that in Korean slang Westerners are "big noses". I
reflect with amusement that Ashley's nose is largish for a
Korean's. But I do not get around to making this joke, because poor
Ashley conks out. The woman has been running herself ragged for
most of a week keeping the conference on track; she is so exhausted
that my bed proves an irresistible lure. She crawls under the
covers and falls sound asleep.</p>

<p>I sat there for two hours while Ashley slept, hacking quietly,
feeling protective and thinking that I have been deeply
complimented by Ashley's unconsidered intimacy with a man she has
only known for a handful of days. She is bright, beautiful,
hard-working, serious-minded, and kind; I decided that I like her a
lot. Had I not feared the gesture would be misinterpreted as a
sexual imposition, I would have kissed her lightly when I woke her
up for dinner.</p>

<p>That was a fitting coda for my last day there. In Ashley, Kyung
Wan and Gui Hee I have seen three faces of the kind of people the
country produces &mdash; and in as patriarchal a culture as Korea, the
strength of these women seems even more remarkable than it would in
the U.S. Even given that the circumstances under which I met them
selected strongly for the intelligent and outgoing, I'm
impressed.</p>

<br />

<p>Fast-forward fourteen months...</p>

<br />

<p>My first time in Korea was very good to me. So when Gui Hee
asked me to come back in September 2001 I didn't really
hesitate.</p>

<p>My second trip wasn't for a conference but for a speaking tour.
Three talks ("The Open Source Revolution", "Twenty Years Among The
Hackers", "Freedom, Power, and Software") in two cities (Seoul and
Pusan) to a total of about 1800 people. I guess they liked what
they heard; they lined up for autographs afterwards by the dozens
at all three places.</p>

<p>In fact, I have a new definition of `frustration' now &mdash; it's
getting the melty wide-eyed hero-worshipping look from gorgeous
twentysomething Korean college girls and knowing there is just no
way I can ethically give them what their sexual-selective instincts
are clamoring for. Two of them pressed pictures of themselves on
me. Arrrggh! There I was, caught squarely between my male-primate
hindbrain and the certain knowledge that chatting up any of those
sweet young things would be a Really Bad Idea on many levels...
:-)</p>

<p>The talks weren't the best part, though. The best part was
hanging out with old friends and new. Old friends Gui Hee and
Ashley, the organizers of Global Linux 2000 last year &mdash; two smart
and energetic women not a bit less good-looking than those college
girls. And new friends; Gui-Hee's boss Rodney (COO of Turbo Linux
Systems, the company that sponsored my trip) and an expert on
scientific cluster computing named Rok (the name is Slovene).</p>

<p>Friday evening was especially memorable, sitting with Rok and
Ashley and Gui Hee and a couple others in a traditional Korean
teahouse in In Sa Dong (Seoul's old quarter) talking of many
things, sipping exotic teas. Walking arm-in-arm with Ashley and Gui
Hee later on, singing songs: more Korean folk tunes from Gui Hee
and Ashley, Pete Seeger's "Blue and Gray" from me (I then had to
explain the American Civil War). Wandering past the floodlit main
gate of the old Royal Palace, then through a night-shadowed
Buddhist temple; bowing respect to the stone pagoda there, and
watching Gui Hee pray for a few moments while Ashley and I hugged
companionably against the chill.</p>

<p>A few minutes after that we got a reminder of the rest of the
world; we walked by a building that was guarded by a full platoon
of Korean military police in helmets and M-16s. Turned out to be
the U.S. Embassy.</p>

<p>My companions are very lively company. Gui Hee teases Ashley and
me a lot; actually she teases <em>everyone</em> a lot. She's
intense, sexually challenging, somewhat hot-tempered, and likes to
play being a bit of a bad girl &mdash; but she's really rather sweet
underneath. She has kind of a younger-sister relationship with
Ashley, who is a bit steadier and more cerebral. Ashley is very
poised, very capable, a good organizer. They do marketing for two
different technology companies in Seoul and have been best friends
for years.</p>

<p>Weirdly, Gui Hee reports that they're both between boyfriends
and having trouble finding new ones. They're pushing thirty, which
is about the age Korean women are expected to be married, and no
husband material is in sight. This causes me to think unflattering
things about Korean men, who must be pretty damn lacking in taste
not to be camping on both of these girls' doorsteps by the
dozens.</p>

<p>Ashley seems a little blue, and I think I know why &mdash; she has
mentioned that she is going to a friend's wedding party Saturday.
So I flirt with her and am extra gallant and behave rather as if
we're on a date, which does seem to buck her up; she flirts back a
little, holds my hand, and seems to welcome an arm around her. Gui
Hee, bless her kindhearted and devious little soul, spends half her
time theatrically pretending to be scandalized by our behavior and
half of it threatening to bail out and leave us alone together.
Ashley and I tease her right back, announcing at one point that
we've decided to run off to Rio de Janeiro together after robbing a
bank.</p>

<p>Percolating somewhere in the back of Gui Hee's brain, I suspect,
is the thought that it would be good for Ashley to get well and
thoroughly laid. If so, then I think she is quite likely right and
am willing to hold up my end of the proceedings. But matters do not
go beyond warm hugs &mdash; which is OK; that seems to be what our
friend Ashley needs. At one point when Ashley isn't around I
suggest to Gui Hee that she ought to make a point of taking her
friend out to have some fun and meet some men sometime soon. This
message appears to be received and understood.</p>

<p>Next day, while Ashley is at the wedding party, Gui Hee and I go
to the Demilitarized Zone &mdash; the buffer between South and North
Korea, and the last frontier of the Cold War. It is less than an
hour's drive north of Seoul.</p>

<p>For a few miles south of the DMZ there is almost no human
habitation except South Korean military installations &mdash; and a few
villages where the people live under martial-law-like regulations.
The two countries never signed a peace treaty, only an armed truce,
and the fear of North Korean infiltrators is real. Nor is it
exaggerrated; a South Korean prime minister was assassinated by
them in the not-too-distant past.</p>

<p>Gui Hee's boss Rodney is a former U.S. military intelligence
analyst who specialized in North Korea; I regret we don't have him
with us. Nevertheless looking across the DMZ is a surreal and
sobering experience for anyone who has read the news leaking out of
North Korea. At the observation point we visit, an
immaculately-uniformed briefing officer tells us the only city
visible from the South has been turned into a giant propaganda
stage set &mdash; they know this because there is no washing on the
clothelines and the house lights all turn on and off at the same
time.</p>

<p>Behind that stage set, North Korea is a grim joke &mdash;
famine-ridden but vicious, an Orwellian nightmare come true. Kim Il
Sung's revolutionary vanguard took two-thirds of Korea's pre-1945
industry and central-planned most of it into rusting heaps of junk,
and collective-farmed their agriculture into oblivion. Now the
people are starving by millions while the government chants
Leninist slogans about the inevitable victory of scientific
socialism. Rodney told me that the whole country is militarized but
ammunition is so short that soldiers only rarely fire live bullets
in training. They wall out the world, except for sending out
terrorists and assassins on missions that usually fail and gain
their country nothing strategic when they succeed. The place is a
crumbling asylum run by murderous lunatics.</p>

<p>If Communism had won, the whole planet would be like that. Ideas
really do have consequences; I stare at the deserted grasslands
across the DMZ and wish I could somehow swap out the suffering
victims of the North Korean regime for the Westerners Lenin called
"useful idiots" &mdash; the parlor Bolsheviks, the peace-at-any-price
patsies, the vapid academic Marxists, and all the "moral
equivalence"-spouting moral cretins I ever heard tell the world
that we didn't deserve to win the Cold War. Let <em>them</em>
"build socialism" together and starve. They'd be no loss, no loss
at all.</p>

<p>The best is yet to come. In 1995 the South Koreans detected an
infiltration tunnel running south 400 meters under the DMZ. They
sank a shaft to intercept it, seized it, blocked the north end with
a concrete plug &mdash; and opened the place to tourists. You can walk
down the steep adit they dug and into the tunnel, 150 meters deep.
It's cut through live granite. The roof is barely high enough for
me at 5'7" and I have to duck my head frequently. The walls and
ceiling are jagged rock, dripping moisture.</p>

<p>I think of orcs, but fantasy pales here; the whips driving the
slaves who carved <em>this</em> tunnel were wielded by an evil more
fell than Tolkien ever imagined. It can only be my imagination that
I seem to feel it in the slime on the stones, and to hear echoes of
pain and terror suffered under the lash in the trickling of the
waters. That's what I tell myself, anyway. Then I come to the
barrier.</p>

<p>Coils of barbed wire keep us yards away from the actual concrete
plug, obviously meant to forestall any useful idiot who got the
bright idea of blowing it open from the south side. The hanggul and
English "RESTRICTED" signs are close enough to runes of power.
North Korea is scant yards away on the other side. The Cold War is
not yet quite over.</p>

<p>Gui Hee and I contemplate it in silence for a few moments, then
turn and leave. As I had expected, the way out is harder than the
way down; it's a long trudge back up the adit, and we are grateful
for the first glimmer of surface light. Blinking, we emerge into
the sunshine.</p>
