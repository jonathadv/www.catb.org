<p>Since making presentations like this one is a significant
application area for many non-technical users, there are some
useful lessons in our experience putting this production
together.</p>

<p>No proprietary software was used in the making of this
production. No animals were harmed, either, although we did
brainstorm it over a couple of damn good steak dinners.</p>

<p>We used <a href="http://www.xsane.org/">xsane 0.77</a> with an
Epson Perfection 1650 scanner for photograph capture. This
combination worked extremely well. Kudos to the authors of xsane
for excellent work; the only two nits we found were that it really
ought to default to color mode, and needs to handle out-of-memory
errors induced by very large image dumps more gracefully.</p>

<p>We heartily recommend the <a
href="http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/ProductQuickSpec.jsp?BV_SessionID=@@@@0701153446.1012160183@@@@&amp;BV_EngineID=eadcddlmdlmibfdmcfjgckidnf.0&amp;oid=6464130&amp;category=Products">
Perfection 1650</a> to anyone looking for a quality scanner at a
good price. Epson has cooperated well with the open-source
community, and the results do all parties proud.</p>

<p>Before we settled on the Epson, we had a
very...educational...experience with a $40 scanner that shall
remain nameless. It claimed to be a USB scanner, but lied -- it
required a proprietary firmware upload at initialization time and
would not work with Linux's USB scanner driver. Yes, we encountered
a WinScanner! Stay out of the price basement; it's more trouble
than it's worth.</p>

<p>We did image conversion, cropping and resizing using the
ImageMagick convert(1) and display(1) tools. The xwd(1) utility was
used to capture screen displays. All these programs worked well and
without fuss.</p>

<p>The presentation was sequenced with Kpresenter (from koffice
1.1), which is marginally usable but in no way ready for the
non-techie. The UI is cluttered, inconsistent, confusing, and at
times capricious. We tripped over many bugs and instabilities, and
hung it at least a dozen times during simple, basic operations like
resizing text. It is also very poorly documented, and uses an
opaque binary file format.</p>

<p>(I have since been told that the "opaque binary file format" is
actually a tar archive of XML files and PNG images. That's still
opaque, since as far as I know this fact is not documented, and
it's still binary.)</p>

<p>Kpresenter's most serious flaw was functional -- no way to
associate sound clips with the slides. As a result, we experimented
with using a browser in full-screen mode as a presentation engine,
only to discover that embedding sound in in local web pages is
unusably flaky. We couldn't get it to work in either Mozilla or
Konqueror, and for the same reason. Both paint the web page twice,
and spawn two sound helpers that fight with each other.</p>

<p>As a result, we ended up planning to drive the presentation
visuals and sound from two different computers, with manual
sequencing. This <em>must</em> be fixed if kpresenter is going to
be competitive -- because the night before going to LWE, I found
MagicPoint.</p>

<p>MagicPoint is a rather more powerful and simpler presentation
package than kpresenter. It can attach sound clips to slides and do
all manner of other interesting things that kpresenter cannot,
including allowing you to scribble on a slide while it is being
displayed.</p>

<p>MagicPoint has only one drawback: no GUI. You write your slides
in a simple markup language, bashing tags with a text editor. This
is great for geeks but a deadly turnoff to end-users. Someone could
do the world a great service by writing a GUI editor for MagicPoint
files.</p>

<p>About those sound clips...we found a clean MP3 of the entire
Dragnet theme on the Web. When it became apparent that we would
need to drop out the middle section with the voiceover, I went
looking for an MP3 audio editor. We found one: <a
href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a>. I love this
piece of software -- it's beautifully designed, has a clean and
readily accessible UI, and is excellently documented to boot. Using
it helped banish the bad taste kpresenter had left in our
mouths.</p>

<p>We tripped over a couple of dozen embarrassing bugs in a few
days' work. We have no doubt that all could easily be fixed. Our
experience suggests that the problem with open-source applications
is not poor design or implementation, it's inadequate testing. The
usage patterns of developers don't match those of end-users, so
they sail right by the bugs that actual users would trip right over
and be immediately turned off by.</p>

<p>It's a self-reinforcing problem -- untested software drives away
real users, so it never gets properly tested, so it never gets good
enough not to drive away users. Somehow we need to set up more
tests with ordinary users.</p>

<p>The software we had to learn to use during production refutes
the canard that Linux hackers as a group are hopelessly bad at
interface design for non-techies. Rather, open source completely
spans the gamut -- from clumsy, overcomplex and brittle UIs like
that of kpresenter, through excellent if somwhat complex interfaces
like that of xsane, all the way to superbly simple UIs like that of
audacity.</p>

<p>Audacity has a UI as good or better than the average Macintosh
application. That's where we need to be for Linux on the desktop to
stop being a subject for vaudeville routines, and start being an
unstoppable tide.</p>
