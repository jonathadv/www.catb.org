<p><em>Special to TechNewsNet, July 2005</em> -- Millions of Microsoft users
woke up to a new and deadlier Blue Screen of Death this morning.  It
said "This is the Final Virus.  For spam to end, Windows must die!".
Rebooting got them nowhere, because their hard drives had been
formatted. All their data was destroyed.</p>

<p>A bulletin from CERT, the Computer Emergency Readiness Team
chartered by the U.S. government, advised all Windows users to take
their machines off the Internet immediately.  "Final is <a
href='http://www.cknow.com/vtutor/vtpolymorphic.htm'>polymorphic</a>,
so normal virus scanners don't spot it.  Final spreads via infected
Web pages, UPnP, the Microsoft Upgrade Channel, the Microsoft
Messenger service, and possibly other routes," says the
bulletin. Final seems to be written to do IP port scans and infect a
fixed number of other machines before destroying its host.  Infection
reports have been rising exponentially since Final was first reported
four days ago.</p>

<p>In a possibly related development, ISPs reported that the volume of
spam detected at their servers has dropped between 2% and 10% since
Final first appeared -- the first such drop in memory.  Most spam is
sent by zombie networks of cracked Windows machines; as more succumb
to the virus or are pulled off-net, spam volume is expected to drop
further.</p>

<p>But at least one company isn't taking Final's death notice at face
value.  A Microsoft spokesman hinted that the open-source community
might be behind the attack.  "You've got to ask yourself: who
benefits?"  said Craig Mundie.  "And then you have to look at Linux."
Microsoft's IE web browser has been losing market share to open-source
Firefox since CERT's bulletin on the <a
href='http://networks.org/?src=cert:713878'>BHO</a> vulnerability
early last year.  Linux's market share in new server installations
passed Microsoft's in 1Q2005, continuing a trend begun in 1Q2004 when
Linux posted 57% gains to a full quarter of Microsoft's share.  Two
quarters of disappointing earnings reports this year have the company
under pressure from analysts.</p>

<p>But "I don't think this is us," said Eric Raymond, president of the
Open Source Initiative. "Why would any of us perform a criminal attack
on Microsoft's users when we're winning them over fair and square?
Actually, this is very bad news for us; it might get INDUCE II
passed."</p>

<p>Yesterday Senator Orrin Hatch issued a statement that Final
highlights the need to make so-called "Digital Rights Management"
hardware mandatory on all new computers.  INDUCE II is backed by
Microsoft, the Motion Picture Industry of America, and other
anti-open-source groups; it would require software to have a
cryptographic signature issued by a Federal security-certification
authority before it could run on new hardware, and make circumvention 
of a computer's onboard DRM a felony offense.</p>

<p>Washington insiders are saying that in the wake of the damage wrought
by Final, INDUCE II could be reported out of committee as early as next
week.</p>

<p>The frightening thing about this story is how very little of it is
fiction.</p>

<p>According to the ISPs who monitor these things, more than 80% of
all Internet traffic is now spam, with the percentage still rising.
And gone are the halcyon days when that spam was mostly porn-site
solicitations and pyramid schemes; nowadays, most of it is either
attempts to propagate viruses or bounce messages from failed attempts.
Those viruses, in turn, are nowadays primarily designed to crack
Windows machines and turn them into spam-sending zombies.  Email users
are in imminent danger of drowning in a flood of garbage; the spam and
virus problems have become inextricably intertwined.</p>

<p>And, in fact, the underlying technical problem is the incurable
insecurity of Microsoft Windows.  Crackers and spammer gangs are now
finding exploits faster than Microsoft can patch them; the help-object
hole in IE, which can silently zombify any machine that visits an
infected webpage, is only the most notorious of the recent
vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>Final would be an extremely simple virus to write.  We haven't seen
it yet, because up to now virus writers have wanted to capture and
exploit Windows machines, not exterminate them.  But all it would take
is one programmer.  The virus-writing toolkits to produce such a beast
are <a href='http://www.hnc3k.com/viruscreationprogramz.htm'>already
out there</a>.</p>

<p>Though Linux passed Microsoft in web-server market share long ago,
it remains second in overall share for intranet and general-purpose
servers. But unless there is some break in the trend curves Linux
really will be #1 around the beginning of 2005.  Microsoft is already
bracing for it; in a recent memo. Steve Ballmer announced a <a
href="http://www.technewsworld.com/story/34985.html">billion-dollar
cut</a> in employee benefits and other expenses.</p>

<p>INDUCE II doesn't exist, but INDUCE I already does and Orrin Hatch is its 
sponsor.  Similar proposals have been floated before.  Intel is already
shipping NX hardware that requires a cryptographic signature before 
binaries will run.</p>

<p>I don't know how to keep this future from happening.  The inertia
of that huge mass of Windows users out there makes it very unlikely
that we can convert everyone voluntarily before some fed-up,
spam-victimized programmer decides to force the issue.</p>

<p>We'd better hope we find a way, though.  If this is how Windows 
dies, it could very well take us down with it.</p>
