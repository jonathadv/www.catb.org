Just as importantly, I inherited
popclient's user base.  Users are wonderful things to have, and
not just because they demonstrate that you're serving a need, that 
you've done something right.  Properly cultivated, they can 
become co-developers.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another strength of the Unix tradition, one that Linux pushes to
a happy extreme, is that a lot of users are hackers too.  Because
source code is available, they can be <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">effective</i></span>
hackers.  This can be tremendously useful for shortening debugging
time.  Given a bit of encouragement, your users will diagnose
problems, suggest fixes, and help improve the code far more quickly
than you could unaided.</p><blockquote xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="blockquote"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">6. Treating your users as co-developers is your
       least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective
       debugging.</p></blockquote><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The power of this effect is easy to underestimate.  In fact, pretty
well all of us in the open-source world drastically underestimated
how well it would scale up with number of users and against system
complexity, until Linus Torvalds showed us differently.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In fact, I think Linus's cleverest and most consequential hack
was not the construction of the Linux kernel itself, but rather his
invention of the Linux development model.  When I expressed this
opinion in his presence once, he smiled and quietly repeated something
he has often said: ``I'm basically a very lazy person who likes to get
credit for things other people actually do.''  Lazy like a fox.  Or,
as Robert Heinlein famously wrote of one of his characters, too lazy
to fail.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In retrospect, one precedent for the methods and success of
Linux can be seen in the development of the GNU Emacs Lisp library and
Lisp code archives.  In contrast to the cathedral-building style of
the Emacs C core and most other GNU tools, the evolution of the Lisp
code pool was fluid and very user-driven.  Ideas and prototype modes
were often rewritten three or four times before reaching a stable
final form.  And loosely-coupled collaborations enabled by the
Internet, <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">a la</i> Linux, were
frequent.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Indeed, my own most successful single hack previous to fetchmail
was probably Emacs VC (version control) mode, a Linux-like
collaboration by email with three other people, only one of whom
(Richard Stallman, the author of Emacs and founder of the <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://www.fsf.org" target="_top">Free Software Foundation</a>) I have met
to this day.  It was a front-end for SCCS, RCS and later CVS from
within Emacs that offered ``one-touch'' version control operations.
It evolved from a tiny, crude sccs.el mode somebody else had written.
And the development of VC succeeded because, unlike Emacs itself,
Emacs Lisp code could go through release/test/improve generations very
quickly.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Emacs story is not unique.  There have been other software
products with a two-level architecture and a two-tier user community
that combined a cathedral-mode core and a bazaar-mode toolbox.  One
such is MATLAB, a commercial data-analysis and visualization tool. 
Users of MATLAB and other products with a similar structure invariably
report that the action, the ferment, the innovation mostly takes place
in the open part of the tool where a large and varied community can
tinker with it.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s02.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s04.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">The Mail Must Get Through </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">  Release Early, Release Often</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
