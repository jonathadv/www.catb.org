questions about the preconditions for successful bazaar-style
development, including both the qualifications of the project leader
and the state of code at the time one goes public and starts to try to
build a co-developer community.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It's fairly clear that one cannot code from the ground up in
bazaar style <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="ar01s14.html#IN">[IN]</a>.  One can test, debug
and improve in bazaar style, but it would be very hard to
<span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">originate</i></span> a project in bazaar mode.  Linus didn't
try it.  I didn't either.  Your nascent developer community needs to
have something runnable and testable to play with.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When you start community-building, what you need to be able to
present is a <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">plausible promise</i></span>.  Your program
doesn't have to work particularly well.  It can be crude, buggy,
incomplete, and poorly documented.  What it must not fail to do is (a)
run, and (b) convince potential co-developers that it can be evolved
into something really neat in the foreseeable future.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Linux and fetchmail both went public with strong, attractive basic
designs.  Many people thinking about the bazaar model as I have
presented it have correctly considered this critical, then jumped from
that to the conclusion that a high degree of design intuition and
cleverness in the project leader is indispensable.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">But Linus got his design from Unix.  I got mine initially from
the ancestral popclient (though it would later change a great deal,
much more proportionately speaking than has Linux).  So does the
leader/coordinator for a bazaar-style effort really have to have
exceptional design talent, or can he get by through leveraging the
design talent of others?</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I think it is not critical that the coordinator be able to
originate designs of exceptional brilliance, but it is absolutely
critical that the coordinator be able to <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">recognize good
design ideas from others</i></span>.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both the Linux and fetchmail projects show evidence of this.  Linus,
while not (as previously discussed) a spectacularly original designer,
has displayed a powerful knack for recognizing good design and
integrating it into the Linux kernel.  And I have already described
how the single most powerful design idea in fetchmail (SMTP
forwarding) came from somebody else.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Early audiences of this essay complimented me by suggesting that I am
prone to undervalue design originality in bazaar projects because I
have a lot of it myself, and therefore take it for granted.  There may
be some truth to this; design (as opposed to coding or debugging) is
certainly my strongest skill.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">But the problem with being clever and original in software design is
that it gets to be a habit&#8212;you start reflexively making things cute
and complicated when you should be keeping them robust and simple.  I
have had projects crash on me because I made this mistake, but I
managed to avoid this with fetchmail.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">So I believe the fetchmail project succeeded partly because I
restrained my tendency to be clever; this argues (at least) against
design originality being essential for successful bazaar projects.
And consider Linux.  Suppose Linus Torvalds had been trying to pull
off fundamental innovations in operating system design during the
development; does it seem at all likely that the resulting kernel
would be as stable and successful as what we have?</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A certain base level of design and coding skill is required, of
course, but I expect almost anybody seriously thinking of launching a
bazaar effort will already be above that minimum.  The open-source
community's internal market in reputation exerts subtle pressure on
people not to launch development efforts they're not competent to
follow through on.  So far this seems to have worked pretty
well.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is another kind of skill not normally associated with
software development which I think is as important as design
cleverness to bazaar projects&#8212;and it may be more important.  A
bazaar project coordinator or leader must have good people and
communications skills.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This should be obvious.  In order to build a development
community, you need to attract people, interest them in what you're
doing, and keep them happy about the amount of work they're doing.
Technical sizzle will go a long way towards accomplishing this, but
it's far from the whole story.  The personality you project matters,
too.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is not a coincidence that Linus is a nice guy who makes
people like him and want to help him.  It's not a coincidence that I'm
an energetic extrovert who enjoys working a crowd and has some of the
delivery and instincts of a stand-up comic.  To make the bazaar model
work, it helps enormously if you have at least a little skill at
charming people.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s09.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s11.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">A Few More Lessons from Fetchmail </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">  The Social Context of Open-Source Software</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
