the author's everyday problems, and spread because the problem turns
out to be typical for a large class of users.  This takes us back to
the matter of rule 1, restated in a perhaps more useful way:</p><blockquote xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="blockquote"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">18. To solve an interesting problem, start by
        finding a problem that is interesting to you.</p></blockquote><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">So it was with Carl Harris and the ancestral popclient, and so with me
and fetchmail.  But this has been understood for a long time.  The
interesting point, the point that the histories of Linux and fetchmail
seem to demand we focus on, is the next stage&#8212;the evolution of
software in the presence of a large and active community of users and
co-developers.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Mythical Man-Month</i>, Fred Brooks
observed that programmer time is not fungible; adding developers to a
late software project makes it later.  As we've seen previously, he
argued that the complexity and communication costs of a project rise
with the square of the number of developers, while work done only
rises linearly.  Brooks's Law has been widely regarded as a truism.  But
we've examined in this essay an number of ways in which the process of
open-source development falsifies the assumptionms behind it&#8212;and,
empirically, if Brooks's Law were the whole picture Linux would be
impossible.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gerald Weinberg's classic <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Psychology of Computer
Programming</i> supplied what, in hindsight, we can see as a
vital correction to Brooks.  In his discussion of ``egoless
programming'', Weinberg observed that in shops where developers are
not territorial about their code, and encourage other people to look
for bugs and potential improvements in it, improvement happens
dramatically faster than elsewhere. (Recently, Kent Beck's `extreme
programming' technique of deploying coders in pairs looking over one
anothers' shoulders might be seen as an attempt to force this
effect.)</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Weinberg's choice of terminology has perhaps prevented his
analysis from gaining the acceptance it deserved&#8212;one has to smile
at the thought of describing Internet hackers as ``egoless''.  But I
think his argument looks more compelling today than ever.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The bazaar method, by harnessing the full power of the ``egoless
programming'' effect, strongly mitigates the effect of Brooks's Law.
The principle behind Brooks's Law is not repealed, but given a large
developer population and cheap communications its effects can be
swamped by competing nonlinearities that are not otherwise visible.
This resembles the relationship between Newtonian and Einsteinian
physics&#8212;the older system is still valid at low energies, but if you
push mass and velocity high enough you get surprises like nuclear
explosions or Linux.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The history of Unix should have prepared us for what we're
learning from Linux (and what I've verified experimentally on a
smaller scale by deliberately copying Linus's methods <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="ar01s14.html#EGCS">[EGCS]</a>).  That is, while coding remains an
essentially solitary activity, the really great hacks come from
harnessing the attention and brainpower of entire communities.  The
developer who uses only his or her own brain in a closed project is
going to fall behind the developer who knows how to create an open,
evolutionary context in which feedback exploring the design space,
code contributions, bug-spotting, and other improvements come from
from hundreds (perhaps thousands) of people.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">But the traditional Unix world was prevented from pushing this
approach to the ultimate by several factors.  One was the legal
contraints of various licenses, trade secrets, and commercial
interests.  Another (in hindsight) was that the Internet wasn't
yet good enough.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Before cheap Internet, there were some geographically compact
communities where the culture encouraged Weinberg's ``egoless''
programming, and a developer could easily attract a lot of skilled
kibitzers and co-developers.  Bell Labs, the MIT AI and LCS labs, UC
Berkeley&#8212;these became the home of innovations that are legendary
and still potent.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Linux was the first project for which a conscious and successful
effort to use the entire <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">world</i></span> as its talent
pool was made.  I don't think it's a coincidence that the gestation period of
Linux coincided with the birth of the World Wide Web, and that Linux
left its infancy during the same period in 1993&#8211;1994 that saw the
takeoff of the ISP industry and the explosion of mainstream interest
in the Internet.  Linus was the first person who learned how to play
by the new rules that pervasive Internet access made possible.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While cheap Internet was a necessary condition for the Linux model to
evolve, I think it was not by itself a sufficient condition. Another
vital factor was the development of a leadership style and set of
cooperative customs that could allow developers to attract
co-developers and get maximum leverage out of the medium.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">But what is this leadership style and what are these customs?
They cannot be based on power relationships&#8212;and even if they could
be, leadership by coercion would not produce the results we see.
Weinberg quotes the autobiography of the 19th-century Russian
anarchist Pyotr Alexeyvich Kropotkin's <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Memoirs of a
Revolutionist</i> to good effect on this subject:</p><blockquote xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="blockquote"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Having been brought up in a serf-owner's family, I entered active
life, like all young men of my time, with a great deal of confidence
in the necessity of commanding, ordering, scolding, punishing and the
like. But when, at an early stage, I had to manage serious enterprises
and to deal with [free] men, and when each mistake would lead at once to
heavy consequences, I began to appreciate the difference between
acting on the principle of command and discipline and acting on the
principle of common understanding. The former works admirably in a
military parade, but it is worth nothing where real life is concerned,
and the aim can be achieved only through the severe effort of many
converging wills.</p></blockquote><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ``severe effort of many converging wills'' is precisely what a
project like Linux requires&#8212;and the ``principle of command'' is
effectively impossible to apply among volunteers in the anarchist's
paradise we call the Internet. To operate and compete effectively,
hackers who want to lead collaborative projects have to learn how to
recruit and energize effective communities of interest in the mode
vaguely suggested by Kropotkin's ``principle of understanding''.  They
must learn to use Linus's Law.<a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="ar01s14.html#SP">[SP]</a></p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Earlier I referred to the ``Delphi effect'' as a possible explanation
for Linus's Law.  But more powerful analogies to adaptive systems in
biology and economics also irresistably suggest themselves.  The Linux
world behaves in many respects like a free market or an ecology, a
collection of selfish agents attempting to maximize utility which in
the process produces a self-correcting spontaneous order more
elaborate and efficient than any amount of central planning could have
achieved.  Here, then, is the place to seek the ``principle of
understanding''.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ``utility function'' Linux hackers are maximizing is not
classically economic, but is the intangible of their own ego
satisfaction and reputation among other hackers.  (One may call their
motivation ``altruistic'', but this ignores the fact that altruism is
itself a form of ego satisfaction for the altruist).  Voluntary
cultures that work this way are not actually uncommon; one other in
which I have long participated is science fiction fandom, which unlike
hackerdom has long explicitly recognized ``egoboo'' (ego-boosting, or
the enhancement of one's reputation among other fans) as the basic
drive behind volunteer activity.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Linus, by successfully positioning himself as the gatekeeper of a
project in which the development is mostly done by others, and
nurturing interest in the project until it became self-sustaining, has
shown an acute grasp of Kropotkin's ``principle of shared
understanding''.  This quasi-economic view of the Linux world enables
us to see how that understanding is applied.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We may view Linus's method as a way to create an efficient market in
``egoboo''&#8212;to connect the selfishness of individual hackers as firmly
as possible to difficult ends that can only be achieved by sustained
cooperation.  With the fetchmail project I have shown (albeit on a
smaller scale) that his methods can be duplicated with good results.
Perhaps I have even done it a bit more consciously and systematically
than he.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many people (especially those who politically distrust free
markets) would expect a culture of self-directed egoists to be
fragmented, territorial, wasteful, secretive, and hostile.  But this
expectation is clearly falsified by (to give just one example) the
stunning variety, quality, and depth of Linux documentation.  It is a
hallowed given that programmers <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">hate</i></span> documenting;
how is it, then, that Linux hackers generate so much documentation?
Evidently Linux's free market in egoboo works better to produce
virtuous, other-directed behavior than the massively-funded
documentation shops of commercial software producers.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both the fetchmail and Linux kernel projects show that by properly
rewarding the egos of many other hackers, a strong
developer/coordinator can use the Internet to capture the benefits of
having lots of co-developers without having a project collapse into a
chaotic mess.  So to Brooks's Law I counter-propose the
following:</p><blockquote xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="blockquote"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">19: Provided the development coordinator has a
    communications medium at least as good as the Internet, and knows
    how to lead without coercion, many heads are inevitably better
    than one.</p></blockquote><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I think the future of open-source software will increasingly
belong to people who know how to play Linus's game, people who leave
behind the cathedral and embrace the bazaar.  This is not to say that
individual vision and brilliance will no longer matter; rather, I
think that the cutting edge of open-source software will belong to
people who start from individual vision and brilliance, then amplify
it through the effective construction of voluntary communities of
interest.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Perhaps this is not only the future of
<span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">open-source</i></span> software.  No closed-source developer
can match the pool of talent the Linux community can bring to bear on
a problem.  Very few could afford even to hire the more than 200
(1999: 600, 2000: 800) people who have contributed to
fetchmail!</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Perhaps in the end the open-source culture will triumph not because
cooperation is morally right or software ``hoarding'' is morally wrong
(assuming you believe the latter, which neither Linus nor I do), but
simply because the closed-source world cannot win an evolutionary arms
race with open-source communities that can put orders of magnitude
more skilled time into a problem.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s10.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s12.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top"> Necessary Preconditions for the Bazaar Style </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> On Management and the Maginot Line</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
