and rapidly collected an informal network of allies over the Internet
(including key people at Netscape and O'Reilly Associates). Where I
write `we' below I'm referring to that network.</p><p>From 3 February to around the time of the actual Netscape release on
31 March, our primary concern was convincing the hacker community that
the `open source' label and the arguments that went with it
represented our best shot at persuading the mainstream.  As it turned
out, the change was rather easier than we expected.  We discovered a
lot of pent-up demand for a message less doctrinaire than the Free
Software Foundation's.</p><p>Tim O'Reilly invited twenty-odd leaders of major free software
projects to what came to be called the Free Software Summit on 7
March.  When these leaders voted to adopt the term `open source', they
formally ratified a trend that was already clear at the grass roots
among developers.  By six weeks after the Mountain View meeting, a
healthy majority of the community was speaking our language.</p><p>The publicity following the Free Software Summit introduced the
mainstream press to the term, and also gave notice that Netscape was
not alone in adopting the open-source concept.  We'd given a name to a
phenomenon whose impact was already larger than anyone outside the
Internet community had yet realized.  Far from being fringe
challengers, open source programs were already market leaders in
providing key elements of the Internet infrastructure.  Apache was the
leading web server, with more than 50% market share (now grown to more
than 60%.)  Perl was the dominant programming language for the new
breed of web-based applications.  Sendmail routes more than 80% of all
Internet email messages.  And even the ubiquitous domain name system
(which lets us use names like www.yahoo.com rather than obscure
numeric IP addresses) depends almost entirely on an open-source
program called BIND.  As Tim O'Reilly said during the press conference
following the summit, pointing to the assembled programmers and
project leaders: ``These people have created products with dominant
market share using only the power of their ideas and the networked
community of their co-developers.''  What more might be possible if
large companies also adopted the open source methodology?</p><p>That was a good start to our `air war', our attempt to change
perceptions through the press.  But we still needed to maintain
momentum on the ground.  In April, after the Summit and the actual
Netscape release, our main concern shifted to recruiting as many
open-source early adopters as possible.  The goal was to make
Netscape's move look less singular&#8212;and to buy us insurance in case
Netscape executed poorly and failed its goals.</p><p>This was the most worrying time.  On the surface, everything seemed to
be coming up roses; Linux was moving technically from strength to
strength, the wider open-source phenomenon was enjoying a spectacular
explosion in trade press coverage, and we were even beginning to get
positive coverage in the mainstream press.  Nevertheless, I was
uneasily aware that our success was still fragile.  After an initial
flurry of contributions, community participation in Mozilla was badly
slowed down by its requirement for the proprietary Motif toolkit.
None of the big independent software vendors had yet committed to
Linux ports.  Netscape was still looking lonely, and its browser still
losing market share to Internet Explorer.  Any serious reverse could
lead to a nasty backlash in the press and public opinion.</p><p>Our first serious post-Netscape breakthrough came on 7 May when Corel
Computer announced its Linux-based Netwinder network computer. But
that wasn't enough in itself; to sustain the momentum, we needed
commitments not from hungry second-stringers but from industry
leaders.  Thus, it was the mid-July announcements by Oracle and
Informix that really closed out this vulnerable phase.</p><p>The database outfits joined the Linux party three months earlier than
I expected, but none too soon.  We had been wondering how long the
positive buzz could last without major ISV support and feeling
increasingly nervous about where we'd actually find that.  After
Oracle and Informix announced Linux ports other ISVs began announcing
Linux support almost as a matter of routine, and even a failure of
Mozilla became survivable.</p><p>Mid-July through the beginning of November was a consolidation
phase.  It was during this time that we started to see fairly steady
coverage from the financial media I had originally targeted, led off
by articles in <i>The Economist</i> and a cover story in
<i>Forbes</i>.  Various hardware and software vendors
sent out feelers to the open-source community and began to work out
strategies for getting advantage from the new model.  And internally,
the biggest closed-source vendor of them all was beginning to get
seriously worried.</p><p>Just <span class="emphasis"><em>how</em></span> worried became apparent when the
now-infamous <a href="http://www.opensource.org/halloween/" target="_top">Halloween
Documents</a> leaked out of Microsoft. These internal strategy
documents recognized the power of the open source model, and outlined
Microsoft's analysis of how to combat it by corrupting the open
protocols on which open source depends and choking off customer
choice.</p><p>The Halloween Documents were dynamite.  They were a ringing
testimonial to the strengths of open-source development from the
company with the most to lose from Linux's success.  And they
confirmed a lot of peoples' darkest suspicions about the tactics
Microsoft would consider in order to stop it.</p><p>The Halloween Documents attracted massive press coverage in the first
few weeks of November.  They created a new surge of interest in the
open-source phenomenon, serendipitously confirming all the points we
had been making for months.  And they led directly to a request for me
to confer with a select group of Merrill Lynch's major investors
on the state of the software industry and the prospects for open
source.  Wall Street, finally, came to us.</p><p>The following six months were a study in increasingly surreal
contrasts.  On the one hand, I was getting invited to give talks on
open source to Fortune 100 corporate strategists and technology
investors; for the first time in my life, I got to fly first class and
saw the inside of a stretch limousine.  On the other hand, I was doing
guerrilla street theater with grass-roots hackers&#8212;as in the
riotously funny Windows Refund Day demonstration of 15 March 1999,
when a band of Bay-area Linux users actually marched on the
Microsoft offices in the glare of full media coverage, demanding
refunds under the terms of the Microsoft End User License for the
unused Windows software that had been bundled with their machines.</p><p>I knew I was going to be in town that weekend to speak at a conference
hosted by the Reason Foundation, so I volunteered to be a marshal for
the event.  Back in December I'd been featured in a <a href="http://www.userfriendly.org/cartoons/archives/98dec/19981203.html" target="_top">
Star Wars parody plot</a> in the Internet comic strip &quot;User
Friendly&quot;. So I joked with the organizers about wearing an Obi-Wan
Kenobi costume at the demonstration.</p><p>To my surprise, when I arrived I found the organizers had actually
made a passable Jedi costume&#8212;and that's how I found myself leading 
a parade that featured cheeky placards and an American flag and 
a rather large plastic penguin, booming out &quot;May the Source be with
you!&quot; to delighted reporters.  To my further surprise, I was drafted
to make our statement to the press.</p><p>I suppose none of us should have really been astonished when the
video made CNBC.  The demonstration was a tremendous success.
Microsoft's PR position, still trying to recover from the exposure of
the Halloween Documents, took another body blow.  And within weeks,
major PC and laptop manufacturers began announcing that they would
ship machines with no Windows installed and no ``Microsoft tax'' in the
price.  Our bit of guerilla theater, it appeared, had struck
home.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s06.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s08.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">The Accidental Revolutionary </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> The Facts on the Ground</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
