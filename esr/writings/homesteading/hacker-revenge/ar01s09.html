record.  More importantly, it sets a background against which we can
understand near-term trends and project some things about the future.</p><p>First, safe predictions for the next year:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The open-source developer population will continue to
explode, a growth fueled by ever-cheaper PC hardware and fast Internet
connections.</p></li><li><p>Linux will continue to lead the way, the sheer size of
its developer community overpowering the higher average skill of the
open-source BSD people and the tiny HURD crew.</p></li><li><p>ISV commitments to support the Linux platform will
increase dramatically; the database-vendor commitments were a turning
point.</p></li><li><p>The Open Source campaign will continue to build on its
victories and successfully raise awareness at the CEO/CTO/CIO and
investor level.  MIS directors will feel increasing pressure to go
with open-source products not from below but from
<span class="emphasis"><em>above</em></span>.</p></li><li><p>Stealth deployments of Samba-over-Linux will replace
increasing numbers of NT machines even at shops that have
all-Microsoft policies.</p></li><li><p>The market share of proprietary Unixes will continue
to gradually erode.  At least one of the weaker competitors (likely
DG-UX or HP-UX) will actually fold.  But by the time it happens,
analysts will attribute it to Linux's gains rather than
Microsoft's.</p></li><li><p>Microsoft will not have an enterprise-ready operating
system, because Windows 2000 will not ship in a usable form.  (At 60
million lines of code and still bloating, its development is out of
control.)</p></li></ul></div><p>I wrote the above predictions in mid-December of 1998.  All
are still holding good as of November 2000, two years after
they were written.  Only the last one is arguable; Microsoft
managed to ship Windows 2000 by drastically curtailing its feature
list; adoption rates have not been what they hoped.</p><p>Extrapolating these trends certainly suggests some slightly
riskier predictions for the medium term (18 to 32 months out).</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Support operations for commercial customers of
open-source operating systems will become big business, both feeding
off of and fueling the boom in business use.</p><p>(This has already come true in 1999 with the launch of
LinuxCare, and Linux support-service announcements by IBM and HP and
others.)</p></li><li><p>Open-source operating systems (with Linux leading the
way) will capture the ISP and business data-center markets.  NT will
be unable to resist this change effectively; the combination of low
cost, open sources, and true 24/7 reliability will prove
unstoppable.</p></li><li><p>The proprietary-Unix sector will almost completely
collapse.  Solaris looks like a safe bet to survive on high-end Sun
hardware, but most other players' proprietary Unixes will quickly
become legacy systems. </p><p>(In early 2000 SGI's IRIX was dead-ended by official Linux
adoption within SGI itself, and in mid-2000 SCO agreed to be acquired
by Caldera.  It now looks probable that a number of Unix hardware
vendors will switch horses to Linux without much fuss, as SGI is
already well into the process of doing.)</p></li><li><p>Windows 2000 will be either canceled or dead on
arrival.  Either way it will turn into a horrendous train wreck, the
worst strategic disaster in Microsoft's history.  However, their
marketing spin on this failure will be so deft that it will barely
affect their hold on the consumer desktop within the next two
years.</p><p>(In mid-2000, a just-published IDG survey suggested that ``dead
on arrival'' looks more likely all the time, with most large corporate
respondents simply refusing to deploy the initial release and existing
deployments experiencing serious security and stability problems.  The
fact that Microsoft itself was cracked twice in late October/early
November of 2000 hardly helped.)</p></li></ul></div><p>At first glance, these trends look like a recipe for leaving Linux
as the last one standing.  But life is not that simple, and Microsoft
derives such immense amounts of money and market clout from the
desktop market that it can't safely be counted out even after the
Windows 2000 train wreck.</p><p>But there are also reasons to believe that Microsoft is going to
experience serious problems in 2001 that aren't related to either
Linux or the Department of Justice.  As hardware prices drop, the 59%
of Microsoft's revenues that come from selling fixed-price
preinstallation licenses to PC OEMs is under pressure.  Those fixed
license costs represent an ever-increasing slice of OEM's gross
margins; at some point, the OEMs are going to have to claw back some
of that last margin from Redmond in order to make any profits at all.
We know where the critical price point is from observing the appliance
and PDA market; it's at about $350 retail. On previous trends, desktop
prices will cross $350 going down well before midyear 2001&#8212;and
when that happens, OEMs will have to defect from the Microsoft camp to
survive.</p><p>Nor will it help Microsoft to respond in the obvious way by
charging a percentage of the system's retail price instead of a fixed
per-unit fee.  OEMs can easily fiddle that system by unbundling
expensive outboard components like the monitor&#8212;and even if they
didn't, Wall Street would regard such a move as an admmission that
Microsoft had lost control of its future revenues.  One way or
another, Microsoft's revenues look likely to crash hard long before
DOJ gets a final ruling.</p><p>So at two years out the crystal ball gets a bit cloudy.  Which of
several futures we get depends on questions like: will the DOJ
actually succeed in breaking up Microsoft?  Might BeOS or OS/2 or Mac
OS/X or some other niche closed-source OS, or some completely new
design, find a way to go open and compete effectively with Linux's
30-year-old base design?  At least Y2K fizzled...</p><p>These are all fairly imponderable.  But there is one such
question that is worth pondering: Will the Linux community actually
deliver a good end-user&#8211;friendly GUI interface for the whole
system?</p><p>In the 1999 first edition of this book, I said the most likely
scenario for late 2000/early 2001 has Linux in effective control of
servers, data centers, ISPs, and the Internet, while Microsoft
maintains its grip on the desktop.  By November 2000 this prediction
had proved out pretty completely except in large corporate data centers,
and there it looks very likely to be fulfilled within months.</p><p>Where things go from there depend on whether GNOME, KDE, or some
other Linux-based GUI (and the applications built or rebuilt to use
it) ever get good enough to challenge Microsoft on its home
ground.</p><p>If this were primarily a technical problem, the outcome would hardly
be in doubt.  But it isn't; it's a problem in ergonomic design and
interface psychology, and hackers have historically been poor at these
things.  That is, while hackers can be very good at designing
interfaces for other hackers, they tend to be poor at modeling the
thought processes of the other 95% of the population well enough to
write interfaces that J. Random End-User and his Aunt Tillie will pay
to buy.</p><p>Applications were 1999's problem; it's now clear we'll swing
enough ISVs to get the ones we don't write ourselves.  I believe the
problem for 2001 and later is whether we can grow enough to meet (and
<span class="emphasis"><em>exceed</em></span>!) the interface-design quality standard
set by the Macintosh, combining that with the virtues of the
traditional Unix way.</p><p>As of mid-2000, help may be on the way from the inventors of the
Macintosh!  Andy Hertzfeld and other members of the original Macintosh
design team have formed a open-source company called Eazel with the
explicit goal of bringing the Macintosh magic to Linux.</p><p>We half-joke about `world domination', but the only way we will
get there is by <span class="emphasis"><em>serving</em></span> the world.  That means
J. Random End-User and his Aunt Tillie; and <span class="emphasis"><em>that</em></span>
means learning how to think about what we do in a fundamentally new
way, and ruthlessly reducing the user-visible complexity of the
default environment to an absolute minimum.</p><p>Computers are tools for human beings.  Ultimately, therefore, the
challenges of designing hardware and software must come back to
designing for human beings&#8212;<span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> human beings.</p><p>This path will be long, and it won't be easy.  But I think the hacker
community, in alliance with its new friends in the corporate world,
will prove up to the task.  And, as Obi-Wan Kenobi might say, ``the 
Source will be with us''.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s08.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> </td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">The Facts on the Ground </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table></div></body></html>
