reward mechanisms, we now need to understand why it has seemed so
important that this fact remain semi-covert and largely unadmitted.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The contrast with the pirate culture is instructive.  In that culture,
status-seeking behavior is overt and even blatant.  These crackers
seek acclaim for releasing ``zero-day warez'' (cracked software
redistributed on the day of the original uncracked version's release)
but are closemouthed about how they do it. These magicians don't like
to give away their tricks.  And, as a result, the knowledge base of
the cracker culture as a whole increases only slowly.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the hacker community, by contrast, one's work is one's
statement.  There's a very strict meritocracy (the best craftsmanship
wins) and there's a strong ethos that quality should (indeed
<span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">must</i></span>) be left to speak for itself.  The best brag
is code that ``just works'', and that any competent programmer can see
is good stuff.  Thus, the hacker culture's knowledge base increases
rapidly.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The taboo against ego-driven posturing therefore increases productivity.
But that's a second-order effect; what is being directly protected
here is the quality of the information in the community's
peer-evaluation system.  That is, boasting or self-importance is
suppressed because it behaves like noise tending to corrupt the vital
signals from experiments in creative and cooperative behavior.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For very similar reasons, attacking the author rather than the code is
not done.  There is an interesting subtlety here that reinforces the
point; hackers feel very free to flame each other over ideological and
personal differences, but it is unheard of for any hacker to publicly
attack another's competence at technical work (even private criticism
is unusual and tends to be muted in tone).  Bug-hunting and criticism
are always project-labeled, not person-labeled.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, past bugs are not automatically held against a
developer; the fact that a bug has been fixed is generally considered
more important than the fact that one used to be there.  As one
respondent observed, one can gain status by fixing `Emacs bugs', but
not by fixing `Richard Stallman's bugs'&#8212;and it would be considered
extremely bad form to criticize Stallman for <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">old</i></span>
Emacs bugs that have since been fixed.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This makes an interesting contrast with many parts of academia, in
which trashing putatively defective work by others is an important
mode of gaining reputation.  In the hacker culture, such behavior
is rather heavily tabooed&#8212;so heavily, in fact, that the
absence of such behavior did not present itself to me as a datum until
that one respondent with an unusual perspective pointed it out nearly
a full year after this essay was first published!</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The taboo against attacks on competence (not shared with academia) is
even more revealing than the (shared) taboo on posturing, because we
can relate it to a difference between academia and hackerdom in their
communications and support structures.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The hacker culture's medium of gifting is intangible, its
communications channels are poor at expressing emotional nuance, and
face-to-face contact among its members is the exception rather than
the rule.  This gives it a lower tolerance of noise than most other
gift cultures, and goes a long way to explain both the taboo against
posturing and the taboo against attacks on competence.  Any
significant incidence of flames over hackers' competence would
intolerably disrupt the culture's reputation scoreboard.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The same vulnerability to noise explains the model of public
humility required of the hacker community's tribal elders.  They must
be seen to be free of boast and posturing so the taboo against
dangerous noise will hold. <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="ar01s22.html#dc">[DC]</a></p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Talking softly is also functional if one aspires to be a
maintainer of a successful project; one must convince the community
that one has good judgement, because most of the maintainer's job is
going to be judging other people's code.  Who would be inclined to
contribute work to someone who clearly can't judge the quality of
their own code, or whose behavior suggests they will attempt to
unfairly hog the reputation return from the project?  Potential
contributors want project leaders with enough humility and class to be
able to to say, when objectively appropriate, ``Yes, that does work
better than my version, I'll use it''&#8212;and to give credit where
credit is due.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Yet another reason for humble behavior is that in the open source
world, you seldom want to give the impression that a project is
`done'.  This might lead a potential contributor not to feel needed.
The way to maximize your leverage is to be humble about the state of
the program. If one does one's bragging through the code, and then says
``Well shucks, it doesn't do x, y, and z, so it can't be that good'',
patches for x, y, and z will often swiftly follow.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, I have personally observed that the self-deprecating behavior
of some leading hackers reflects a real (and not unjustified) fear of
becoming the object of a personality cult.  Linus Torvalds and Larry
Wall both provide clear and numerous examples of such avoidance
behavior.  Once, on a dinner expedition with Larry Wall, I joked
``You're the alpha hacker here&#8212;you get to pick the restaurant''.
He flinched noticeably.  And rightly so; failing to distinguish their
shared values from the personalities of their leaders has ruined a
good many voluntary communities, a pattern of which Larry and Linus
cannot fail to be fully aware.  On the other hand, most hackers would
love to have Larry's problem, if they could but bring themselves to
admit it.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s10.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s12.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">The Problem of Ego </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Global Implications of the Reputation-Game Model</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
