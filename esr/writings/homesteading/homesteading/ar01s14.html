it will help us to look at them from yet another angle; that of animal
ethology, specifically the ethology of territory.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Property is an abstraction of animal territoriality, which evolved as
a way of reducing intraspecies violence.  By marking his bounds, and
respecting the bounds of others, a wolf diminishes his chances of
being in a fight that could weaken or kill him and make him less
reproductively successful.  Similarly, the function of property in
human societies is to prevent inter-human conflict by setting bounds
that clearly separate peaceful behavior from aggression.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is fashionable in some circles to describe human property as an
arbitrary social convention, but this is dead wrong.  Anybody who has
ever owned a dog who barked when strangers came near its owner's
property has experienced the essential continuity between animal
territoriality and human property.  Our domesticated cousins of the
wolf know, instinctively, that property is no mere social convention
or game, but a critically important evolved mechanism for the
avoidance of violence.  (This makes them smarter than a good many human
political theorists.)</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Claiming property (like marking territory) is a performative act, a
way of declaring what boundaries will be defended.  Community support
of property claims is a way to minimize friction and maximize
cooperative behavior.  These things remain true even when the
``property claim'' is much more abstract than a fence or a dog's bark,
even when it's just the statement of the project maintainer's name in
a README file.  It's still an abstraction of territoriality, and (like
other forms of property) based in territorial instincts evolved to
assist conflict resolution.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This ethological analysis may at first seem very abstract and
difficult to relate to actual hacker behavior.  But it has some
important consequences. One is in explaining the popularity of World
Wide Web sites, and especially why open-source projects with websites
seem so much more `real' and substantial than those without
them.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Considered objectively, this seems hard to explain.  Compared to the
effort involved in originating and maintaining even a small program,
a web page is easy, so it's hard to consider a web page evidence
of substance or unusual effort.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nor are the functional characteristics of the Web itself sufficient
explanation.  The communication functions of a web page can be as well
or better served by a combination of an FTP site, a mailing list, and
Usenet postings.  In fact it's quite unusual for a project's routine
communications to be done over the Web rather than via a mailing list
or newsgroup.  Why, then, the popularity of websites as project
homes?</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The metaphor implicit in the term `home page' provides an important
clue.  While founding an open-source project is a territorial claim
in the noosphere (and customarily recognized as such) it is not a
terribly compelling one on the psychological level.  Software, after
all, has no natural location and is instantly reduplicable.  It's
assimilable to our instinctive notions of `territory' and `property',
but only after some effort.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A project home page concretizes an abstract homesteading in the space
of possible programs by expressing it as `home' territory in the more
spatially-organized realm of the World Wide Web.  Descending from the
noosphere to `cyberspace' doesn't get us all the way to the real world
of fences and barking dogs yet, but it does hook the abstract property
claim more securely to our instinctive wiring about territory.  And
this is why projects with web pages seem more `real'.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This point is much strengthened by hyperlinks and the existence of
good search engines.  A project with a web page is much more
likely to be noticed by somebody exploring its neighborhood in the
noosphere; others will link to it, searches will find it.  A web page
is therefore a better advertisement, a more effective performative
act, a stronger claim on territory.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This ethological analysis also encourages us to look more closely
at mechanisms for handling conflict in the open-source culture. It
leads us to expect that, in addition to maximizing reputation
incentives, ownership customs should also have a role in preventing
and resolving conflicts.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s13.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s15.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">How Fine a Gift?  </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Causes of Conflict</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
