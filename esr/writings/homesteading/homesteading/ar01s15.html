major issues:</p><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Who gets to make binding decisions about a
project?</p></li><li xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Who gets credit or blame for what?</p></li><li xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> How to reduce duplication of effort and prevent rogue
       versions from complicating bug tracking?</p></li><li xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> What is the Right Thing, technically
speaking?</p></li></ul></div><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If we take a second look at the ``What is the Right Thing'' issue,
however, it tends to vanish.  For any such question, either there is
an objective way to decide it accepted by all parties or there isn't.
If there is, game over and everybody wins.  If there isn't, it reduces
to ``Who decides?''.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Accordingly, the three problems a conflict-resolution theory has to
resolve about a project are (a) where the buck stops on design
decisions, (b) how to decide which contributors are credited and how,
and (c) how to keep a project group and product from fissioning into
multiple branches.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The role of ownership customs in resolving issues (a) and (c) is
clear.  Custom affirms that the owners of the project make the binding
decisions.  We have previously observed that custom also exerts heavy
pressure against dilution of ownership by forking.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It's instructive to notice that these customs make sense even if one
forgets the reputation game and examines them from within a pure
`craftmanship' model of the hacker culture.  In this view these
customs have less to do with the dilution of reputation incentives
than with protecting a craftsman's right to execute his vision in his
chosen way.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The craftsmanship model is not, however, sufficient to explain
hacker customs about issue (b), who gets credit for what&#8212;because a
pure craftsman, one unconcerned with the reputation game, would have
no motive to care.  To analyze these, we need to take the Lockean
theory one step further and examine conflicts and the operation of
property rights <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">within</i></span> projects as well as
