confounded many of the assumptions of people who learned about
software development outside it.  <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Cathedral and the
Bazaar</i> <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="ar01s20.html#CatB">[CatB]</a> described the
ways in which decentralized cooperative software development
effectively overturns Brooks's Law, leading to unprecedented levels of
reliability and quality on individual projects.
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Homesteading the Noosphere</i> <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="ar01s20.html#HtN">[HtN]</a> examined the social dynamics within which
this `bazaar' style of development is situated, arguing that it is
most effectively understood not in conventional exchange-economy terms
but as what anthropologists call a `gift culture' in which members
compete for status by giving things away.  In this essay I begin by
exploding some common myths about software production economics; then
continue the line of analysis of these essays into the realm of
economics, game theory and business models, developing new conceptual
tools needed to understand the way that the gift culture of
open-source developers can sustain itself in an exchange
economy.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to pursue this line of analysis without distraction,
we'll need to abandon (or at least agree to temporarily ignore) the
`gift culture' level of explanation. <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Homesteading the
Noosphere</i> <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="ar01s20.html#HtN">[HtN]</a> posited that
gift culture behavior arises in situations where survival goods are
abundant enough to make the exchange game no longer very interesting;
but while this appears sufficiently powerful as a
<span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">psychological</i></span> explanation of behavior, it lacks
suffiency as an explanation of the mixed <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">economic</i></span>
context in which most open-source developers actually operate.  For
most, the exchange game has lost its appeal but not its power to
constrain.  Their behavior has to make sufficient
material-scarcity&#8211;economics sense to keep them in a
gift-culture&#8211;supporting zone of surplus.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Therefore, this essay will consider (from entirely
<span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">within</i></span> the realm of scarcity economics) the modes
of cooperation and exchange that sustain open-source development.
While doing so it will answer the pragmatic question ``How do I make
money at this?'', in detail and with examples.  First, though, I will
show that much of the tension behind that question derives from
prevailing folk models of software-production economics that are false
to fact.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(A final note before the exposition: the discussion and advocacy
of open-source development in this essay should not be construed as a
case that closed-source development is intrinsically wrong, nor as a
brief against intellectual-property rights in software, nor as an
altruistic appeal to `share'.  While these arguments are still beloved
of a vocal minority in the open-source development community,
experience since <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Cathedral and the Bazaar</i>
was published has made it clear that they are unnecessary.  An
entirely sufficient case for open-source development rests on its
engineering and economic outcomes&#8212;better quality, higher
reliability, lower costs, and increased choice.)</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="index.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s03.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">The Magic Cauldron </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> The Manufacturing Delusion</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
