<h1 class="c1">Icelandic Showerheads Rule!</h1>

<p>I begin this report sitting at a desk in a luxury suite in the
Hotel Borg (no, not cubical; in Icelandic the name means
"outcropping"), surrounded by old-world luxury. Or what passes for
luxury in Reykjavik, Iceland, anyway. Nice chandeliers and rugs and
quaint folk paintings on the walls and good solid furniture like
you might find in a well-to-do private home. Very large feather
bed. But the bed doesn't have a top sheet, and the Internet access
here is a cruel tease &mdash; it turns out to be a Windows machine with
one dialout line in a little cubbyhole off the lobby
downstairs.</p>

<p>My wife Cathy and I landed here at 6:45am local time yesterday
after a long night flight over the Atlantic. The sun was just
rising as we hit the road from Keflavik airport to Reykjavik city,
and the drive there was a perfect metaphor for the country's two
faces. The busy highway, an emblem of modern Western normality, cut
through a bleak lansdcape of moorland and lava flows, washed with
pearly light from great jagged decks of grey cloud. Three feet off
the road margin, it was clear that little had changed since the
first Viking settlers landed twelve hundred years ago.</p>

<p>On the way into town, we stopped at a gas station and bought
something about which we had read in the guidebooks and become
curious &mdash; hardfiskur, a sort of dried or jerked haddock eaten as a
snack with butter. Our local contact, grinning, asked us not to
open the stuff inside his car &mdash; "The smell lingers for days," he
said.</p>

<p>As we settled into the Hotel Borg, it became apparent that
modern Iceland is in many respects a typical Nordic country &mdash;
which is to say that the people are polite and handsome and
well-spoken and usually understand English, everything is neat and
clean and well ordered, the weather is cold but tolerable, the food
is filling but bland, and in general the place is as boring as
hell.</p>

<p>Well, that's too harsh really. But having been to Norway and
Sweden and Denmark and now here, these are not places you would
come seeking wild excitement (and I hear Finland is even less
plausible that way). Sensual these cultures are not &mdash; while there
are good times to be had, they're largely either food for the
forebrain or the stark and direct experience of a rather chilly
natural beauty.</p>

<p>In the food-for-the-forebrain category, I did get to see some
original saga manuscripts at Reykjavik University that first day at
the end of our city tour, barely seven hours after we'd gotten off
the plane. That was satisfying &mdash; the Icelanders may have spent
most of their thousand-year history as peasants doing ragged-edge
subsistence farming, but they are rightly proud of their saga
literature. These are epic tales of conflict and passion and honor
written in a deceptively simple style that has stood the test of
time quite well.</p>

<p>I've read a number of the major Icelandic sagas (the Saga of
Burnt Njal, Egil's Saga, the Laxadaela Saga, the two Vinland sagas)
and it was especially interesting to see the original of the
Flateyjarb&oacute;k, which is one of the major manuscript sources.
Among other things, it contains the only primary copy of the Saga
of the Greenlanders, the earlier and more reliable of the two
`Vinland Sagas' describing the Viking explorartion of North
America.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, saga manuscripts are about the <em>only</em>
Icelandic historical artifacts worth mentioning &mdash; take a
`historical tour' of Reykjavik and most of what they'll show you is
mediocre 20th-century statues of Leif Ericson and the like. The
architecture was produced by a late and hasty urbanization, and
that shows &mdash; it's mostly drab concrete buildings in an
ill-assorted jumble of modernist styles. The attempts to give them
character with traditional Nordic touches like bright colors and
steep-pitched gable roofs are brave and well-meant, but largely
failures.</p>

<p>Except at dusk. Reykjavik looks its best in the long sub-arctic
sunset; the bluish light of evening masks the gray of concrete and
picks out the colors, giving the place an almost magical air like
an illustration from a Hans Christian Anderson fairytale. The
locals are quite aware of this effect and enhance it with a galaxy
of decorative lights.</p>

<p>Had a pleasant dinner with Alan Cox and Telsa Gwynne that night.
My entree was a "wild game feast" &mdash; medallions of reindeer, wild
goose (Cathy had a wild-goose entree), and puffin. The puffin was
the interesting bit; strong-flavored, not unpleasant, but oily.</p>

<p>Icelanders like to remind foreigners that Reykjavik is the
cleanest capitol city in the world, its heat and electricity
supplied by geothermal energy direct from the plutonic heart of the
Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Reykjavik's tapwater, in fact, comes direct
from volcanic hot springs. What the locals don't dwell on is the
perceptible tang of sulphur in the stuff.</p>

<p>My second morning here I learned that the hot-spring water makes
taking a shower in Iceland a rather unique experience. These
people have never heard of low-flow showerheads; the traditional
style is about three feet wide and sits directly overhead, so
standing under one is rather like being doused with hot rain that
smells faintly of rotten eggs.</p>

<p>Alan Cox and Telsa Gwynne were excellent company for breakfast.
We explored the dubious mysteries of the smorgasbord together (yes,
you too can munch on pickled herring before you're properly
awake!). The Icelandic smorgasboard differs from its
continental-Nordic counterparts in a few details; they eat more
sweet pastries, for one thing, and don't have any tradition of
those coarse oat flatbreads (resembling nothing so much as roofing
shingles) that are such a favorite with the Norwegians and Danish.
Wherever the Icelanders buy their tea from, it's pretty good. Their
bread is remarkably tasty, too.</p>

<p>My talk that afternoon went well. I got to listen to Alan talk
about the 2.4 kernel. Otherwise, the conference was conducted in
Icelandic. This means I could barely understand a word of it, but
on the other hand I got to listen to a large enough volume of
spoken Icelandic for the linguistic pattern-recognition machinery
in my brain to start firing.</p>

<p>I knew it was beyond hope for me to pick up more than a few
words of Icelandic during a three-day stay &mdash; the language is
knotty and complex, so havily inflected that it's often hard to
recognize the same word-root in different grammatical roles. But I
did learn one useful trick by listening to my hosts; how to tell
spoken Icelandic from the other Nordic languages. Listen for the
rolled `r' sound.</p>

<p>It's easy to recognize a Nordic tongue by the characteristic
cadence of these languages and the distribution of consonant
clusters. In fact, spoken Icelandic sounds rather more like spoken
Norwegian, Swedish and Danish than I had expected from looking at
the written language. However there are perceptible differences,
and one of them is the way `r' is normally pronounced.</p>

<p>Danish `r' is a back or uvular sound, like the French `r' (think
of the initial sound in `rouge' or `royale'). In the Swedish and
city-Norwegian dialects I've heard, `r' is a voiced palato-alveolar
approximant sound like the American or (slightly different) British
`r'. But in Icelandic it's a full trilled 'r' like the middle
consonant in Spanish `corrida'. Icelanders often speak Norwegian or
Danish as a second language, and the ones I discussed this with
agreed that this rule is good.</p>

<p>Icelandic orthography is a good match to the spoken language,
and Icelandic is in general pretty easy for an English-speaker with
a good ear to pronounce correctly &mdash; unlike, for example, Danish,
where the spoken and written forms of the language are so divergent
that seeing a word written down is no help or an actual hindrance
when it comes to pronunciation. There are a couple of quirks,
though; the distinction between thorn and edh is one, and what
Icelanders do to "ll" is another.</p>

<p>Old Norse distinguished between the unvoiced `th' of `thick'
(written thorn, &thorn;) and the voiced `th' of `clothes' (written
edh, &eth;). English and the other Scandinavian language have almost
entirely<a href="#footnote"><sup>*</sup></a> lost
this distinction, but Icelandic preserves it. Also, the sound
written `ll' tends to turn into a sort of flapped `tl' sound as in
English `bottle' &mdash; I've heard Icelanders argue about whether this
too was true in old Norse or whether it's a development of the last
few centuries.</p>

<p>Despite minor changes in spoken pronunciation, written Icelandic
remains a deeply conservative, even archaic language. Icelandic
schoolchildren of today can read without effort transcriptions of
manuscripts nearly a thousand years old. The persistence of saga
literature is both a cause and a consequence of this
conservatism.</p>

<p>Another consequence of Icelandic's archaism is that, to an
Icelander used to its grammatical complexities, modern Scandinavian
tongues and English sound rather like nursery talk or a crude
pidgin language. It's not easy to get one to admit this,
however.</p>

<p>That night we had dinner at Reykjavik's poshest restaurant, the
Pearl. The place is, of all things, built on top of Reykjavik's
municipal water tanks. We're told they used to be a huge eyesore,
until they were shrouded by a concrete shell with an elegant glass dome
on top. Under the dome is a ritzy dining spot, studiedly high-style,
all tuxedoed waiters and Persian carpets. We went there with Alan and
Telsa and the other conference speakers and organizers.</p>

<p>We got a bit of a look at what Icelanders can be like when they
get a few drinks in them and let their hair down. Gylfi, a
business-suited HP salesman in his day life, taught everyone the
arcane art of suspending spoons from their noses. (Somewhere in
Iceland there are pictures of me, spoon hung from my nose, with my
hands making mudras in the manner of a Zen meditator...) Alan
courageously drank a glass of a lethal, schnapps-like native
liqueur the Icelanders call "Svarti Dau&eth;i" or "Black Death".
Long talk over tea, coffee, and chocolates after an excellent
dinner; the party didn't break up until nearly one in the
morning.</p>

<p>And the third day...as I write this I'm sitting in an Icelandic
jeep, bucketing north along the road out of Reykjavik. An Icelandic
'jeep' is actually a customized SUV, often a Toyota Land Cruiser,
fitted with fat oversized tires and a GPS and CB radio, meant for
off-road driving in the bleak landscapes of the island's interior
(Icelanders will tell you proudly that NASA astronauts have used
the Icelandic interior to train for moon walks). These vehicles
seem to be prized status symbols among Reykjavik's computer
hackers; they fuss over them and compare accessories like American
hot-rodders.</p>

<p>We're part of a convoy of three jeeps. We're headed towards the
&THORN;ingvellir, the thousand-year-old meeting place of the
Icelandic Althing or popular assembly. The landscape around us is
moorlands so barren they're almost a cold desert. Rugged
snow-marbled mountains ring the horizon, and plumes of steam vented
from the ubiquitous hot springs drift over gnarled lava flows. The
only green in this landscape is the lichen on the rocks &mdash; but our
driver, Einar, tells us that this is an unusually mild winter; the
roads are clear, and the snow is only patchy.</p>

<p>The &THORN;ingvellir itself sits on one edge of a crack in the
world. Where the Mid-Atlantic ridge runs roughly
northeast-southwest through Iceland, there's a three- or
four-mile-wide rift valley wedged between the European and American
tectonic plates. We can see clear across it from the overlook
point; some steep-gabled houses built on the flat floor of the rift
valley give a sense of scale to the scene.</p>

<p>Off to one side is the fabled Law Rock, the place where the
legal code of viking-era Iceland was recited twice a year by the
law-speakers, whose job it was to commit the entirety of it to
memory. It was here that some of the most famous scenes in the
sagas took place, and here that the last pagan law-speaker made the
famous remark that "If the law is split, the people will be split"
just before his regrettable decision to accept the Christianization
of Iceland.</p>

<p>The next place we visited was a small, dormant volcanic stack
nearby, perhaps fifteen feet high. It looks like a child's
drip-castle hardened into lava. There's a vent in the center that
leads down to unguessable depths. The area around it is clinker and
tephra, with stuff on it that looks like black soil until you
realize it's actually volcanic ash. But after that we descended a
few hundred feet into less forbidding country; we saw grass,
farmsteads, and even a few small herds of stocky, shaggy-maned
Icelandic horses grazing in the mild weather.</p>

<p>A few miles further on we come to Geysir. This is the place that
gave English the word "geyser" &mdash; a three-kilometer-square field of
steam vents, geysers, mudpots, and fumaroles that looks like the
back-lot of Dante's inferno. Our local friends told us the whole
area had gotten much more active since an earthquake last year. The
biggest of the steam vents, Geysir itself, only erupts a few times
a day; we didn't get to see it go off. But one of the lesser ones,
a geyser called `Strokkur', erupted several times while we were
there, disgorging a huge plume of hot steam. We got to see this
from barely thirty feet away.</p>

<p>The Icelanders told us that fully 1/3 of the active volcanoes in
the world are located in Iceland. This becomes credible after
you've seen your dozenth lava flow, and very easy to believe after
Geysir.</p>

<p>Geysir is very near the inward edge of human habitation on
Iceland; past it, the country rises into the glaciers and barren
mountains of the interior. That's where we were headed &mdash; to
Gullfoss waterfall, a famously beautiful cataract on a river of
glacial meltwater so frigid that nothing lives in it until much
closer to the sea.</p>

<p>The waterfall lives up to its billing &mdash; an intricate cascade
foaming in a dramatically high and narrow gorge. It's a symphony in
sheer cliffs, mist, and deadly cold water, worthy of a Wagnerian
opera. To see it is to be reminded how narrow the margin of human
existence is here &mdash; if Iceland were just a few degrees colder even
the coasts would be like this, and the whole place would be
uninhabitable.</p>

<p>Soon after Gullfoss it was time to go off-road towards our
ultimate destination, the glacier Langj&ouml;kull. We stopped for a
break in the snowfield just off the road, and the driver of one of
the other jeeps announced a surprise. The surprise turned out to be
a haunch of cold raw lamb that had been smoked for preservation &mdash;
"Viking food" he explained. Cathy and I figured it was the right
time to bring out the hardfiskur we'd hauled along.</p>

<p>The dozen or so people on the expedition stood around the jeeps
in the ankle-deep snow, carving flitches off the smoked lamb with
pocketknives and eating it contemplatively, varying the pace with
mouthfuls of the hardfiskur. The fish turns out to taste less like
insulation material than it looks, but not that much less like. The
lamb tasted oily and strong. I think I understand now why the
Vikings ravaged Europe &mdash; if that's what their home cooking was
like it's no wonder they were desperate to be anywhere else.</p>

<p>This was the point at which things started to get a little
dicey. Mountain driving in Iceland is not a sport for the faint of
heart, and it's considered dangerous foolishness to go offroad in
groups of less than two or three vehicles. We began to find out why
in that snowfield, when the jeep Cathy and I were in had to haul
the one Alan and Telsa were in out of drifted snow with a rope.</p>

<p>After that our convoy mushed through stark white snowfields for
an hour and a half, but conditions were worsening. Visibility was
OK but the snowpack had softened in the comparatively warm weather,
and even the balloon tires of the big jeeps couldn't keep them from
repeatedly bogging down.</p>

<p>The last stop on the nature tour was to have been the top of
Langj&ouml;kull, but Alan and Telsa's jeep (the heaviest of the
three) proved unable to make it through the deep snow. We had to
stop ten or so kilometers short of the glacier. After a break for
sandwiches and tea and coffee and chocolate, we headed back down
towards civilization. Sigurj&oacute;n, the driver of the heavy
jeep, came in for a good deal of ribbing over the radio in
Icelandic, some of which our friends translated for us. The
downhill run was easy; the biggest suspense was whether some of us
would get to a toilet in time, and in the event there were no
further mishaps.</p>

<p>Alas, the aftermath of our expedition was not so pleasant. Alan
and Cathy got food poisoning that evening, nausea and vomiting and
the whole nine yards. We're fairly sure it was that smoked lamb &mdash;
though Telsa and I, who also had the stuff, were completely
unaffected. Took them a day and a half to recover, and Cathy wasn't
entirely herself again until halfway home on the plane.</p>

<p>We got our stark and direct experience of natural beauty, all
right. Not to mention a Viking heritage experience that caught some
of us a good kick in the gut...but we're glad we went there anyway.
Iceland truly is not quite like anywhere else, and that's the point
of travel, isn't it?</p>
