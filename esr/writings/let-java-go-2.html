<p>Sun Microsystems might have responded to my open letter of 12 Feb
(<a href='http://catb.org/~esr/writings/let-java-go.html'>Let Java
Go</a>) by at least sketching a rational business case for Sun's
rather inconsistent stance towards the open-source community; that
might have led to an interesting discussion.  Instead, Sun seems to
have elected to try to <a
href='http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/news_story.php?id=53646'>shoot
the messenger</a>.  This is unfortunate and not what I expected.  Nor
is it likely to win Sun friends or influence people &mdash; after all,
I was only writing what many people in the open-source community
(including many of Sun's own employees) are thinking.</p>

<p>The response comes from Simon Phipps, Sun's Chief Technology
Evangelist.  Note that I have to go by published reports of his
response, as Sun did not extend the courtesy of sending me a full copy
and I have not yet seen one. It is possible that Mr. Phipps's full
remarks are more sensible; I certainly hope they are, as the excerpts
suggest an astonishing lack of professionalism on someone's part.</p>

<p>Mr. Phipps objects to my having responded to remarks Scott McNealy
made to analysts as though they had been addressed to the open-source
community. I deduce from his objection that Mr. Phipps thinks his boss
has a right to tell conflicting stories to different audiences without
being called on it.  I suppose it is possible that analysts accept
being handed spin and fabulations, but we in the open-source community
do not.</p>

<p>In general, if you call yourself a "friend of open source"
<em>anywhere</em> in public, you'd best expect the open-source
community to have an equally public opinion about whether you really
are one or not &mdash; and not to be shy about expressing that
opinion, either, whether it's through me or any one of half-a-dozen
other community spokespeople.</p>

<p>Mr. Phipps then launches into a list of Sun projects that he
characterizes as contributions to open source.  The proper response to
this is to ask: where's the code?  Marketing and spin and
'initiatives' are all very well, but what code is Sun issuing under
licenses conformant to the <a
href='http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php'>Open Source
Definition</a>?  That, ultimately, is what the community cares about.
Show us the code.</p>

<p>Mr.  Phipps could have said "OpenOffice.org" and had the beginnings
of a good answer; instead he chose to wave a flag for projects like
Java Enterprise System that primarily <rem>use</em> open-source
technology without contributing significantly back to it.  By doing
so, Mr. Phipps harms his own case.  While we in the open-source
community are happy to see our technology being used and propagated,
that is not enough in itself to qualify Sun as a "friend"; only
serious contributions of money, manpower and especially <em>code</em>
can do that.  He would have been well advised to spend more time
listing those and less on an ad-hominem attack.</p>

<p>If Mr. Phipps truly thinks "Java is everywhere" Sun may be setting
itself up for a rude shock.  I did some research on language use
patterns for my <a href='http://catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/'>most
recent book</a>; it revealed that Java is not only still a minority
language in the open-source community but that it has not gained
significant mindshare there since 1997.  Given the adoption curve of
open source this is much worse news for Sun than it looks like &mdash;
it suggests that in the fastest-growing and most dynamic part of the
software industry, Java has lost the edge.  Nor is the reason hard to
find; no amount of talk or posturing can change the fact that Java's
"Sun Community Source License" is an instrument of proprietary
lock-in, and most open-source developers simply do not want any part
of that.</p>

<p>But the most serious problem in Mr. Phipps's statements (at least,
in the excerpts that I have of them) is his claim that Sun exercises no
more control over Java than anyone else in the Java Community Process.
This is simply false: <em>Sun controls the license.</em> If and when
the Sun Java codebase is open-sourced, it will be Sun's decision and
Sun's <em>alone</em> to do that. Again, Mr. Phipps damages Sun's case
by the manner in which he chooses to defend it.  Hiding behind the
"Java Community Process" is disingenuous and dishonest.</p>

<p>We don't presume to dictate Sun's strategy.  But what we
<em>do</em> require of anyone before we will accept them as a "friend
of the open-source community" is more honesty than this.  Sun should
be nervous about the consequences of allowing its spokespeople to
indulge in flames, spin, and prevarication when there are serious
issues on the table.  Because an attempt to shoot the messenger won't
make those issues go away; indeed, it makes some of them worse.</p>

<p>Can we do better than this?  I did not publish my letter to attack
Sun, only to call it to account for its claim to be a friend of open
source. There are questions that need answers. There is a potential
for more and better cooperation.  The open source community would like
"friendship" with Sun to be real and solid from both ends &mdash; but
the nature of our community is such that the statement of positions,
the argument, and the agreement (if there is to be one) all have to be
developed in the sight of the community. Let's talk.</p>
