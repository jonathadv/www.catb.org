<h1 class="c1">Why Libertarians Should Not Love Bill Gates</h1>

<p>Bill Gates seems to confuse the thinking of a lot of
libertarians. The Department of Justice antitrust lawsuit has
spawned among libertarians at least two vocal camps of opinion both
of which bid fair to damage libertarian credibility.</p>

<p>One camp holds that Bill Gates is a big enough devil to justify
the government in coercively putting him down. Another camp
(largely, and predictably, composed of Randites) canonizes Gates,
casting him in the Roarkian role of hero-entrepreneur beset by
statist little men.</p>

<p>The argument of the devil-Gates crowd is that the Microsoft
monopoly is a classic case of market failure, requiring government
intervention to set it right. These people need a remedial course
in economic history; the antitrust laws have a very bad record,
having been used mainly as a tool with which to reward the
well-connected and injure the politically disfavored. Thus, it
would not be a sufficient defense of antitrust law to establish
that it happens to be whacking a real villain this time. We have to
look at its accumulated record over time.</p>

<p>After all, even legislation as wrongheaded as the anti-drug and
anti-gun laws catches a real villain occasionally. As libertarians
we judge the cost in lost freedom too high for the good they
occasionally do. So too we should judge antitrust law.</p>

<p>Market failure is only solved by freer markets. Historically,
monopolies are unstable with a half-life of around fifteen years
unless propped up by government-created barriers to market entry.
Any public-choice economist will tell you that government
intervention is chronically subject to <em>political</em> failure,
a cure worse than the disease. In fact, not only does government
intervention fail to be a reliable cure for `market failure', it is
the primary <em>cause</em> of market failure -- as Theodor Vail,
the founder of the government-sanctioned Bell Telephone monopoly,
knew full well.</p>

<p>The devil-Gates crowd is making a bad mistake, copying statist
rhetoric and statist arguments in a way that will end up benefiting
only statists. But the hero-Gates crowd is doing something much
worse. <em>They</em> are teaching non-libertarians that
libertarians cannot be relied upon to condemn behavior that is
clearly wrong.</p>

<p>In some other contexts, libertarians routinely distinguish
between behavior which is criminal (aggression, fraud) and behavior
which, though not criminal and indeed protected by individual
rights, is nevertheless wrong (hate speech being perhaps the
classic example).</p>

<p>We have no difficulty both defending the hate-speaker's right
not to be censored and condemning the hateful content. Similarly,
we should be able to defend Microsoft's right not to be coerced by
would-be `trustbusters' while condemning Microsoft business
practices that are genuinely monopolistic and injure the software
consumer.</p>

<p>Whatever one may think of the law underlying the DOJ suit, the
trial evidence exposes a long-established pattern of Microsoft
seeking monopoly lock-in through mendacity, intimidation and
anticompetitive tactics such as tying agreements. The <a
href="http://catb.org/esr/halloween/">Halloween Documents</a>
amply confirm the sleaziness of Microsoft tactics with Microsoft's
own words.</p>

<p>Libertarians must be willing to forthrightly <em>condemn</em>
such behavior. Otherwise we will justly be accused of desiring a
future in which such tactics are the norm. If we are not willing to
be part of the market `invisible hand' that non-coercively punishes
Microsoft for its misbehavior, we invite the argument that only
coercion will do.</p>

<p>The only principled response to the facts is to condemn both the
DOJ <em>and</em> Microsoft. That one party is a villain does not
make the other a saint, and even the fact that one side is clearly
using coercion does not automatically redeem the other from the
charge of having behaved badly.</p>

<p>Indeed, publicly taking a position condemning both antitrust law
and Microsoft could provide libertarians with a valuable
opportunity to set a moral example and educate the public about our
values.</p>
