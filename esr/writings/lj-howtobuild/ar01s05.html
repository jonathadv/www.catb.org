We won't go into detail about this here
because the issues aren't at all specific to Linux -- you can find
good guidance in any DOS-related buyer's guide.  There's not a whole
lot of price variance among functionally equivalent monitors (it's a
mature commodity technology) so the basic question is &quot;how many
square inches of screen can you afford?&quot;.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This is one of the areas where pinching pennies is not a good idea.
You're going to be looking at your monitor for hours on end.  You are
going to be using the screen real estate constantly.  Buy the best
quality, largest screen you possibly can -- it will be worth it.  I
personally shelled out $2000 for a 21-inch monitor in January 1996.
Though I have no regular income and this represented a significant 
fraction of my bank account, I have never regretted it since.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The reasons not to pinch pennies are also reasons that you should
should actually see the monitor you're contemplating before you buy
it.  A factory flaw like serious edge misconvergence or a tilted yoke
is not a happy thing to discover just after you've cut a check.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">You may want to consider looking for a repaired or reconditioned
monitor with a warranty.  These are often as good as new, and much
cheaper.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Next, buy your card.  The major issue here is matching the
card to the capacity of your monitor -- you don't want to pay for more
card than your screen can use, and you don't want to buy too cheap a card
and find it can't drive your monitor at its maximum capability.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">So once you've specified your monitor, find a video card with a
maximum video bandwidth equal to or just slightly higher than the
monitor's.  That's how you know your video system is properly
balanced, with a minimum of wasted capacity.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is a fair amount of price variance among equivalent video cards,
so shop aggressively here.  If you're on a budget, one easy thing to
trade away is bit depth.  Manufacturers like to include 16- and 24-bit
&quot;photographic&quot; color as sizzle in their advertisements, but unless
you're doing something like specialty photocomposition work or medical
graphics you'll never use more than 256.  So you can settle for 8-bit
color.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The days when XFree86 seriously constrained your choice of video
card are long past.  Just about anything you can buy in a clone system
should work fine these days.  If you're in doubt about whether the
card is supported, surf over to <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://www.xfree86.org" target="_top">http://www.xfree86.org</a> and check
out their compatibility list.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s04.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s06.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top"> One Disk or Two? </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">  Easier Choices</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
