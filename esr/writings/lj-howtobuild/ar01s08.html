distribution channels for PCs were business-oriented storefront
dealerships and mail order.  The dealerships had (and still have) high
overheads and higher prices.  Accordingly, I recommended mail order.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I still like mail order, especially for techies on a tight budget.
Publications like &quot;Computer Shopper&quot; (and their web site at <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://www.netbuyer.com" target="_top">http://www.netbuyer.com</a>) are a
great way to get a feel for prices, and these days most mail-order
outfits with enough cash to advertise on glossy paper are good risks.
The online version of my <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/clone-hw-guide/contents.html" target="_top">Buyer's Guide</a> has
details on how to protect yourself when buying mail-order.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These days, though, I'm also a fan of computer superstores -- outfits
like CompUSA and Circuit City that sell hundreds of machines a day 
out of warehouse-sized premises packed to the ceiling with discounted
hardware.  These obviously have more overhead than mail-order outfits,
but their price premium over mail-order is small.  They make back a lot of
their margin on computer games and small accessories like mouse pads,
cables, and floppy disks.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">So if you shop carefully and don't fall for one of their
name-brand &quot;prestige&quot; systems, you can get prices comparable to mail
order with the comfort of knowing there's a trouble desk you can drive
back to in a pinch.  (Also, you <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">can</i></span> see your
monitor before you buy!)</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s07.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s09.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top"> Some Pitfalls To Avoid. </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> When To Buy</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
