syndrome.  (Also, try to find out if they do a power-cycling test and
how many repeats they do; this stresses the hardware much more than
steady burn-in.)</p></li><li xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">30 day money-back guarantee.  Watch out for fine print
that weakens this with a restocking fee or limits it with
exclusions.</p></li><li xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">1 year parts and labor guarantee (some vendors give 2
years).</p></li><li xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">1 year of 800 number tech support (many vendors give
lifetime support).</p></li></ul></div><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Additionally, many vendors offer a year of on-site service free.
You should find out who they contract the service to.  Also be sure
the free service coverage area includes your site; some unscrupulous
vendors weasel their way out with &quot;some locations pay extra&quot;, which
translates roughly as &quot;through the nose if you're further away than
our parking lot&quot;.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If you're buying from a dealership or superstore, find out what
they'll guarantee beyond the above.  If the answer is &quot;nothing&quot;, go
somewhere else.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ask your potential suppliers what kind and volume of documentation
they supply with your hardware.  You should get, at minimum,
operations manuals for the motherboard and each card or peripheral.
Skimpiness in this area is a valuable clue that they may be using
no-name parts from Upper Baluchistan, which is not necessarily a red
flag in itself but should prompt you to ask more questions.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are various cost-cutting tactics a vendor can use which
bring down the system's overall quality.  Here are some good questions
to ask:</p><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Is the memory zero-wait-state?  One or more wait
states allows the vendor to use slower and cheaper memory but will
slow down your actual memory subsystem throughput.  This is a
particularly important question for the cache
memory!</p></li><li xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If you're buying a factory-configured system, does it
have FCC certification?  While it's not necessarily the case that a
non-certified system is going to spew a lot of radio-frequency
interference, certification is legally required --- and becoming more
important as clock frequencies climb.  Lack of that FCC sticker may
indicate a fly-by-night vendor, or at least one in danger of being
raided and shut down!</p></li><li xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Are the internal cable connectors keyed, so they can't
be put in upside down?  This doesn't matter if you'll never, ever
<span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">ever</i></span> need to upgrade or service your system.
Otherwise, it's pretty important; and vendors who fluff this detail
may be quietly cutting other corners.</p></li></ul></div></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s10.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s12.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top"> The Recipe File </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">  After You Take Delivery</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
