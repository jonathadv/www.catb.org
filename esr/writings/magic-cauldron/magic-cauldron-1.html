<P>In Welsh myth, the goddess Ceridwen owned a great cauldron which would
magically produce nourishing food -- when commanded by a spell known
only to the goddess.  In modern science, Buckminster Fuller gave us
the concept of `ephemeralization', technology becoming both more
effective and less expensive as the physical resources invested in
early designs are replaced by more and more information content.
Arthur C. Clarke connected the two by observing that ``Any
sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic''.
<P>To many people, the successes of the open-source community seem like
an implausible form of magic.  High-quality software materializes
``for free'', which is nice while it lasts but hardly seems
sustainable in the real world of competition and scarce resources.
What's the catch?  Is Ceridwen's cauldron just a conjuring trick?  And
if not, how does ephemeralization work in this context -- what spell
is the goddess speaking?
<P>
