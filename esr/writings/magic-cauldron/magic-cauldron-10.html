<H2><A NAME="s10">10. When To Be Open, When To Be Closed</A></H2>

<P>Having reviewed business models that support open-source software
development, we can now approach the general question of when it makes 
economic sense to be open-source and when to be closed-source.  First, we
must be clear what the payoffs are from each strategy.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss10.1">10.1 What Are the Payoffs?</A>
</H2>

<P>The closed-source approach allows you to collect rent from your secret
bits; on the other hand, it forecloses the possibility of truly 
independent peer review.  The open-source approach sets up conditions
for independent peer review, but you don't get rent from your secret bits.
<P>The payoff from having secret bits is well understood; traditionally,
software business models have been constructed around it.  Until
recently, the payoff from independent peer review was not well
understood.  The Linux operating system, however, drives home a lesson
that we should probably have learned years ago from the history of the
Internet's core software and other branches of engineering -- that
open-source peer review is the only scalable method for achieving 
high reliability and quality.
<P>In a competitive market, therefore, customers seeking high reliability
and quality will reward software producers who go open-source and
discover how to maintain a revenue stream in the service, value-add,
and ancilliary markets associated with software.  This phenomenon is
what's behind the astonishing success of Linux, which came from
nowhere in 1996 to over 17% in the business server market by the end
of 1998 and seems on track to dominate that market within two years
(in early 1999 IDC projected that Linux would grow faster than all
other operating systems combined through 2003).
<P>An almost equally important payoff of open source is its utility as a
way to propagate open standards and build markets around them.  The
dramatic growth of the Internet owes much to the fact that nobody owns
TCP/IP; nobody has a proprietary lock on the core Internet protocols.
<P>The network effects behind TCP/IP's and Linux's success are fairly
clear and reduce ultimately to issues of trust and symmetry --
potential parties to a shared infrastructure can rationally trust it
more if they can see how it works all the way down, and will prefer an
infrastructure in which all parties have symmetrical rights to one in
which a single party is in a privileged position to extract rents or
exert control.
<P>It is not, however, actually necessary to assume network effects in
order for symmetry issues to be important to software consumers.  No
software consumer will rationally choose to lock itself into a
supplier-controlled monopoly by becoming dependent on closed source if
any open-source alternative of acceptable quality is available.  This
argument gains force as the software becomes more critical to the 
software consumer's business -- the more vital it is, the less the
consumer can tolerate having it controlled by an outside party.
<P>Finally, an important customer payoff of open-source software related
to the trust issue is that it's future-proof.  If sources are open,
the customer has some recourse if the vendor goes belly-up.  This may
be particularly important for widget frosting, since hardware tends to
have short life cycles, but the effect is more general and translates
into increased value for open-source software.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss10.2">10.2 How Do They Interact?</A>
</H2>

<P>When the rent from secret bits is higher than the return from open
source, it makes economic sense to be closed-source.  When the return
from open source is higher than the rent from secret bits, it makes 
sense to go open source.
<P>In itself, this is a trivial observation.  It becomes nontrivial when
we notice that the payoff from open source is harder to measure and
predict than the rent from secret bits -- and that said payoff is
grossly underestimated much more often than it is overestimated.
Indeed, until the mainstream business world began to rethink its
premises following the Mozilla source release in early 1998, the
open-source payoff was incorrectly but very generally assumed to be
zero.
<P>So how can we evaluate the payoff from open source?  It's a difficult
question in general, but we can approach it as we would any other
predictive problem.  We can start from observed cases where the
open-source approach has succeeded or failed.  We can try to
generalize to a model which gives at least a qualitative feel for
the contexts in which open source is a net win for the investor or
business trying to maximize returns.  We can then go back to the data
and try to refine the model.
<P>From the analysis presented in 
<A HREF="magic-cauldron-16.html#[CatB]">[CatB]</A>
, we can expect that
open source has a high payoff where (a)
reliability/stability/scalability are critical, and (b) correctness of
design and implementation is not readily verified by means other than
independent peer review.  (The second criterion is met in practice by
most non-trivial programs.)
<P>A consumer's rational desire to avoid being locked into a monopoly 
supplier will increase its interest in open source (and, hence, the
competitive-market value for suppliers of going open) as the software
becomes more critical to that consumer.  Thus, another criterion (c)
pushes towards open source when the software is a business-critical
capital good (as, for example, in many corporate MIS departments).
<P>As for application area, we observed above that open-source
infrastructure creates trust and symmetry effects that, over time,
will tend to attract more customers and to outcompete closed-source
infrastructure; and it is often better to have a smaller piece of such
a rapidly-expanding market than a bigger piece of a closed and
stagnant one.  Accordingly, for infrastructure software, an
open-source play for ubiquity is quite likely to have a higher
long-term payoff than a closed-source play for rent from intellectual
property.
<P>In fact, the ability of potential customers to reason about the future
consequences of vendor strategies and their reluctance to accept a
supplier monopoly implies a stronger constraint; without already
having overwhelming market power, you can choose either an open-source
ubiquity play or a direct-revenue-from-closed-source play -- but not
both.  (Analogues of this principle are visible elsewhere, e.g. in
electronics markets where customers often refuse to buy sole-source
designs.)  The case can be put less negatively: where network effects
(positive network externalities) dominate, open source is likely to be
the right thing.
<P>We may sum up this logic by observing that open source seems to be
most successful in generating greater returns than closed source in
software that (d) establishes or enables a common computing and
communications infrastructure.
<P>Finally, we may note that purveyors of unique or just highly
differentiated services have more incentive to fear copying of their
methods by competitors than do vendors of services for which the
critical algorithms and knowledge bases are well understood.
Accordingly, open source is more likely to dominate when (e)
key methods (or functional equivalents) are part of common engineering
knowledge.
<P>The Internet core software, Apache, and Linux's implementation of the
ANSI-standard Unix API are prime exemplars of all five criteria.  The
path towards open source in the evolution of such markets are
well-illustrated by the reconvergence of data networking on TCP/IP in
the mid-1990s following fifteen years of failed empire-building
attempts with closed protocols such as DECNET, XNS, IPX, and the like.
<P>On the other hand, open source seems to make the least sense for
companies that have unique possession of a value-generating software
technology (strongly fulfilling criterion (e)) which is (a) relatively
insensitive to failure, which can (b) readily be verified by means
other than independent peer review, which is not (c)
business-critical, and which would not have its value substantially
increased by (d) network effects or ubiquity.
<P>As an example of this extreme case, in early 1999 I was asked "Should
we go open source?"  by a company that writes software to calculate
cutting patterns for sawmills that want to extract the maximum yardage
of planks from logs.  My conclusion was ``No.''  The only criterion
this comes even close to fulfilling is (c); but at a pinch, an 
experienced operator could generate cut patterns by hand.
<P>An important point is that where a particular product or technology
sits on these scales may change over time, as we'll see in the
following case study.
<P>In summary, the following discriminators push towards open source:

<H2><A NAME="ss10.3">10.3 Doom: A Case Study</A>
</H2>

<P>The history of id software's best-selling game Doom illustrates ways
in which market pressure and product evolution can critically change
the payoff magnitudes for closed vs. open source.
<P>When Doom was first released in late 1993, its first-person, real-time
animation made it utterly unique (the antithesis of criterion (e)).
Not only was the visual impact of the technique stunning, but for many
months nobody could figure out how it had been achieved on the
underpowered microprocessors of that time.  These secret bits were
worth some very serious rent.  In addition, the potential payoff from
open source was low.  As a solo game, the software (a) incurred
tolerably low costs on failure, (b) not tremendously hard to verify,
(c) not business-critical for any consumer, (d) did not benefit from
network effects.  It was economically rational for Doom to be closed
source.
<P>However, the market around Doom did not stand still.  Would-be
competitors invented functional equivalents of its animation
techniques, and other ``first-person shooter'' games like Duke Nukem
began to appear.  As these games ate into Doom's market share the
value of the rent from secret bits went down.
<P>On the other hand, efforts to expand that share brought on new
technical challenges -- better reliability, more game features, a
larger user base, and multiple platforms.  With the advent of
multiplayer `deathmatch' play and Doom gaming services, the market
began to display substantial network effects.  All this was demanding
programmer-hours that id would have preferred to spend on the next
game.
<P>All of these trends raised the payoff from opening the source.  At
some point the payoff curves crossed over and it became economically
rational for id to open up the Doom source and shift to making
money in secondary markets such as game-scenario anthologies.  And
sometime after this point, it actually happened.  The full source for
Doom was released in late 1997. 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss10.4">10.4 Knowing When To Let Go</A>
</H2>

<P>Doom makes an interesting case study because it is neither an
operating system nor communications/networking software; it is thus
far removed from the usual and obvious examples of open-source
success.  Indeed, Doom's life cycle, complete with crossover point,
may be coming to typify that of applications software in today's code
ecology -- one in which communications and distributed computation
both create serious robustness/reliability/scalability problems only
addressible by peer review, and frequently cross boundaries both
between technical environments and between competing actors (with all
the trust and symmetry issues that implies).
<P>Doom evolved from solo to deathmatch play.  Increasingly, the network
effect <EM>is</EM> the computation.  Similar trends are visible even
in the heaviest business applications, such as ERPs, as businesses
network ever more intensively with suppliers and customers -- and, of
course, they are implicit in the whole architecture of the World Wide
Web.  It follows that almost everywhere, the open-source payoff is
steadily rising.
<P>If present trends continue, the central challenge of software
technology and product management in the next century will be knowing
when to let go -- when to allow closed code to pass into the
open-source infrastructure in order to exploit the peer-review effect
and capture higher returns in service and other secondary markets.
<P>There are obvious revenue incentives not to miss the crossover point
too far in either direction.  Beyond that, there's a serious
opportunity risk in waiting too long -- you could get scooped by
a competitor going open-source in the same market niche.
<P>The reason this is a serious issue is that both the pool of users and
the pool of talent available to be recruited into open-source
cooperation for any given product category is limited, and recruitment
tends to stick.  If two producers are the first and second to
open-source competing code of roughly equal function, the first is
likely to attract the most users and the most and best-motivated
co-developers; the second will have to take leavings.  Recruitment
tends to stick, as users gain familiarity and developers sink time
investments in the code itself.
