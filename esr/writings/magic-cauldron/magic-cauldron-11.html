<H2><A NAME="s11">11. The Business Ecology of Open Source</A></H2>

<P>The open-source community has organized itself in a way that tends to
amplify the productivity effects of open source.  In the Linux world,
in particular, it's an economically significant fact that there are
multiple competing Linux distributors which form a tier separate from
the developers.
<P>Developers write code, and make the code available over the Internet.
Each distributor selects some subset of the available code, integrates
and packages and brands it, and sells it to customers.  Users 
choose among distributions, and may supplement a distribution by
downloading code directly from developer sites.
<P>The effect of this tier separation is to create a very fluid internal
market for improvements. Developers compete with each other, for the
attention of distributors and users, on the quality of their software.
Distributors compete for user dollars on the appropriateness of their
selection policies, and on the value they can add to the software.
<P>A first-order effect of this internal market structure is that no
node in the net is indispensible.  Developers can drop out; even if their
portion of the code base is not picked up directly by some other
developer, the competition for attention will tend to rapidly generate
functional alternatives.  Distributors can fail without damaging or
compromising the common open-source code base.  The ecology as a whole
has a more rapid response to market demands, and more capability to
resist shocks and regenerate itself, than any monolithic vendor of a
closed-source operating system can possibly muster.
<P>Another important effect is to lower overhead and increase efficiency
through specialization.  Developers don't experience the pressures
that routinely compromise conventional closed projects and turn them
into tar-pits -- no lists of pointless and distracting check-list
features from Marketing, no management mandates to use inappropriate
and outdated languages or development environments, no requirement to
re-invent wheels in a new and incompatible way in the name of product
differentiation or intellectual-property protection, and (most
importantly) <EM>no deadlines</EM>.  No rushing a 1.0 out the door
before it's done right -- which (as DeMarco and Lister observed in
their discussion of the `wake me when it's over' management style in
<A HREF="magic-cauldron-16.html#[DL]">[DL]</A>
) generally conduces not only to higher quality but
actually to the most rapid delivery of a truly working result.
<P>Distributors, on the other hand, get to specialize in the things
distributors can do most effectively.  Freed of the need to fund
massive and ongoing software development just to stay competitive,
they can concentrate on system integration, packaging, quality 
assurance, and service.
<P>Both distributors and developers are kept honest by the constant
feedback from and monitoring by users that is an integral part of the
open-source method.
