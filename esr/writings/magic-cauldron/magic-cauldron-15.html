<H2><A NAME="s15">15. Conclusion: Life After The Revolution</A></H2>

<P>What will the world of software look like once the open-source
transition is complete?
<P>For purposes of examining this question, it will be helpful to
sort kinds of software by the degree of completeness which the service
they offer is describable by open technical standards, which is well
correlated with how commoditized the underlying service has become.
<P>This axis corresponds reasonably well to what people are normally
thinking when they speak of `applications' (not at all commoditized,
weak or nonexistent open technical standards), `infrastructure'
(commoditized services, strong standards), and `middleware' (partially
commoditized, effective but incomplete technical standards).  The
paradigm cases today in 1999 would be a word processor (application),
a TCP/IP stack (infrastructure), and a database engine (middleware).
<P>The payoff analysis we did earlier suggests that infrastructure,
applications, and middleware will be transformed in different ways and
exhibit different equilibrium mixes of open and closed source.  We
recall that it also suggested the prevalence of open source in a
particular software area would be a function of whether substantial
network effects operate there, what the costs of failure are, and to
what extent the software is a business-critical capital good.
<P>We can venture some predictions if we apply these heuristics not to
individual products but to entire segments of the software market.
Here we go:
<P>Infrastructure (the Internet, the Web, operating systems, and the
lower levels of communications software that has to cross boundaries
between competing parties) will be almost all open source,
cooperatively maintained by user consortia and by for-profit
distribution/service outfits with a role like that of Red Hat today.
<P>Applications, on the other hand, will have the most tendency to remain
closed.  There will be circumstances under which the use value of an
undisclosed algorithm or technology will be high enough (and the costs
associated with unreliability will be low enough, and the risks
associated with a supplier monopoly sufficiently tolerable) that
consumers will continue to pay for closed software.  This is likeliest
to remain true in standalone vertical-market applications where
network effects are weak.  Our lumber-mill example earlier is one
such; biometric identification software seems likeliest, of 1999's hot
prospects, to be another.
<P>Middleware (like databases, development tools, or the customized top
ends of application protocol stacks) will be more mixed.  Whether
middleware categories tend to go closed or open seems likely to depend
on the cost of failures, with higher cost creating market pressure for
more openness.
<P>To complete the picture, however, we need to notice that neither
`applications' nor `middleware' are really stable categories.  In
`Knowing When To Let Go' above we saw that individual software
technologies seem to go through a natural life cycle from rationally
closed to rationally open.  The same logic applies in the large.
<P>Applications tend to fall into middleware as standardized techniques
develop and portions of the service becomes commoditized.  (Databases,
for example, became middleware after SQL decoupled front ends from
engines.)  As middleware services become commoditized, they will in
turn tend to fall into the open-source infrastructure -- a transition 
we're seeing in operating systems right now.
<P>In a future that includes competition from open source, we can expect
that the eventual destiny of any software technology will be to either
die or become part of the open infrastructure itself.  While this is
hardly happy news for entrepreneurs who would like to collect rent on
closed software forever, it does suggest that the software industry as
a whole will <EM>remain</EM> entrepreneurial, with new niches
constantly opening up at the upper (application) end and a limited
lifespan for closed-IP monopolies as their product categories fall
into infrastructure.
<P>Finally, of course, this equilibrium will be great for the software
consumer driving the process.  More and more high-quality software
will become permanently available to use and build on instead of being
discontinued or locked in somebody's vault.  Ceridwen's magic cauldron
is, finally, too weak a metaphor -- because food is consumed or
decays, whereas software sources potentially last forever. The free
market, in its widest libertarian sense including <EM>all</EM>
un-coerced activity whether trade or gift, can produce perpetually
increasing software wealth for everyone.
