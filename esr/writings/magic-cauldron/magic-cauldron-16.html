Shawn Hargreaves has written a good analysis of the applicability of
open-source methods to games; 
<A HREF="http://www.talula.demon.co.uk/games.html">Playing the Open Source Game</A>.
<P>Several stimulating discussions with David D. Friedman helped me
refine the `inverse commons' model of open-source cooperation.  I am
also indebted to Marshall van Alstyne for pointing out the conceptual
importance of rivalrous information goods.  Ray Ontko of the Indiana
Group supplied helpful criticism.  A good many people in audiences
before whom I gave talks in the year leading up to June 1999 also
helped; if you're one of those, you know who you are.
<P>It's yet another testimony to the open-source model that this paper
was substantially improved by email feedback I received within days
after release.  Lloyd Wood pointed out the importance of open-source
software being `future-proof'. and Doug Dante reminded me of the `Free
the Future' business model.  A question from Adam Moorhouse led to the
discussion of exclusion payoffs.  Lionel Oliviera Gresse gave me a
better name for one of the business models.  Stephen Turnbull slapped
me silly about careless handling of free-rider effects.
