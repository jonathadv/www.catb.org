<P>The experience of the open-source culture has certainly confounded
many of the assumptions of people who learned about software
development outside it.  ``The Cathedral and the Bazaar'' 
<A HREF="magic-cauldron-16.html#[CatB]">[CatB]</A>
 described the ways in which decentralized cooperative
software development effectively overturns Brooks's Law, leading to
unprecedented levels of reliability and quality on individual
projects.  ``Homesteading the Noosphere'' 
<A HREF="magic-cauldron-16.html#[HtN]">[HtN]</A>
 examined
the social dynamics within which this `bazaar' style of development is
situated, arguing that it is most effectively understood not in
conventional exchange-economy terms but as what anthropologists call a
`gift culture' in which members compete for status by giving things
away.  In this paper we shall begin by exploding some common myths
about software production economics; then continue the analysis of
<A HREF="magic-cauldron-16.html#[CatB]">[CatB]</A>
 and 
<A HREF="magic-cauldron-16.html#[HtN]">[HtN]</A>
 into the realm of economics,
game theory and business models, developing new conceptual tools
needed to understand the way that the gift culture of open-source
developers can sustain itself in an exchange economy.
<P>In order to pursue this line of analysis without distraction, we'll
need to abandon (or at least agree to temporarily ignore) the `gift
culture' level of explanation. 
<A HREF="magic-cauldron-16.html#[HtN]">[HtN]</A>
 posited that gift
culture behavior arises in situations where survival goods are
abundant enough to make the exchange game no longer very interesting;
but while this appears sufficiently powerful as a
<EM>psychological</EM> explanation of behavior, it lacks suffiency as
an explanation of the mixed <EM>economic</EM> context in which most
open-source developers actually operate.  For most, the exchange game
has lost its appeal but not its power to constrain.  Their behavior
has to make sufficient material-scarcity-economics sense to keep them
in a gift-culture-supporting zone of surplus.
<P>Therefore, we now will consider (from entirely <EM>within</EM> the
realm of scarcity economics) the modes of cooperation and exchange
that sustain open-source development.  While doing so we will answer
the pragmatic question ``How do I make money at this?'', in detail and
with examples.  First, though, we will show that much of the tension
behind that question derives from prevailing folk models of
software-production economics that are false to fact.
<P>(A final note before the exposition: the discussion and advocacy of
open-source development in this paper should not be construed as a
case that closed-source development is intrinsically wrong, nor as a
brief against intellectual-property rights in software, nor as an
altruistic appeal to `share'.  While these arguments are still beloved
of a vocal minority in the open-source development community,
experience since 
<A HREF="magic-cauldron-16.html#[CatB]">[CatB]</A>
 has made it clear that they are
unnecessary.  An entirely sufficient case for open-source development
rests on its engineering and economic outcomes -- better quality,
higher reliability, lower costs, and increased choice.)
