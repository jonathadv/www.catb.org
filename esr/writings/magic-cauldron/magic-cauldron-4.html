<H2><A NAME="s4">4. The ``information wants to be free'' Myth</A></H2>

<P>There is another myth, equal and opposite to the factory-model
delusion, which often confuses peoples' thinking about the economics of
open-source software.  It is that ``information wants to be free''.
This usually unpacks to a claim that the zero marginal cost of
reproducing digital information implies that its clearing price ought
to be zero.
<P>The most general form of this myth is readily exploded by considering
the value of information that constitutes a claim on a rivalrous good
-- a treasure map, say, or a Swiss bank account number, or a claim on
services such as a computer account password.  Even though the
claiming information can be duplicated at zero cost, the item being
claimed cannot be.  Hence, the non-zero marginal cost for the item can
be inherited by the claiming information.
<P>We mention this myth mainly to assert that it is unrelated to the
economic-utility arguments for open source; as we'll see later, those
would generally hold up well even under the assumption that software
actually <EM>does</EM> have the (nonzero) value structure of a
manufactured good.  We therefore have no need to tackle the question
of whether software `should' be free or not.
<P>
