<H2><A NAME="s5">5. The Inverse Commons</A></H2>

<P>Having cast a skeptical eye on one prevailing model, let's see if we
can build another -- a hard-nosed economic explanation of what makes
open-source cooperation sustainable.
<P>This is a question that bears examination on a couple of different
levels.  On one level, we need to explain the behavior of individuals who
contribute to open-source projects; on another, we need to understand
the economic forces that sustain cooperation on open-source projects like
Linux or Apache.
<P>Again, we must first demolish a widespread folk model that interferes
with understanding.  Over every attempt to explain cooperative 
behavior there looms the shadow of Garret Hardin's Tragedy of the
Commons.
<P>Hardin famously asks us to imagine a green held in common by a village
of peasants, who graze their cattle there.  But grazing degrades the
commons, tearing up grass and leaving muddy patches, which re-grow
their cover only slowly.  If there is no agreed-on (and enforced!)
policy to allocate grazing rights that prevents overgrazing, all
parties' incentives push them to run as many cattle as quickly as
possible, trying to extract maximum value before the commons degrades
into a sea of mud.
<P>Most people have an intuitive model of cooperative behavior that goes
much like this.  It's not actually a good diagnosis of the
economic problems of open-source, which are free-rider
(underprovision) rather than congested-public-good (overuse).
Nevertheless, it is the analogy I hear behind most off-the-cuff
objections.
<P>The tragedy of the commons predicts only three possible outcomes.  One
is the sea of mud.  Another is for some actor with coercive power to
enforce an allocation policy on behalf of the village (the communist
solution).  The third is for the commons to break up as village
members fence off bits they can defend and manage sustainably (the
property-rights solution).
<P>When people reflexively apply this model to open-source cooperation,
they expect it to be unstable with a short half-life.  Since there's
no obvious way to enforce an allocation policy for programmer time
over the internet, this model leads straight to a prediction that the
commons will break up, with various bits of software being taken
closed-source and a rapidly decreasing amount of work being fed back
into the communal pool.
<P>In fact, it is empirically clear that the trend is opposite to this.
The breadth and volume of open-source development (as measured by, for
example, submissions per day at Metalab or announcements per day at
freshmeat.net) is steadily increasing.  Clearly there is some critical
way in which the ``Tragedy of the Commons'' model fails to capture
what is actually going on.
<P>Part of the answer certainly lies in the fact that using software does
not decrease its value.  Indeed, widespread use of open-source
software tends to <EM>increase</EM> its value, as users fold in their
own fixes and features (code patches).  In this inverse commons, the
grass grows taller when it's grazed on.
<P>Another part of the answer lies in the fact that the putative market
value of small patches to a common source base is hard to capture.
Supposing I write a fix for an irritating bug, and suppose many people
realize the fix has money value; how do I collect from all those
people?  Conventional payment systems have high enough overheads to
make this a real problem for the sorts of micropayments that would
usually be appropriate.
<P>It may be more to the point that this value is not merely hard to
capture, in the general case it's hard to even <EM>assign</EM>.  
As a thought experiment let us suppose that the Internet came 
equipped with the theoretically ideal micropayment system -- secure,
universally accessible, zero-overhead.  Now let's say you have written a
patch labeled ``Miscellaneous Fixes to the Linux Kernel''.  How do you
know what price to ask?  How would a potential buyer, not having seen
the patch yet, know what is reasonable to pay for it?
<P>What we have here is almost like a funhouse-mirror image of
F.A. Hayek's `calculation problem' -- it would take a superbeing, both
able to evaluate the functional worth of patches and trusted to set
prices accordingly, to lubricate trade.
<P>Unfortunately, there's a serious superbeing shortage, so patch author
J. Random Hacker is left with two choices: sit on the patch, or throw
it into the pool for free.  The first choice gains nothing.  The
second choice may gain nothing, or it may encourage reciprocal giving
from others that will address some of J. Random's problems in the
future.  The second choice, apparently altruistic, is actually
optimally selfish in a game-theoretic sense.
<P>In analyzing this kind of cooperation, it is important to note that
while there is a free-rider problem (work may be underprovided in the
absence of money or money-equivalent compensation) it is not one
that scales with the number of end-users.  The complexity and
communications overhead of an open-source project is almost entirely a
function of the number of developers involved; having more end-users
who never look at source costs effectively nothing.  It may increase
the rate of silly questions appearing on the project mailing lists,
but this is relatively easily forestalled by maintaining a Frequently
Asked Questions list and blithely ignoring questioners who have
obviously not read it (and in fact both these practices are typical).
<P>The real free-rider problems in open-source software are more a
function of friction costs in submitting patches than anything else.
A potential contributor with little stake in the cultural reputation
game (see 
<A HREF="magic-cauldron-16.html#[HtN]">[HtN]</A>
) may, in the absence of money compensation,
think ``It's not worth submitting this fix because I'll have to clean
up the patch, write a ChangeLog entry, and sign the FSF assignment
papers...''.  It's for this reason that the number of contributors
(and, at second order, the success of) projects is strongly and
inversely correlated with the number of hoops each project makes a
user go through to contribute.  Such friction costs may be political
as well as mechanical. Together they may explain why the loose,
amorphous Linux culture has attracted orders of magnitude more
cooperative energy than the more tightly organized and centralized BSD
efforts and why the Free Software Foundation has receded in relative
importance as Linux has risen.
<P>This is all good as far as it goes.  But it is an after-the-fact
explanation of what J. Random Hacker does with his patch after he has
it. The other half we need is an economic explanation of how JRH was
able to write that patch in the first place, rather than having to
work on a closed-source program that might have returned him sale
value.  What business models create niches in which open-source
development can flourish?
