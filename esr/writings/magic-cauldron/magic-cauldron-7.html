<H2><A NAME="s7">7. Use-Value Funding Models</A></H2>

<P>A key fact that the distinction between use and sale value allows us
to notice is that only <EM>sale value</EM> is threatened by the shift
from closed to open source; use value is not.
<P>If use value rather than sale value is really the major driver of
software development, and (as was argued in 
<A HREF="magic-cauldron-16.html#[CatB]">[CatB]</A>
)
open-source development is really more effective and efficient than
closed, then we should expect to find circumstances in which expected
use value alone sustainably funds open-source development.
<P>And in fact it is not difficult to identify at least two important
models in which full-time developer salaries for open-source projects
are funded strictly out of use value.  
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1 The Apache case: cost-sharing</A>
</H2>

<P>Let's say you work for a firm that has a business-critical requirement
for a high-volume, high-reliability web server.  Maybe it's for
electronic commerce, maybe you're a high-visibility media outlet
selling advertising, maybe you're a portal site.  You need 24/7
uptime, you need speed, and you need customizability.
<P>How are you going to get these things?  There are three basic
strategies you can pursue:
<P><EM>Buy a proprietary webserver.</EM> In this case, you are
betting that the vendor's agenda matches yours and that the vendor
has the technical competence to implement properly.  Even assuming
both these things to be true, the product is likely to come up short
in customizability; you will only be able to modify it through the
hooks the vendor has chosen to provide.  This proprietary-webserver
path is not a popular one.
<P><EM>Roll your own.</EM> Building your own webserver is not an
option to dismiss instantly; webservers are not very complex,
certainly less so than browsers, and a specialized one can be very
lean and mean.  Going this path, you can get the exact features and
customizability you want, though you'll pay for it in development
time.  Your firm may also find it has a problem when you retire or
leave.
<P><EM>Join the Apache group.</EM> The Apache server was built by an
Internet-connected group of webmasters who realized that it was
smarter to pool their efforts into improving one code base than to run
a large number of parallel development efforts.  By doing this they
were able to capture both most of the advantages of roll-your-own and
the powerful debugging effect of massively-parallel peer review.
<P>The advantage of the Apache choice is very strong. Just how strong, we
may judge from the monthly Netcraft survey, which has shown Apache
steadily gaining market share against all proprietary webservers since
its inception.  As of June 1999, Apache and its derivatives have
<A HREF="http://www.netcraft.com/survey/">61% market share</A> --
with no legal owner, no promotion, and no contracted service
organization behind them at all.
<P>The Apache story generalizes to a model in which software users find
it to their advantage to fund open-source development because doing so
gets them a better product than they could otherwise have, at lower cost.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.2">7.2 The Cisco case: risk-spreading</A>
</H2>

<P>Some years ago, two programmers at Cisco (the networking-equipment
manufacturer) got assigned the job of writing a distributed
print-spooling system for use on Cisco's corporate network.  This
was quite a challenge.  Besides supporting the ability for arbitrary
user A to print at arbitrary printer B (which might be in the next
room or a thousand miles away), the system had to make sure that in
the event of a paper-out or toner-low condition the job would get
rerouted to an alternate printer near the target.  The system  also needed
to be able to report such problems to a printer administrator.
<P>The duo came up with a clever set of modifications to the standard
Unix print-spooler software, plus some wrapper scripts, that did the
job.  Then they realized that they, and Cisco, had a problem.
<P>The problem was that neither of them was likely to be at Cisco
forever.  Eventually, both programmers would be gone, and the software
would be unmaintained and begin to rot (that is, to gradually fall out
of sync with real-world conditions).  No developer likes to see this
happen to his or her work, and the intrepid duo felt Cisco had paid
for a solution under the not unreasonable expectation that it would
outlast their own jobs there.
<P>Accordingly, they went to their manager and urged him to authorize the
release of the print spooler software as open source.  Their argument
was that Cisco would have no sale value to lose, and much else to
gain.  By encouraging the growth of a community of users and
co-developers spread across many corporations, Cisco could effectively
hedge against the loss of the software's original developers.
<P>The Cisco story generalizes to a model in which open source functions
not so much to lower costs as to spread risk.  All parties find that
the openness of the source, and the presence of a collaborative
community funded by multiple independent revenue streams, provides
a fail-safe that is itself economically valuable -- sufficiently
valuable to drive funding for it.
