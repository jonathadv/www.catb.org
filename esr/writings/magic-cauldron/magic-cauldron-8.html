<H2><A NAME="s8">8. Why Sale Value is Problematic</A></H2>

<P>Open source makes it rather difficult to capture direct sale value
from software.  The difficulty is not technical; source code is no
more nor less copyable than binaries, and the enforcement of copyright
and license laws permitting capture of sale value would not by necessity
be any more difficult for open-source products than it is for closed.
<P>The difficulty lies rather with the nature of the social contract that
supports open-source development.  For three mutually reinforcing
reasons, the major open-source licenses prohibit most of the sort of
restrictions on use, redistribution and modification that would
facilitate direct-sale revenue capture.  To understand these reasons.
we must examine the social context within which the licenses evolved;
the Internet 
<A HREF="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html">hacker</A> culture.  
<P>Despite myths about the hacker culture still (in 1999) widely believed
outside it, none of these reasons has to do with hostility to the
market.  While a minority of hackers does indeed remain hostile to the
profit motive, the general willingness of the community to cooperate
with for-profit Linux packagers like Red Hat, SUSE, and Caldera
demonstrates that most hackers will happily work with the corporate
world when it serves their ends.  The real reasons hackers frown on
direct-revenue-capture licenses are more subtle and interesting.
<P>One reason has to do with symmetry.  While most open-source developers
do not intrinsically object to others profiting from their gifts, most
also demand that no party (with the possible exception of the
originator of a piece of code) be in a <EM>privileged</EM> position to
extract profits.  J. Random Hacker is willing for Fubarco to profit by
selling his software or patches, but only so long as JRH himself could
also potentially do so.
<P>Another has to do with unintended consequences.  Hackers have observed
that licenses that include restrictions on and fees for `commercial'
use or sale (the most common form of attempt to recapture direct sale
value, and not at first blush an unreasonable one) have serious
chilling effects.  A specific one is to cast a legal shadow on
activities like redistribution in inexpensive CD-ROM anthologies,
which we would ideally like to encourage.  More generally,
restrictions on use/sale/modification/distribution (and other
complications in licensing) exact an overhead for conformance tracking
and (as the number of packages people deal with rises) a combinatorial
explosion of perceived uncertainty and potential legal risk.  This outcome
is considered harmful, and there is therefore strong social pressure
to keep licenses simple and free of restrictions.
<P>The final and most critical reason has to do with preserving the
peer-review, gift-culture dynamic described in 
<A HREF="magic-cauldron-16.html#[HtN]">[HtN]</A>
.
License restrictions designed to protect intellectual property or
capture direct sale value often have the effect of making it legally
impossible to fork the project (this is the case, for example, with
Sun's so-called "Community Source" licenses for Jini and Java).  While
forking is frowned upon and considered a last resort (for reasons
discussed at length in 
<A HREF="magic-cauldron-16.html#[HtN]">[HtN]</A>
), it's considered critically
important that that last resort be present in case of maintainer
incompetence or defection (e.g. to a more closed license).
<P>The hacker community has some give on the symmetry reason; thus, it
tolerates licenses like Netscape's NPL that give some profit
privileges to the originators of the code (specifically in the NPL
case, the exclusive right to use the open-source Mozilla code in
derivative products including closed source).  It has less give on
the unintended-consequences reason, and none on preserving the
option to fork (which is why Sun's Java and Jini `Community License'
schemes have been largely rejected by the community).
<P>These reasons explain the clauses of the Open Source Definition, which
was written to express the consensus of the hacker community about the
critical features of the standard licenses (the GPL, the BSD license,
the MIT License, and the Artistic License).  These clauses have the
effect (though not the intention) of making direct sale value very 
hard to capture.
