<H2><A NAME="s9">9. Indirect Sale-Value Models</A></H2>

<P>Nevertheless, there are ways to make markets in software-related
services that capture something like indirect sale value.  There
are five known and two speculative models of this kind (more may
be developed in the future).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.1">9.1 Loss-Leader/Market Positioner</A>
</H2>

<P>In this model, you use open-source software to create or maintain a
market position for proprietary software that generates a direct
revenue stream.  In the most common variant, open-source client
software enables sales of server software, or subscription/advertising 
revenue associated with a portal site.
<P>Netscape Communications, Inc. was pursuing this strategy when it
open-sourced the Mozilla browser in early 1998.  The browser side of
their business was at 13% of revenues and dropping when Microsoft
first shipped Internet Explorer.  Intensive marketing of IE (and shady
bundling practices that would later become the central issue of an
antitrust lawsuit) quickly ate into Netscape's browser market share,
creating concern that Microsoft intended to monopolize the browser
market and then use de-facto control of HTML to drive Netscape out of
the server market.
<P>By open-sourcing the still-widely-popular Netscape browser, Netscape
effectively denied Microsoft the possibility of a browser monopoly.
They expected that open-source collaboration would accelerate the
development and debugging of the browser, and hoped that Microsoft's IE
would be reduced to playing catch-up and prevented from exclusively
defining HTML.
<P>This strategy worked.  In November 1998 Netscape actually began to
regain business-market share from IE.  By the time Netscape was
acquired by AOL in early 1999, the competitive advantage of
keeping Mozilla in play was sufficiently clear that one of AOL's first
public commitments was to continue supporting the Mozilla project,
even though it was still in alpha stage.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.2">9.2 Widget Frosting</A>
</H2>

<P>This model is for hardware manufacturers (hardware, in this context,
includes anything from Ethernet or other peripheral boards all the way
up to entire computer systems).  Market pressures have forced hardware
companies to write and maintain software (from device drivers through
configuration tools all the way up to the level of entire operating
systems), but the software itself is not a profit center.  It's an
overhead -- often a substantial one.
<P>In this situation, opening source is a no-brainer.  There's no revenue
stream to lose, so there's no downside.  What the vendor gains is a
dramatically larger developer pool, more rapid and flexible response
to customer needs, and better reliability through peer review.  It
gets ports to other environments for free. It probably also gains
increased customer loyalty as its customers' technical staffs put
increasing amounts of time into the code to do the customizations they
require.
<P>There are a couple of vendor objections commonly raised specifically
to open-sourcing hardware drivers.  Rather than mix them with
discussion of more general issues here, I have written an 
<A HREF="magic-cauldron-17.html#drivers">appendix</A> specifically on this topic.
<P>The `future-proofing' effect of open source is particularly strong
with respect to widget frosting.  Hardware products have a finite
production and support lifetime; after that, the customers are on
their own.  But if they have access to driver source and can patch
them as needed, they're more likely to be happier repeat customers of
the same company.
<P>A very dramatic example of adopting the widget frosting model was
Apple Computer's decision in mid-March 1999 to open-source "Darwin",
the core of their MacOSX server operating system.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.3">9.3 Give Away the Recipe, Open A Restaurant</A>
</H2>

<P>In this model, one open-sources software to create a market position
not for closed software (as in the Loss-Leader/Market-Positioner case)
but for services. 
<P>(I used to call this `Give Away the Razor, Sell Razor Blades', The
coupling is not really as tight as the razor/razor-blade analogy
implies.)
<P>This is what Red Hat and other Linux distributors do.  What they are
actually selling is not the software, the bits itself, but the value
added by assembling and testing a running operating system that is
warranted (if only implicitly) to be merchantable and to be
plug-compatible with other operating systems carrying the same brand.
Other elements of their value proposition include free installation
support and the provision of options for continuing support contracts.
<P>The market-building effect of open source can be extremely powerful,
especially for companies which are inevitably in a service position
to begin with.  One very instructive recent case is Digital
Creations, a website-design house started up in 1998 that specializes
in complex database and transaction sites.  Their major tool, the
intellectual-property crown jewels of the company, is an object
publisher that has been through several names and incarnations but
is now called Zope.
<P>When the Digital Creations people went looking for venture capital,
the VC they brought in carefully evaluated their prospective market 
niche, their people, and their tools.  He then recommended that
Digital Creations take Zope to open source.
<P>By traditional software-industry standards, this looks like an
absolutely crazy move.  Conventional business-school wisdom has it
that core intellectual property like Zope is a company's crown jewels,
never under any circumstances to be given away.  But the VC had two
related insights.  One is that Zope's true core asset is actually the
brains and skills of its people.  The second is that Zope is likely
to generate more value as a market-builder than as a secret tool.
<P>To see this, compare two scenarios.  In the conventional one, Zope
remains Digital Creations's secret weapon.  Let's stipulate that it's
a very effective one.  As a result, the firm will able to deliver
superior quality on short schedules -- <EM>but nobody knows that</EM>.
It will be easy to satisfy customers, but harder to build a customer
base to begin with.
<P>The VC, instead, saw that open-sourcing Zope could be critical
advertising for Digital Creations's <EM>real</EM> asset -- its people.
He expected that customers evaluating Zope would consider it more
efficient to hire the experts than to develop in-house Zope expertise.
<P>One of the Zope principals has since confirmed very publicly that
their open-source strategy has "opened many doors we wouldn't have got
in otherwise".  Potential customers do indeed respond to the logic of
the situation -- and Digital Creations, accordingly, is prospering.
<P>Another up-to-the-minute example is 
<A HREF="http://www.e-smith.net/">e-smith, inc.</A>. This company sells support contracts for
turnkey Internet server software that is open-source, a customized
Linux.  One of the principals, describing the spread of free downloads
of e-smith's software, 
<A HREF="http://www.globetechnology.com/gam/News/19990625/BAND.html">says</A>
``Most companies would consider that software piracy; we consider it
free marketing''.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.4">9.4 Accessorizing</A>
</H2>

<P>In this model, you sell accessories for open-source software.  At the
low end, mugs and T-shirts; at the high end, professionally-edited and
produced documentation.  
<P>O'Reilly Associates, publishers of many excellent references volumes
on open-source software, is a good example of an accessorizing
company.  O'Reilly actually hires and supports well-known open-source
hackers (such as Larry Wall and Brian Behlendorf) as a way of building
its reputation in its chosen market.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.5">9.5 Free the Future, Sell the Present</A>
</H2>

<P>In this model, you release software in binaries and source with a
closed license, but one that includes an expiration date on the
closure provisions.  For example, you might write a license that
permits free redistribution, forbids commercial use without fee, and
guarantees that the software come under GPL terms a year after
release or if the vendor folds.
<P>Under this model, customers can ensure that the product is
customizable to their needs, because they have the source.  The
product is future-proofed -- the license guarantees that an open
source community can take over the product if the original company
dies.
<P>Because the sale price and volume are based on these customer
expectations, the original company should enjoy enhanced revenues from
its product versus releasing it with an exclusively closed source
license.  Furthermore, as older code is GPLed, it will get serious peer
review, bug fixes, and minor features, which removes some of the 75%
maintainance burden on the originator.
<P>This model has been successfully pursued by Aladdin Enterprises,
makers of the popular Ghostscript program (a PostScript interpreter
that can translate to the native languages of many printers).  
<P>The main drawback of this model is that the closure provisions tend
to inhibit peer review and participation early in the product cycle,
precisely when they are needed most.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.6">9.6 Free the Software, Sell the Brand</A>
</H2>

<P>This is a speculative business model.  You open-source a software 
technology, retain a test suite or set of compatibility criteria,
then sell users a brand certifying that their implementation of
the technology is compatible with all others wearing the brand.
<P>(This is how Sun Microsystems ought to be handling Java and Jini.)
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.7">9.7 Free the Software, Sell the Content</A>
</H2>

<P>This is another speculative business model.  Imagine something like a
stock-ticker subscription service.  The value is neither in the client
software nor the server but in providing objectively reliable
information.  So you open-source all the software and sell
subscriptions to the content.  As hackers port the client to new
platforms and enhance it in various ways, your market automatically
expands.
<P>(This is why AOL ought to open-source its client software.)
