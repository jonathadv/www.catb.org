<h1 class="c1">The Nerligig Papers</h1>

<p>I have read Sharon Lee and Steve Miller's Liaden series of space
operas with enjoyment ever since the first one, "Agent of Change",
came out in 1988. At a couple of points in them there are
references to a device of obscure function called a "nerligig".</p>

<p>None of these references actually tell us what a nerligig
<em>does</em>, which I found an entertaining tease. I though the
joke was worth extending, so I wrote Steve asking for the collected
references so I could work up a routine maintainance checklist for
nerligigs in the same spirit.</p>

<h1>The canonical references</h1>

<p>Here are the collected references to nerligigs, kindly forwarded
to me by Steve Miller.</p>

<p>1988 Miller, Steve &amp; Sharon Lee <cite>Conflict of
Honors</cite> ISBN 0-345-35353-6: Page 116: "I," the captain said,
"would rather get my hands dirty setting up the nerligig." ...
"emerged with a toolbox in one hand and a dark nerligig in the
other." ... "put the nerligig on his knees."</p>

<p>Page 117: "But his head was bent over the mechanism, and he was
to all appearances absorbed in making the necessary
adjustments"</p>

<p>1999 Lee,Sharon &amp; Steve Miller <cite>Duty Bound</cite> SRM,
Publisher:</p>

<p>Page 41: "I'm here to fix your nerligig," the little man told
the morning guy behind the bar.' "Ist broke?" the bartender
wondered. The device sat in its place, motionless ... The repairman
shook his head, set up his tools, adroitly removed the wachmalog
and the bornduggle from the nerligig, and waited patiently for the
boss. ... It was the boss who saw the nerligig guy, professionally
polishing one of the inner gimbag joints.</p>

<p>Page 46 "There's a small package I disconnected and took out of
the nerligig..."</p>

<h1>The checklist</h1>

<p>Step 1. Remove the cover with a standard type B clip tool.</p>

<p>Step 2: Check the indicator on the attractant reservoirs, as
they may need to be refilled. To refill them, it will be necessary
to lift out the port manifold.</p>

<p>Step 3. Look for discoloration around the emission ports. This
may indicate corrosion. If the ports are significantly discolored,
replace the port manifold.</p>

<p>Step 4: Check for play or seizure in the gimbag joints. The
linkage to the rotor platform is a likely trouble spot.</p>

<p>Step 5: Clean and lubricate the gimbag joints. Note: be sure to
use graphite rather than petrochemical-based lubricants, as oil is
too easily degraded by secondary radiation from the wachamalog.</p>

<p>Step 6. Recalibrate the optical-frequency converters on the
bornduggle. Frequency drift is especially likely in the short
wavelengths.</p>

<p>Step 7: Over long periods the emission fibers have a tendency to
outgas and become brittle. If they feel stiff or inelastic under
light finger pressure, replace the fiber bundles.</p>

<p>Step 8: Run the controller block's self-test. Replace on
failure.</p>

<p>Step 9: Run the controller block's system test for the first
time. Listen for hiss, distortion, or flutter in the syrinx
reference tones. Do <em>not</em> look at the emission stage during
this test. As replacing the syrinx is not a field procedure, you
will need to return the unit to a repair depot if this subsystem
has problems.</p>

<p>Step 10: Run the controller block's system test for the second
time with the syrinx disabled. The rotor platform should turn
smoothly and the emitter luminance levels should be constant.</p>

<p>Step 11: Replace the cover.</p>

<p>Step 12: Polish the dome using a non-abrasive cleanser.</p>

<p>Oh, so you haven't figured out what a nerligig does yet? If you
like a bit of mystery in your universe, stop here. Otherwise <a
