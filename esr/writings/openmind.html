<p>The advent of the Internet is driving some drastic changes in
the software industry. We usually think of dramatically lower
communications and transaction costs as the Internet's major value
(and challenge!). That's the noisy, well-hyped part of the Internet
revolution.</p>

<p>But there's something else going on, as well. The Internet's
engineering tradition, its native culture, and even its folklore
are turning out to hold lessons that are going to be critical for
the creativity-and software-intensive economy of the coming
century.</p>

<p>The shot heard 'round the world in this quieter revolution was
the source release of Netscape's `Mozilla' browser at midnight of
April Fool's Day, 1998. This brought to widespread press and public
attention a face-off between two dramatically different and
fundamentally opposed styles of software development &mdash; a
confrontation that had been building for thirty years, but became
inevitable after the the advent of the World Wide Web and the
popular Internet explosion of 1993-94.</p>

<p>One of these styles is what we've now learned to call `closed
source' &mdash; the traditional factory-production model of proprietary
software, in which the customer gets a sealed block of bits which
cannot be examined, modified, or evolved. The standard-bearer of
this approach is Microsoft.</p>

<p>The other is `open source', the Internet engineering tradition,
in which source code is generally available for inspection,
independent peer review and rapid evolution. The standard-bearer of
this approach is the Linux operating system.</p>

<p>The now-notorious <a
href="http://www.opensource.org/halloween/">Halloween Documents</a>
ratified in Microsoft's own words what has become increasingly
clear in the last nine months &mdash; that the open-source model is well
on its way to obsolescing the closed-source one. But to understand
why, and to think clearly about what this means for the future, we
need to step back from the particularities of Microsoft and Linux
and consider some qualitative, general issues about three things:
reliability, total cost of ownership, and software risks.</p>

<p>Historically, the way we get high reliability of results in
engineering and the sciences is by institutionalizing peer review.
Physicists don't hide their experimental plans from each other;
instead, they skeptically check each others' work. Engineers don't
build dams or suspension bridges without having the blueprints
vetted first by other engineers independent of the original design
group.</p>

<p>In the software industry, our reliability has historically been
terrible. Crashes, hangs, and lost data are still commonplace.
Also, we don't as a rule do peer review. You might think these
facts are unconnected, until you look at the infrastructure of the
Internet. All of the Internet's core software is open-source &mdash; and
its reliability is extremely good. This is an even stronger
demonstration because the Internet is multi-platform, heterogenous,
international, and has remained essentially backward-compatible
through thirty years and several generations of technology.</p>

<p>The pattern is simple and compelling. Where we have open-source
software, we have peer review and high reliability. Where we don't,
reliability suffers terribly. This fact in itself is probably
sufficient to marginalize closed-source development in the
future.</p>

<p>Total cost of ownership is also drastically affected by open
source. In a closed-source world, the software producer can charge
for the bits and has an effective monopoly lock on service.
Accordingly, major closed-source packages cost thousands of dollars
up front and thousands of dollars a year in continuing service and
upgrade costs.</p>

<p>In the open-source world, the bits are free and the provider
doesn't have a lock on your service and upgrade business.
Accordingly, both up-front and annual service/support costs are
low. Quite shockingly and threateningly low, by Microsoft's
standards.</p>

<p>The indirect effect of open-source on total cost of ownership is
even stronger. Cash-strapped educational institutions love
inexpensive software; they love open-source software especially,
because it lets students examine and experiment in ways extremely
valuable for learning. Universities and technical schools are now
beginning to turn out an increasing flood of Linux-aware graduates,
each one far more knowledgeable about the operating system than any
MCSE can possibly be about closed-source Windows. The potential
impact of this on personnel and training costs should not be hard
to imagine.</p>

<p>But the most important long-term effect of open source will be
on software risks. To see why, we need to focus again on the
supplier-monopoly aspect of closed source. Let's say you're a CTO
at a Fortune 500 company and you've just spent millions of dollars
on strategic business system with software you can't see inside,
can't modify, and depend on a single vendor to service.</p>

<p>Now...are those systems going to change to serve <em>your</em>
business plan &mdash; or your <em>vendor's</em> business plan?</p>

<p>When being locked into an unhealthy dependency on your vendor
was the only alternative anybody could see, it was hard to evaluate
closed source as a risk. But open-source software puts the software
consumer back in control of his destiny. It creates a
<em>buyer's</em> market for enhancements, service, and support; it
allows a mix of options including in-house development or
contracting to any one of multiple competing service groups.</p>

<p>To be concrete: if your OS is Windows, Microsoft is the only
choice you have &mdash; you're locked in, trapped. If it's Linux, Red
Hat has to do its service job well or watch its business go to
Caldera or S.u.S.E. And if Red Hat and Caldera and S.u.S.E fail,
ten thousand Internet developers will cheerfully launch new
distributions using the same free, common, exhaustively debugged
code base.</p>

<p>We've seen that open source puts the software customer in the
driver's seat, dramatically lowers total cost of ownership, and is
the only recipe that works for high reliability. For these good
reasons, it probably won't be long before buying closed-source
software for any system that must be truly reliable is considered
outright irresponsible.</p>

<p>Yes, after the quiet revolution you could be fired for buying
Microsoft &mdash; and, if you keep it up, maybe you should be.</p>
