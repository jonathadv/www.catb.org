<h1 class="c1">The Biology of Promiscuity</h1>

<p>Why do human beings screw around when it complicates our lives
so much? Why do we preach fidelity at each other and then, so
often, practice adultery? The cheap and obvious answer, "because it
feels too good to stop" isn't a good one, as it turns out.</p>

<p>Evolutionary biology teaches us that humans being, like other
animals, are adaptive machines; "feels good" is simply instinct's
way to steer us towards behaviors that were on average successful
for our ancestors. So that answer simply sets up another question:
why has our species history favored behavior that is (as the agony
columns, bitter ballads, tragic plays and veneral-disease
statistics inform us) often destructive to all parties
involved?</p>

<p>This question has extra point for humans because human sex and
childbirth are risky business compared to that of most of our near
relatives. Human infants have huge heads, enough to make giving
birth a chancy matter -- and even so, the period during which they
remain dependent on nurturing is astonishingly long and requires a
lot of parental investment.</p>

<p>If we were redesigning humans to cope with the high investment
requirement, one obvious way would be to rewire our instincts such
that we pair-bond exclusively for life. It's certainly possible to
imagine an evolved variant of humanity in which "infidelity" is
never an issue because mated pairs imprint on each other so
specifically that nobody else is sexually interesting. Some birds
are like this. So why aren't <em>we</em> like this? Why haven't
promiscuity and adultery been selected out? What adaptive function
do they serve that balances out the risk to offspring from unstable
matings?</p>

<p>The route to an answer lies in remembering that evolutionary
selection is not a benign planner that tries to maximize group
survival but rather a blind competition between individual genetic
lines. We need to look more closely at the conflicting strategies
used by competing players in the reproduction game.</p>

<p>Male promiscuity has always been relatively easy to understand.
While total parental investment needs to be pretty intense, men
have a dramatically lower <em>minimum</em> energy and risk
investment in children than women do; one index of the difference
is that women not infrequently died in childbirth under pre-modern
conditions. This means genetic lines propagating through us hairy
male types have an optimum strategy that tilts us a little more
towards "have lots of offspring and don't nurture much", while
women tilt towards "have few offspring, work hard at making sure
they survive to breed".</p>

<p>This also explains why cultures that have not developed an
explicit ideology of sexual equality invariably take female
adultery much more seriously than male adultery. A man who fails to
take a grave view of his mate's "unfaithfulness" is risking a much
larger fraction of his reproductive potential than a woman who
ignores her husband's philandering.</p>

<p>Indeed, there is a sense in which a man who is always "faithful"
is under-serving his genes -- and the behavioral tendency to do
that will be selected <em>against</em>. His optimal strategy is to
be promiscuous enough to pick up opportunities to have his
reproductive freight partly paid by other men, while not being so
"faithless" that potential mates will consider him a bad risk (e.g.
for running off with another woman and abandoning the kids).</p>

<p>What nobody had a good theory for until the mid-1990s was why
women cooperate in this behavior. Early sociobiological models of
human sexual strategy predicted that women should grab the best
provider they could attract and then bend heaven and earth to keep
him faithful, because if he screwed around some of his effort would
be likely to be directed towards providing for children by other
women. In these theories, female abstinence before marriage and
fidelity during it was modeled as a trade offered men to keep them
faithful in turn; an easy trade, because nobody had noticed any
evolutionary incentives for women to cheat on the contract.</p>

<p>In retrospect, the resemblence of the female behavior predicted
by these models to conventional moral prescriptions should have
raised suspicions about the models themselves -- because they
failed to predict the actual pervasiveness of female promiscuity
and adultery even in <em>observable</em> behavior, let alone
concealed.</p>

<p>Start with a simple one: If the trade-your-fidelity-for-his
strategy were really a selective optimum, singles bars wouldn't
exist, because genotypes producing women with singles-bar behavior
would have been selected out long ago. But there's an even bigger
whammy...</p>

<p>Actual paternity/maternity-marker studies in urban populations
done under guarantees that one's spouse and others won't see the
results have found that the percentage of adulterous children born
to married women with ready access to other men can be startlingly
high, often in the 25% to 45% range. In most cases, the father has
no idea and the mother, in the nature of things, was unsure before
the assay.</p>

<p>These statistics cry out for explanation -- and it turns out
women do have an evolutionary incentive to screw around. The light
began to dawn during studies of chimpanzee populations. Female
chimps who spurn low-status bachelor males from their own band are
much more willing to have sex with low-status bachelor males from
<em>other</em> bands.</p>

<p>That turned out to be the critical clue. There may be other
incentives we don't understand, but it turns out that women
genetically "want" both to keep an alpha male faithful and to
<em>capture maximum genetic variation in their offspring</em>.
Maximum genetic variation increases the chance that some offspring
will survive the vicissitudes of rapidly-changing environmental
stresses, of which a notably important one is co-evolving parasites
and pathogens.</p>

<p>Assume Jane can keep Tarzan around and raise four children. Her
best strategy isn't to have all four by Tarzan -- it's to have
three by Tarzan and one by some romantic stranger, a bachelor male
from another pack. As long as Tarzan doesn't catch them at it, the
genes conditioning Jane's sexual strategy get 50% of the
reproductive payoff regardless of who the biological father is. If
the stranger is a fitter male than the best mate she could keep
faithful, so much the better. Her kids will win.</p>

<p>And this isn't just a human strategy either. Similar behavior
has been observed in other species with high parental investment,
notably among birds.</p>

<p>So. The variation effect predicts that mated women should have a
fairly strong genetic incentive to sneak off into the bushes with
romantic strangers -- that is, other men who are (a) from outside
their local breeding population, and (b) are physically attractive
or talented or intelligent, or (c) show other, socially-mediated
signs of high fitness (such as wealth or fame).</p>

<p>It may also explain why polyamorism is only now emerging as a
social movement, <em>after</em> women's liberation, and why its
most energetic partisans tend to be women. Our instincts don't know
about contraceptive intervention; from our genes' point of view
sexual access is equivalent to reproductive use. As our instincts
see it, polyamory (the ideology of open marriage) enables married
women to have children with bachelor males without risking losing
their husband's providership for any children. Men gain less from
the change, because they trade away a claim on exclusive use of
their wives' scarce reproductive capacity for what may be only a
marginal increase in access to other women (relative to the
traditional system combining closed marriage and high rates of
covert adultery).</p>

<p>This model may not please prudes and Victorians very much, but
at least it explains <em>her</em> cheatin' heart as well as
his.</p>
