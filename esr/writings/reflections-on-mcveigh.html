<p class='notebox'>Written May 16 2001; later revised to add the name
of the North Vietnamese village where one of the atrocities
occurred.  A <a
href="http://www.computerra.ru/online/firstpage/10353/">Russian</a>
translation is available.)</p>

<br />

<p>On April 19th, 1995, a fertilizer bomb blew up the Alfred P.
Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. By the time the
dust settled, 168 people &mdash; 19 of them children &mdash; were dead.</p>

<p>Within weeks, a decorated veteran of the Gulf War named Timothy
McVeigh had been arrested. After being convicted of the act, he
defiantly justified it as retaliation for the U.S. government's
actions at Waco and Ruby Ridge. In a famously chilling quote, he
described the deaths of all those women and children as "collateral
damage".</p>

<p>This week, five years after the event and a mere week before
McVeigh was scheduled to die by lethal injection (the first person
to be executed in a Federal prison since 1963), we learned that a
major FBI bungle in evidence handling may save his life. He might
even go free on a mistrial.</p>

<p>This news has triggered a media frenzy. This morning, I looked
at a Newsweek cover on which McVeigh's face had been solarized into
a demonic, glowing mask. The cover was no more portentious than its
content &mdash; an earnest, almost plaintive inquiry into the nature of
evil. The article itself is actually rather interesting &mdash; it
suggests that there may be consistent neurological deficits of the
prefontal lobes, anterior cingulate gyrus and left temporal region
behind murderously sociopathic behavior.</p>

<p>Similar exercises are being repeated all across the national
media. And yet, as I read them, I sense a peculiar, determined
evasiveness about them. There's a rush going on to demonize McVeigh
as a nearly unique vessel of radical evil, a man whose acts were
(like Stalin's or Hitler's) so far beyond the pale of normal human
behavior that the only possible explanation is a deep pathology of
the brain or of less tangible elements of the self.</p>

<p>This seems to me like a way to avoid facing the really hard
questions. Questions which begin with this one: where and when and
how did Timothy McVeigh learn to think of taking the lives of
innocent women and children as acceptable "collateral damage"?</p>

<p>Of course we know the answer to that one. McVeigh learned that
term in the U.S. military. He learned it while faithfully serving
the U.S. government's military and political objectives. In pursuit
of those objectives hundreds (possibly thousands) of Iraqis women
and children died in the bombings of Baghdad and elsewhere. They
were "collateral damage".</p>

<p>In writing about the Nuremberg trials after World War II, Hannah
Arendt coined the phrase "the banality of evil". She was
encapsulating the utter ordinariness of the men who carried out
Hitler's orders for the Final Solution, the attempted extinction of
the Jews in Europe. It seems that we have not yet learned the
lesson Nuremberg was teaching.</p>

<p>The Holocaust, and the Oklahoma City bombing, should frighten us
not because the killers were beyond the pale, but precisely because
they were <em>not</em> &mdash; their `radical evil' was in fact
difficult to distinguish from similar behaviors that have been (and
are still) considered necessary to society and honored rather than
despised.</p>

<p>I think Senator Bob Kerrey understands this very well. Recently
he admitted that in 1969 the Navy SEAL team on which he served shot
up the North Vietnamese hamlet of Thanh Pong while on an
assassination mission against a Viet Cong leader. Dozens of
defenseless women and children died. Collateral damage.</p>

<p>If history had turned out differently, would Kerrey have
belonged in the dock of a war-crimes trial? Kerrey himself seems to
be unsure. He says he is not fit to be President. He is probably
right. But he has supporters eager to exonerate him from all across
the political spectrum.</p>

<p>Timothy McVeigh was no Ted Bundy, no simple psychopath dicing up
victims at random. He timed the bombing for the anniversary of the
Waco massacre, in which U.S. Government agents used tanks, teargas,
and munitions known to have incendiary side-effects against
civilians on U.S. soil. During the attack, 27 children were gassed
to death in a bunker. Collateral damage.</p>

<p>If Timothy McVeigh says he was motivated by a sense of moral
outrage and duty to his country, why is it that we rush to dismiss
him as a psychopathic embodiment of evil while Bob Kerrey and the
FBI agents at Waco are treated as moral actors?</p>

<p>Note that in asking this question I am <em>not</em> arguing that
the Oklahoma City bombing was &lsquo;right&rsquo; or that Kerrey's
actions or those of the agents at Waco were &lsquo;wrong&rsquo;. I am
trying to point out that we don't have any grounds to declare McVeigh
insane or evil that he doesn't share with others of whose actions we
approve.</p>

<p>The theory that Kerrey and the Waco agents were within the pale
because they were following the orders of a legitimately
constituted government won't wash. The Nuremberg trials, if they
settled anything at all, settled that "I was just following orders"
is <em>not</em> an excuse for slaughtering the defenseless.</p>

<p>More generally, that McVeigh reported acting from individual
radical political conviction doesn't solve the problem either.
History has not infrequently judged violent revolutionaries to have
been in the right. Our own country was founded by violent
revolutionaries who took up the gun only after they felt (as
McVeigh says he did) that peaceful avenues of redress had been
exhausted.</p>

<p>History may yet judge the U.S. government's actions at Waco and
Ruby Ridge and in Vietnam more harshly than McVeigh's; we don't
know that yet, and cannot now know it. In any case, declaring
McVeigh a psychopath either because of or in spite of the fact that
he justified his killings with anti-government rhetoric seems to me
uncomfortably close to the old Soviet tactic of defining dissidents
as insane.</p>

<p>The real questions Timothy McVeigh poses, the ones I think we
are all trying to duck by demonizing him, is the same one that the
Nuremberg trials implicitly raised but never answered. Is the
killing of innocents as "collateral damage" inflicted in pursuit of
a political end <em>ever</em> justified?</p>

<p>If we answer "no", then we have to start asking hard questions
about Bob Kerrey's SEAL team, and about the agents who killed at
Waco &mdash; and about the Gulf War in which McVeigh, killing Iraqis for
his country, earned a medal. Most Americans today aren't prepared
to take that pacifist a line.</p>

<p>But if we answer "yes", we have to start asking even harder
questions about where we draw the line. How do we distinguish between
the state-sanctioned killings of innocents at Waco and Ruby Ridge, the
&lsquo;terrorism&rsquo; of Timothy McVeigh, and the revolutionary
violence of the U.S.'s Founding Fathers?</p>

<p>If we reject the pacifist "no", is there any standard more
principled than "winners write the history books"? <em>That</em> is
the final and most troubling question the unrepentant McVeigh
raises, and the one that the media frenzy of analysis is evading.
Perhaps because, deep down, we know we have no good answers.</p>

<p>And it's not an academic question, because if history is any
guide Timothy McVeigh won't be the last of his kind. What can we
teach our honorable men, our war heroes, our Kerreys and McVeighs,
that will keep them from becoming what we judge to be monsters?</p>

<p>The murdered children of Waco, Ruby Ridge, Oklahoma City and
Thanh Pong demand an answer.</p>
