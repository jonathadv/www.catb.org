<p class='notebox'>I wrote this in immediate response to an article in the
October 1999 First Monday. It has been translated into <a
href="http://www1.neweb.ne.jp/wa/yamdas/column/technique/responsej.html">
Japanese</a>.</p>
<br />

<p>Over the last eighteen months, dozens of people have written
thoughtful critiques of <a href="cathedral-bazaar/">The Cathedral and
the Bazaar</a> (CatB) and its sequels, <a
href="homesteading/">Homesteading the Noosphere</a> (HtN) and <a
href="magic-cauldron">The Magic Cauldron</a> (tMC). I welcome such
criticism; in many cases (as you can see in the change histories
attached to these papers) I have incorporated elements of them into
later versions.</p>

<p>Nikolai Bezroukov's <a
href="http://www.firstmonday.dk/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/696">
article in First Monday</a>, unfortunately, adds almost nothing
useful to the debate. Instead, Mr. Bezroukov has constructed a
straw man he calls <q>vulgar Raymondism</q> which bears so little
resemblance to the actual content of my writings and talks that I
have to question whether he has actually studied the work he is
attacking. If <q>vulgar Raymondism</q> existed, I would be its harshest
critic.</p>

<p>I wanted to like this paper. I wanted to learn from it. But I
began to realize this was unlikely when, three paragraphs in, I
tripped over the following: <em><q>he promoted an overoptimistic and
simplistic view of open source, as a variant of socialist (or, to
be more exact, vulgar Marxist) interpretation of software
development.</q></em></p>

<p>There are many sins of which I can reasonably be accused, but
the imputation of <q>vulgar Marxism</q> won't stand up to even a casual
reading of my papers. In CatB, I analogize open-source development
to a free market in Adam Smith's sense and use the terminology of
classical (capitalist) economics to describe it. In HtN I advance
an argument for the biological groundedness of property rights and
cite Ayn Rand approvingly on the dangers of altruism. And the
entire body of tMC develops the thesis that open-source development
and the post-industrial capitalism of the Information Age are
natural allies.</p>

<p>In fact, I find the imputation of Marxism deeply and personally
offensive as well as untrue. While I have made a point of not
gratuitously waving my politics around in my papers, it is no
secret in the open-source world that I am a libertarian, a friend
of the free market, and implacably hostile to all forms of Marxism
and socialism (which I regard as coequal in evil with Naziism).</p>

<p>Mr. Bezroukov then proposes an analogy between open-source
development and the practices of the scientific community as though
it is something I have culpably overlooked. Apparently he somehow
missed the fact that two sections of HtN are largely devoted to
exploring this connection and suggesting sociopsychological reasons
for it.</p>

<p>Gross and peculiar distortions of my analyses follow. Here are a
few of Mr. Bezroukov's more obviously false readings of my
work:</p>

<blockquote><em>Open source is a completely new progressive
phenomenon (bright future of mankind) with no analogs in
history.</em></blockquote>

<p>Somehow Mr. Bezroukov's has missed, or ignored, those sections
of CatB which explicitly relate the Linux bazaar mode of
development back to Gerald Weinberg's <q>egoless programming</q> and
earlier open-source communities including the MIT AI lab and
Berkeley. He has also failed to address those portion of HtN in
which I relate open-source development to the history of
experimental science and engineering, or the section of tMC in
which I suggest an analogy between current developments in
open-source world and the preindustrial system of aristocratic
patronage for the arts.</p>

<blockquote><em>All open source projects are the same and employ
the so-called "bazaar model".</em></blockquote>

<p>In CatB itself, I criticize the Free Software Foundation for
<em>not</em> applying the bazaar model to its free software/open
source projects.</p>

<blockquote><em>Microsoft need [sic] to be
destroyed.</em></blockquote>

<p>Neither CatB nor any other of my papers ever makes this claim,
even by implication. I grepped them and reread to check.</p>

<p>While I have made no secret of my detestation of certain of
Microsoft's business practices, I have publicly (a) refused to
cooperate with the D.O.J lawsuit on grounds of free-market
principle, (b) repeatedly exhorted open-source developers that we
need to be <em>for</em> software quality, not just <em>against</em>
something, and (c) given my talk to a mostly friendly audience at
Microsoft!</p>

<blockquote><em>The open source movement consist of ideal
cooperative people.</em></blockquote>

<p>How Mr. Bezroukov reconciles this reading of my work with all
the material in HtN on conflict resolution is hard for me to
understand. The <q>ideal cooperative people</q> he supposes me to
believe in would not need conflict-resolution mechanisms because
they would have no conflicts.</p>

<p>All these howlers take place in the first 10% of the paper. Most
of the remaining 90%, despite Mr. Bezroukov's billing of it as
<cite>Critique of Vulgar Raymondism</cite>, doesn't address or refute my work
at all. It is hard to avoid the suspicion that Mr. Bezroukov has
glued an artificial controversy with me onto the front of his paper
in order to attract attention to work that would otherwise have
little to recommend it. It is no credit to the referees of First
Monday that they apparently fell for this trick.</p>

<p>I tried hard to draw something of value from this paper, as I
have from many critiques in the past. But the parts of it that are
not tendentious nonsense largely repeat observations that other
people (including Jamie Zawinski, Alan Cox, Andrew Leonard, and
myself) have made better and sooner. I am irresistibly moved to
quote Edgar Allan Poe at Mr. Bezroukov. <q>Your work is both true and
original. Unfortunately, the parts that are true are not original,
and the parts that are original are not true.</q></p>
