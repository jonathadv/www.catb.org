<p>The history of modern SF is one of five attempted revolutions
&mdash; one success and four enriching failures.  I'm going to offer
you a look at them from an unusual angle, a political one.  This turns
out to be useful perspective because more of the history of SF than
one might expect is intertwined with political questions, and SF had
an important role in giving birth to at least one distinct political
ideology that is alive and important today.</p>

<p>The first and greatest of the revolutions came out of the minds of
John Wood Campbell and Robert Heinlein, the editor and the author who
invented modern science fiction.  The pivotal year was 1937, when John
Campbell took over the editorship of <cite>Astounding Science
Fiction</cite>.  He published Robert Heinlein's first story a little
over a year later.</p>

<p>Pre-Campbellian science fiction had bubbled up from the American pulp
magazines of the 1910s and 1920s, inspired by pioneers like Jules
Verne and H.G. Wells and promoted by the indefatigable Hugo Gernsback 
(who had a better claim than anyone else to have invented the genre 
as a genre, and consequently got SF's equivalent of the Oscar named
after him).  Early "scientifiction" mostly recycled an endless series of
cardboard cliches: mad scientists, lost races, menacing bug-eyed
monsters, coruscating death rays, and screaming blondes in brass
underwear.  With a very few exceptions (like E.E. "Doc" Smith's
<cite>Skylark of Space</cite> and sequels) the stuff was teeth-jarringly
bad; unless you have a specialist interest in the history of the
genre I don't recommend seeking it out.</p>

<p>John Campbell had been one of the leading writers of space opera
from 1930, second only to E.E. "Doc" Smith in inventiveness.  When he
took over <cite>Astounding</cite>, he did so with a vision: one that
demanded higher standards of both scientific plausibility and
story-crafting skill than the field had ever seen before.  He
discovered and trained a group of young writers who would dominate the
field for most of the next fifty years.  Robert Heinlein, Isaac
Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke, Poul Anderson, and Hal Clement were among
them.</p>

<p>Heinlein was the first of Campbell's discoveries and, in the end,
the greatest.  It was Heinlein who introduced into SF the technique of
description by indirection &mdash; the art of describing his future
worlds not through lumps of exposition but by presenting it through
the eyes of his characters, subtly leading the reader to fill in by
deduction large swathes of background that a lesser author would have
drawn in detail.</p>

<p>(Many accounts have it that Heinlein <em>invented</em> SFnal
exposition by indirection, but credit for that innovation may be due
to none other than Rudyard Kipling, whose 1912 story <cite>With The
Night Mail</cite> anticipated the style and expository mechanics of
Campbellian hard science fiction fourteen years before Hugo
Gernsback's invention of the "scientifiction" genre and twenty-seven
years before Heinlein's first publication.  Heinlein professed high
regard for Kipling all his life and included tributes to Kipling in
several of his works; it is possible, even probable, that he saw 
himself as Kipling's literary successor.)</p>

<p>From World War II into the 1950s Campbell's writers &mdash; many
working scientists and engineers who knew leading-edge technology from
the inside &mdash; created the Golden Age of science fiction.  Other
SF pulpzines competing with <cite>Astounding</cite> raised their 
standards and new ones were founded.  The field took the form of
an extended conversation, a kind of proto-futurology worked out
through stories that often implicitly commented on each other.</p>

<p>While space operas and easy adventure stories continued to be
written, the center of the Campbellian revolution was "hard SF", a
form that made particularly stringent demands on both author and
reader.  Hard SF demanded that the science be consistent both
internally and with known science about the real world, permitting
only a bare minimum of McGuffins like faster-than-light star drives.
Hard SF stories could be, and were, mercilessly slammed because the
author had calculated an orbit or gotten a detail of physics or
biology wrong.  Readers, on the other hand, needed to be
scientifically literate to appreciate the full beauty of what the
authors were doing.</p>

<p>There was also a political aura that went with the hard-SF style, one
exemplified by Campbell and right-hand man Robert Heinlein.  That
tradition was of ornery and insistant individualism, veneration of the
competent man, an instinctive distrust of coercive social engineering
and a rock-ribbed empiricism that that valued knowing how things work
and treated all political ideologizing with suspicion.  Exceptions 
like Asimov's <cite>Foundation</cite> novels only threw the implicit
politics of most other Campbellian SF into sharper relief.</p>

<p>At the time, this very American position was generally thought of
by both allies and opponents as a conservative or right-wing one.  But
the SF community's version was never conservative in the strict sense
of venerating past social norms &mdash; how could it be, when SF
literature cheerfully contemplated radical changes in social
arrangements and even human nature itself?  SF's insistent
individualism also led it to reject racism and feature strong female
characters decades before the rise of political correctness ritualized
these behaviors in other forms of art.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, some writers found the confines of the field too
narrow, or rejected Campbellian orthodoxy for other reasons.  The
first revolt against hard SF came in the early 1950s from a group of
young writers centered around Frederik Pohl and the Futurians fan club
in New York.  The Futurians invented a kind of SF in which science was
not at the center, and the transformative change motivating the story
was not technological but political or social.  Much of their output
was sharply satirical in tone, and tended to de-emphasize individual
heroism.  The Futurian masterpiece was the Frederik Pohl/Cyril
Kornbluth collaboration <cite>The Space Merchants</cite> (1956).</p>

<p>The Futurian revolt was political as well as aesthetic.  Not until
the late 1970s did any the participants admit that many of the key
Futurians had histories as ideological Communists or fellow
travellers, and that fact remained relatively unknown in the field well
into the 1990s.  As with later revolts against the Campbellian tradition,
part of the motivation was a desire to escape the "conservative"
politics that went with that tradition.  While the Futurians' work was
well understood at the time to be a poke at the consumer capitalism
and smugness of the postwar years, only in retrospect is it clear how
much they owed to the Frankfurt school of Marxist critical theory.</p>

<p>But the Futurian revolt was half-hearted, semi-covert, and easily
absorbed by the Campbellian mainstream of the SF field; by the
mid-1960s, sociological extrapolation had become a standard part of
the toolkit even for the old-school Golden Agers, and it never
challenged the centrality of hard SF.  The Futurians' Marxist
underpinnings lay buried and undiscussed for decades after the
fact.</p>

<p>Perception of Campbellian SF as a "right-wing" phenomenon lingered,
however, and helped motivate the next revolt in the mid-1960s, around
the time I started reading the stuff.  The field was in bad shape
then, though I lacked the perspective to see so at the time.  The
death of the pulp-zines in the 1950s had pretty much killed off the SF
short-fiction market, and the post-Star-Wars boom that would make SF
the second most successful fiction genre after romances was still a
decade in the future.</p>

<p>The early Golden Agers were hitting the thirty-year mark in their
writing careers, and although some would find a second wind in later
decades many were beginning to get a bit stale.  Heinlein reached his
peak as a writer with 1967's <cite>The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress</cite>
and, plagued by health problems, began a long decline.</p>

<p>These objective problems combined with, or perhaps led to, an
insurgency within the field &mdash; the "New Wave", an attempt to
import the techniques and imagery of literary fiction into SF.  As
with that of the Futurians, the New Wave was both a stylistic revolt
and a political one.</p>

<p>The New Wave's inventors (notably Michael Moorcock,
J.G. Ballard and Brian Aldiss) were British socialists and Marxists
who rejected individualism, linear exposition, happy endings,
scientific rigor and the U.S.'s cultural hegemony over the SF field in
one fell swoop.  The New Wave's later American exponents were strongly
associated with the New Left and opposition to the Vietnam War,
leading to some rancorous public disputes in which politics was
tangled together with definitional questions about the nature of SF
and the direction of the field.</p>

<p>But the New Wave, after 1965, was not so easily dismissed or
assimilated as the Futurians had been.  Amidst a great deal of
self-indulgent crap and drug-fueled psychedelizing, there shone a few
jewels &mdash; Brian Aldiss's <cite>Hothouse</cite> stories (1961,
retrospectively recruited into the post-1965 New Wave by their
author) Langdon Jones's <cite>The Great Clock</cite> (1966),
Phillip Jos&eacute; Farmer's <cite>Riders of the Purple Wage</cite>
(1967), Harlan Ellison's <cite>I Have No Mouth And I Must
Scream</cite> (1967), and Fritz Leiber's <cite>One Station of the
Way</cite> (1968) stand out as examples.</p>

<p>As with the Futurians, the larger SF field rapidly absorbed some
New Wave techniques and concerns.  Notably, the New Wavers broke the
SF taboo on writing about sex in any but the most cryptically coded
ways, a stricture previously so rigid that only Heinlein himself had
had the stature to really break it, in <cite>Stranger In A
Strange Land</cite> (1961) &mdash; a book that helped shape the hippie 
counterculture of the later 1960s.</p>

<p>But the New Wave also exacerbated long-standing critical arguments
about the nature of science fiction itself, and briefly
threatened to displace hard SF from the center of the field.  Brian
Aldiss's 1969 dismissal of space exploration as "an old-fashioned
diversion conducted with infertile phallic symbols" was typical New
Wave rhetoric, and looked like it might have some legs at the
time.</p>

<p>As a politico-cultural revolt against the American vision of SF,
however, the New Wave eventually failed just as completely as the
Futurians had.  Its writers were already running out of steam in 1977
when <cite>Star Wars</cite>, rather obviously patterned on Edmond
Hamilton's <cite>The Star Kings</cite> (1949), took the imagery of
pre-Campbellian space opera to the mainstream culture.  The
half-decade following (my college years, as it happened) was a period
of drift and confusion only ended by the publication of David Brin's
<cite>Startide Rising</cite> in 1982.</p>

<p>Brin, and his colleagues in the group that came to be known as the
"Killer Bs" (Greg Bear and Gregory Benford), reasserted the primacy of
hard SF done in the grand Campbellian manner. Campbell himself had
died in 1971 right at the high-water mark of the New Wave, but
Heinlein and Anderson and the other surviving luminaries of the
Campbellian era had no trouble recognizing their inheritors.  To
everyone's surprise, the New Old Wave proved to be not just
artistically successful but commercially popular as as well, with its
writers becoming the first new stars of the post-1980 boom in SF
publishing.</p>

<p>Before getting back to the Killer Bs and their Campbellian
revival, I need to point out an important bit of background.
Besides helping spawn the New Wave, the Vietnam War broke open
a long-standing fissure in the "right" wing of American politics.
One kind of right-winger was the cultural conservative, frequently
with both religious and militarist beliefs.  The other kind was
the "classical-liberal" or small-government conservative.  These
two very different tendencies had been forced into alliance in
both the U.S. and Great Britain by the rise of the socialist Left
after 1910.</p>

<p>The aftermath of Barry Goldwater's failed presidential campaign in
1964 had strained the alliance between these factions almost to the
breaking point.  The Vietnam War broke it, at least for some.  A mixed
group of dissident classical liberals and anti-war radicals formed the
Libertarian Party in 1971, repudiating both the right's cultural 
conservatism and the left's redistributionist statism.</p>

<p>This is worth noticing in a history of SF because the platform of
the Libertarian Party read like a reinvented, radicalized and
intellectualized form of the implicit politics of Campbellian hard SF.
This was not a coincidence; many of the founding Libertarians were
science-fiction fans.  They drew inspiration not merely from the
polemical political science fiction of Ayn Rand &mdash; <cite>The
Fountainhead</cite> (1943); <cite>Atlas Shrugged</cite> (1957) &mdash;
but from the entire canon of Campbellian SF.</p>

<p>Something rather similar had happened in the late 19th century,
when Edward Bellamy's <cite>Looking Backward From The Year 2000</cite> (1887)
and various other works of utopian fiction now forgotten had helped shape
the thinking of early Socialists.  But this time the connection was
more two-way and intimate; novels like Heinlein's <cite>The Moon Is A
Harsh Mistress</cite> (1967), H. Beam Piper's <cite>Lone Star
Planet</cite> (1958, originally as <cite>A Planet For Texans</cite>),
and Poul Anderson's <cite>No Truce With Kings</cite> (1963), among
many others, came to be seen retrospectively as proto-libertarian
arguments not just by their readers but, often, by the authors of the
novels themselves.</p>

<p>The new hard SF of the 1980s returned to Golden Age themes and
images, if not quite with the linear simplicity of Golden Age
technique.  It also reverted to the anti-political/individualist
values traditional in the field.  This time around, with explicit
libertarianism a feature of the political landscape, the split between
order-worshiping conservatism and the individualist impulse was more
marked.  At one extreme, some SF (such as that of L. Neil Smith)
assumed the character of radical libertarian propaganda.  At the other
extreme, a subgenre of SF that could fairly be described as
conservative/militarist power fantasies emerged, notably in the
writing of Jerry Pournelle and David Drake.</p>

<p>Tension between these groups sometimes flared into public
animosity.  Both laid claims to Robert Heinlein's legacy.  Heinlein
himself (increasingly erratic as a writer but still the Grand Old Man
of the field, immensely respected by fans and even more by other
authors) maintained friendly relationships with conservatives but
described himself as a libertarian for more than a decade before his
death in 1988.<p>

<p>Symbolically, Heinlein was the first among equals in a study
commission of SF authors formed by Ronald Reagan to consider the
feasibility of an anti-ballistic missile defense.  Commission member
Gregory Benford later described President Reagan as "a science fiction
fan", and the vision that emerged as the Strategic Defense Initiative
was startlingly SFnal.  Reagan's threat to build SDI at the Reykjavik
summit with Gorbachev in 1986 triggered the collapse of Soviet
strategic ambitions as Mikhail Gorbachev realized that the Soviet
Union could not match the U.S.'s raise in the geopolitical poker game.
The Berlin Wall fell three years later and the Soviet Union collapsed
three years after that; science fiction saved the world.  Somewhere,
Campbell and Heinlein were probably smiling.</p>

<p>Heinlein's personal evolution from New Deal left-liberal to
Goldwater conservative to anti-statist radical both led and reflected
larger trends.  By the time of the Soviet Union's collapse in 1992,
depictions of explicitly anarcho-libertarian future societies had
begun to filter into non-political SF works like Vernor Vinge's
<cite>Realtime</cite> sequence (1985) and Joe Haldeman's <cite>Buying
Time</cite> (1989). Haldeman's Conch Republic and Novysibirsk were all
the more convincing for not being subjects of polemic.</p>

<p>The 1980s also brought us a quasi-politicized movement pulling in
the opposite direction &mdash; cyberpunk, the third failed revolution
against Campbellian SF.  William Gibson, who is generally credited
with launching this subgenre in his <cite>Neuromancer</cite> (1984),
was not a political writer.  But Bruce Sterling, who promoted Gibson
and became the chief ideologue of anti-Campbellianism in the late
1980s, called cyberpunk "the Movement" in a self-conscious reference
to the heady era of 1960s student radicalism.  The cyberpunks
positioned themselves particularly against the carnographic
conservative military SF of Jerry Pournelle, David Drake, and their
lower-rent imitators &mdash; not exactly a hard target.</p>

<p>Despite such posturing, the cyberpunks were neither as
stylistically innovative nor as politically challenging as the New
Wave had been. Gibson's prose has aptly been described as Raymond
Chandler in mirror-shades. Cyberpunk themes (virtual reality,
pervasive computing, cyborging and biosculpture, corporate feudalism)
had been anticipated in earlier works like Frederik Pohl's <cite>Day
Million</cite> (1966), Vernor Vinge's hard-SF classic <cite>True
Names</cite> (1978), and even further back in <cite>The Space
Merchants</cite> (1956).  Cyberpunk imagery (decayed urban landscapes,
buzzcuts, chrome and black leather) quickly became a cliche replicated
in dozens of computer games.</p>

<p>Neal Stephenson wrote a satirical finis to the cyberpunk genre in
<cite>Snow Crash</cite> (1992), which with Bruce Sterling's
<cite>Schismatrix</cite> (1985) and Walter John Williams's
<cite>Hardwired</cite> (1986) was very close to being the only work to meet
the standard set by <cite>Neuromancer</cite>.  While most cyberpunk
took for granted a background in which capitalism had decayed
into an oppressive corporate feudalism under which most individuals
could be nothing but alienated and powerless, the future of <cite>Snow
Crash</cite> was a tellingly libertarian one.  The bedrock
individualism of Campbellian SF reasserted itself with a smartass
grin.</p>

<p>By the time cyberpunk fizzled out, most fans had been enjoying the
hard-SF renaissance for a decade; the New Wave was long gone, and
cyberpunk had attracted more notice outside the SF field than within
it.  The leaders of SF's tiny in-house critical establishment, however
(figures like Samuel Delany and David Hartwell), remained fascinated
by New Wave relics like Thomas Disch and Philip K. Dick, or
anti-Campbellian fringe figures like Suzette Hadin Elgin and Octavia
Butler.</p>

<p>While this was going on, the readers voted with their Hugo ballots
largely for writers that were squarely within the Campbellian
tradition &mdash; Golden Age survivors, the killer Bs, and newer
writers like Lois McMaster Bujold and Greg Egan (whose 1997 work
<cite>Diaspora</cite> may just be the single most audacious and
brilliant hard-SF novel in the entire history of the field).</p>

<p>In 1994, critical thinking within the SF field belatedly caught up
with reality.  Credit for this goes to David Hartwell and Kathryn
Cramer, whose analysis in the anthology <cite>The Ascent of
Wonder</cite> finally acknowledged what should have been obvious all
along.  Hard SF is the vital heart of the field, the radiant core from
which ideas and prototype worlds diffuse outwards to be appropriated
by writers of lesser world-building skill but perhaps greater
stylistic and literary sophistication.  While there are other modes
of SF that have their place, they remain essentially derivations of or
reactions against hard SF, and cannot even be properly understood
without reference to its tropes, conventions, and imagery.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Gregory Benford's essay in <cite>The Ascent of Wonder</cite>
on the meaning of SF offered a characterization of the genre which may well
prove final.  He located the core of SF in the experience of "sense of wonder",
not merely as a thalamic thrill but as the affirmation that the universe
has a knowable order that is discoverable through reason and science.</p>

<p>I think I can go further than Hartwell or Kramer or Benford in
defining the relationship between hard SF and the rest of the field.
To do this, I need to introduce the concept linguist George Lakoff calls
"radial category", one that is not defined by any one logical
predicate, but by a central prototype and a set of permissible or
customary variations.  As a simple example, in English the category
"fruit" does not correspond to any uniformity of structure that a
botanist could recognize.  Rather, the category has a prototype
"apple", and things are recognized as fruits to the extent that they
are either (a) like an apple, or (b) like something that has already
been sorted into the "like an apple" category.</p>

<p>Radial categories have central members ("apple", "pear", "orange")
whose membership is certain, and peripheral members ("coconut",
"avocado") whose membership is tenuous.  Membership is graded
by the distance from the central prototype &mdash; roughly, the
number of traits that have to mutate to get one from being like
the prototype to like the instance in question.  Some traits 
are important and tend to be conserved across the entire 
radial category (strong flavor including sweetness) while 
some are only weakly bound (bright color).</p>

<p>In most radial categories, it is possible to point out members that
are counterexamples to any single intensional ("logical") definition,
but traits that are common to most of the core prototypes nevertheless
tend to be strongly bound.  Thus, "coconut" is a counterexample to the
strongly-bound trait that fruits have soft skins, but it is sorted as
"fruit" because (like the prototype members) it has an easily-chewable
interior with a sweet flavor.</p>

<p>SF is a radial category in which the prototypes are certain
classics of hard SF.  This is true whether you are mapping individual
works by affinity or subgenres like space opera, technology-of-magic
story, utopian/dystopian extrapolation, etc.  So in discussing the
traits of SF as a whole, the relevant question is not "which traits
are universal" but "which traits are strongly bound" &mdash; or,
almost equivalently, "what are the shared traits of most of the core
(hard-SF) prototypes".</p>

<p>The strong binding between hard SF and libertarian politics
continues to be a fact of life in the field.  It it is telling that
the <em>only</em> form of politically-inspired award presented
annually at the World Science Fiction Convention is the Libertarian
Futurist Society's "Prometheus".  There is no socialist, liberal,
moderate, conservative or fascist equivalent of the class of
libertarian SF writers including L. Neil Smith, F. Paul Wilson, Brad
Linaweaver, or J. Neil Schulman; their books, even when they are
shrill and indifferently-written polemical tracts, actually
<em>sell</em> &mdash; and sell astonishingly well &mdash; to SF
fans.</p>

<p>Of course, there are people in the SF field who find this deeply 
uncomfortable.  Since the centrality of hard SF has become inescapable,
resistance now takes the form of attempts to divorce hard SF from 
libertarianism &mdash; to preserve the methods and conceptual apparatus
of hard SF while repudiating its political aura.  Hartwell
&amp; Kramer's 2002 followup to <cite>The Ascent of Wonder</cite>,
<cite>The Hard SF Renaissance</cite>, takes up this argument in its
introduction and explanatory notes.</p>

<p><cite>The Hard SF Renaissance</cite> presents itself as a dialogue
between old-school Campbellian hard SF and an attempt to construct a
"Radical Hard SF" that is not in thrall to right-wing tendencies.  
It is clear that the editors' sympathies lie with the "Radicals", not
least from the very fact that they identify libertarianism as a right-wing
phenomenon.  This is an error characteristic of left-leaning thinkers,
who tend to assume that anything not "left" is "right" and that approving 
of free markets somehow implies social conservatism.</p>

<p>Is the "Radical Hard SF" program possible?  Partly this is a matter
of definition.  I have already shown that the SF genre
<em>cannot</em> be culturally or politically conservative; by nature
it must be prepared to contemplate &mdash; and implicitly advocate
&mdash; radical change.  So either the partisans of "Radical Hard SF"
are just terminally confused, pushing against an open door, or what
they really object to is hard SF's libertarian connection.</p>

<p>It's worth asking, then: is the intimate historical relationship
between libertarian political thought and SF a mere accident, or is
there an intrinsic connection?  And not worth asking merely as a
question about politics, either; we'll understand SF and its history
better if we know the answer.</p>

<p>I think I know what John Campbell's answer would be, if he had not
died the year that the founders of modern libertarianism broke with
conservatism.  I know what Robert Heinlein's was.  They're the same as
mine, a resounding yes &mdash; that there is a connection, and that
the connection is indeed deep and intrinsic.  But cultural history
is littered with the corpses of zealots who attempted to yoke art to
ideology with shallow arguments, only to be exposed as fools when the
art became obsolescent before the ideology or (more often)
vice-versa.</p>

<p>In the remainder of this essay I will nevertheless attempt to prove
this point. My argument will center around the implications of a
concept best known from First Amendment law: the "marketplace of
ideas".  I am going to argue specifically from the characteristics
of hard SF, the prototypes of the radial category of SF.  I'll use
this argument to try to illuminate the central values of SF as
a literature, and to explain the large historical pattern of failed
revolutions against the Campbellian model.</p>

<p>Science fiction, as a literature, embraces the possibility of
radical transformations of the human condition brought about through
knowledge.  Technological immortality, star drives, cyborging &mdash;
characteristic SFnal tropes such as these are situated within a
knowable universe, one in which scientific inquiry is both the
precondition and the principal instrument of creating new futures.</p>

<p>SF is, broadly, optimistic about these futures.  This is so for the
simple reason that SF is fiction bought with peoples' entertainment
budgets and people, in general, prefer happy endings to sad ones.  But
even when SF is not optimistic, its dystopias and cautionary tales
tend to affirm the power of reasoned choices made in a knowable
universe; they tell us that it is not through chance or the whim of
angry gods that we fail, but through our <em>failure</em> to be
intelligent, our failure to use the power of reason and science
and engineering prudently.</p>

<p>At bottom, the central assumption of SF is that applied science is
our best hope of transcending the major tragedies and minor irritants
to which we are all heir.  Even when scientists and engineers are not
the visible heroes of the story, they are the invisible heroes that
make the story notionally possible in the first place, the creators of
possibility, the people who liberate the future to become a different
place than the present.</p>

<p>SF both satisfies and stimulates a sort of lust for possibility
compounded of simple escapism and a complex intellectual delight in
anticipating the future.  SF readers and writers want to believe that
the future not only can be different but can be different in many,
many weird and wonderful ways, all of which are worth exploring.</p>

<p>All the traits (embrace of radical transformation, optimism,
applied science as our best hope, the lust for possibilities) are
weakly characteristic of SF in general &mdash; but they are
<em>powerfully</em> characteristic of hard SF.  Strongly bound, in the
terminology of radial categories.</p>

<p>Therefore, hard SF has a bias towards valuing the human traits and
social conditions that best support scientific inquiry and permit it
to result in transformative changes to both individuals and societies.
Also, of social equilibria which allow individuals the greatest scope
for choice, for satisfying that lust for possibilities.  And it is is
here that we begin to get the first hints that the strongly-bound
traits of SF imply a political stance &mdash; because not all
political conditions are equally favorable to scientific inquiry and
the changes it may bring. Nor to individual choice.</p>

<p>The power to suppress free inquiry, to limit the choices and thwart
the disruptive creativity of individuals, is the power to strangle
the bright transcendant futures of optimistic SF.  Tyrants, static
societies, and power elites fear change above all else &mdash; their
natural tendency is to suppress science, or seek to distort it for
ideological ends (as, for example, Stalin did with Lysenkoism). In the
narratives at the center of SF, political power is the natural enemy
of the future.</p>

<p>SF fans and writers have always instinctively understood this.
Thus the genre's long celebration of individualist anti-politics; thus
its fondness for voluntarism and markets over state action, and for
storylines in which (as in Heinlein's archetypal <cite>The Man Who
Sold The Moon</cite> (1951)) scientific breakthrough and
free-enterprise economics blend into a seamless whole. These stances
are not historical accidents, they are structural imperatives that
follow from the lust for possibility.  Ideological fashions come and
go, and the field inevitably rediscovers itself afterwards as a
literature of freedom.</p>

<p>This analysis should put permanently to rest the notion that hard
SF is a conservative literature in any sense.  It is, in fact, deeply
and fundamentally radical &mdash; the literature that celebrates not
merely science and technology but technology-driven social change as a
permanent revolution, as the final and most inexorable foe of all
fixed power relationships everywhere.</p>

<p>Earlier, I cited the following traits of SF's libertarian
tradition: ornery and insistant individualism, veneration of the
competent man, instinctive distrust of coercive social engineering and
a rock-ribbed objectivism that values knowing how things work and
treats all political ideologizing with suspicion.  All should now be
readily explicable.  These are the traits that mark the enemies of the
enemies of the future.

<p>The partisans of "Radical Hard SF", like those of the earlier
failed revolutions, are thus victims of a category error, an
inability to see beyond their own political maps.  By jamming SF's
native libertarianism into a box labeled "right wing" or
"conservative" they doom themselves to misunderstanding the deepest
imperatives of the genre.<p>

<p>By understanding these imperatives, on the other hand, we can
explain the series of failed revolutions against the Campellian 
model that is the largest pattern in the history of modern SF.
We can also predict two important things about the future of
the SF genre itself.</p>

<p>One: people whose basic political philosophy is flatly incompatible
with libertarianism will continue to find the SF mainstream an
uncomfortable place to be.  Therefore, sporadic ideological revolts
against the Campbellian model of SF will continue, probably about the
established rate of one per decade.  The Futurians, the New Wave, the
cyberpunks, and "Radical Hard SF" were not the end of that story,
because the larger political questions that motivated those
insurrections are not yet resolved.</p>

<p>Two: all these revolts will fail in pretty much the same way.  The
genre will absorb or routinize their literary features and discard
their political agendas.  And SF will continue to puzzle observers
who mistake its anti-political DNA for conservatism while missing
its underlying radicalism.</p>
