most important interactions are the spontaneous ones that happen 
because you've got a lot of people with similar interests bumping into
each other.  The more of these an attendee experiences, the richer his
or her experience will be.</p><p>The way to encourage these interactions is to create areas in the 
social space that people naturally gravitate to when they have 
nothing else to do.  Here are two good techniques:</p><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="sect2"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="id2765252"/>Have a traffic focus during the day</h3></div></div><p>If possible, try to arrange the physical layout of your convention
space so there's one traffic area that people more or less need to
pass through in order to move between program items, the show floor, 
and their hotel rooms.  Ideally this area should have places to sit
and snack food nearby.</p><p>What you're trying to do is make a comfortable place to wait for
events that tends to gather people and promote conversation.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="sect2"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="id2765276"/>Have a central hospitality suite at night</h3></div></div><p>The biggest single design mistake that people who run technical
conventions make is failing to promote after-hours social interaction.
If people just dissipate after dinnertime for lack of a place to find
conversation, that's a sin and a waste.  Any SF fan knows that the
really worthwhile stuff at a convention happens between 9:00 PM and
two or three in the morning.</p><p>The way to fix this is to have what SF fans call a `con suite' --
a suite or public room open at least from just before the end of daily
programming until early the following morning.  At some SF conventions
the con suite never closes.</p><p>The con suite should feature lots of places to sit.  It should have 
sodas and snack food, and perhaps beer.  You'll need one or two people
to run it, but this is light duty; it mainly consists of keeping the
snack bowls filled and a bit of cleanup.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="sect2"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="id2765311"/>Sign, sign, everywhere a sign</h3></div></div><p>Informative signs are vastly more important than people usually
realize.  Your event won't work if the attendees and staff can't find
things.  It's also important to help attendees form a clear mental map
of what's where which (among other things) tells them where the focal
areas are.</p><p>Each program room should have a sign listing its event times.  Key
locations like the con suite, convention ops room, and green room should be
signposted.  The registration desk should have a large sign nearby
featuring a floorplan of the public areas.  Key intersections in the hall
pattern should have this-way/that-way signs pointing to nearby
locations.</p><p>Good signs reduce the hour-by-hour friction costs of running the
event.  This is so important that there should be one person on staff whose
<span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i>only</i></span> pre-convention job is to worry about signage --
to walk through the space in advance locating and laying out signs, and
then making sure they're printed and erected before the convention
opens.</p></div></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="index.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s03.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Conventions at Light Speed: What Hackers Can Learn From SF Fandom </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Programming without bugs</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
