utterly ragged because they're rushing around fighting fires all the time.
SF fans have found that a lot of this can be prevented by having a
well-designed table of organization.</p><p>Such a table has multiple functions.  It defines areas of
responsibility, so people know whose job a given task logically is.
It helps pinpoint areas where staffing may be inadequate.  And
(perhaps most importantly) it helps the core staff figure out which
jobs can be done by gofers.  Gofer hours are cheap compared to core
staff hours; you want to use gofers as far up in your organization as
you can (but no further).</p><p>At SF conventions there are generally <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i>three</i></span> tiers of
organization; the convention committee, the core staff, and the
gofers.</p><p>The convention committee sometimes incorporates themselves as the
directors of a nonprofit organization formed to run the event; they're the
people legally responsible for the convention.  Their main job is to manage
the core staff.</p><p>The core staff are volunteers recruited before the convention by the
concom.  Core staff have full-time responsibilities at the con.</p><p>Gofers (as we've discussed above) are part-time volunteers recruited
at the convention itself.  They're the footsoldiers.</p><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="sect2"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="id2761342"/>The convention committee</h3></div></div><p>The convention committee (or `concom' in fanspeak) are the managers of
the core staff.  Here are some of the jobs that belong on the concom:</p><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="sect3"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="id2761354"/>Convention chairperson</h4></div></div><p>The buck stops with the con chairperson.  The concom votes on policy
before the convention, but at the convention itself the chair's word is
final.  He is the chief firefighter and troubleshooter.</p><p>It's important that the con chair <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i>not</i></span> have other
jobs besides being con chair.  If he does, he will stress out and probably
lose the big picture while chasing lower-level problems.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="sect3"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="id2761380"/>Convention vice-chair</h4></div></div><p>The vice-chair's job is to backstop the convention chair and stand in
for him if necessary.  It is not quite as critical that the vice-chair have
no other jobs, but it is still a good idea to avoid this if possible.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="sect3"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="id2761395"/>Chief of programming</h4></div></div><p>This position is what technical conventions usually call ``program
chair''.  This person is a department head responsible for designing
the convention program, recruiting speakers, and assembling the
program schedule.</p><p>The actual printing of the convention booklet is sometimes attached
to the programming department.  Otherwise there's a separate concom-level
director of publications.</p><p>The chief-of-programming job should <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i>not</i></span> be
combined with ops chief, hotel liaison, or vendor relations.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="sect3"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="id2761427"/>Chief of operations</h4></div></div><p>This person (``ops chief'') is a department head responsible for managing
the core staff at the convention.  Operations areas include gofer
management, registration, security, signage, the con suite, management of
AV equipment, and sometimes running (as opposed to planning) the
programming.</p><p>This job should <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i>not</i></span> be combined with program
chair, hotel liaison, or vendor relations.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="sect3"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="id2761452"/>Hotel liaison</h4></div></div><p>This person is responsible for relations with the convention hotels.
This includes both arranging room blocking before the convention and
dealing with reservation problems and facilities snafus during it.</p><p>At large conventions, hotel liaison is a full department with several
core staff attached to the director.  This is mainly so at least one
can be on call to handle problems at all hours.</p><p>This job should <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i>not</i></span> be combined with ops chief,
program chair, or vendor relations.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="sect3"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="id2761485"/>Vendor relations</h4></div></div><p>This person is responsible for the show floor -- booth sales before
the convention, troubleshooting vendor problems during it.</p><p>This job should <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i>not</i></span> be combined with ops chief,
program chair, or hotel liaison.</p></div></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="sect2"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="id2811146"/>Core staff</h3></div></div><p>Core staff are organized into departments, each directed by a concom
member.  Some departments (such as hotel liaison at a small con) can be
one-man shows.  Others (such as operations) need to be generously
staffed.</p><p>Again, at the convention itself the core staff should spend most of their
time managing gofers who do the actual legwork.  One of the functions of
a ``gopher hole'' room is to provide a labor pool.</p></div></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s04.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s06.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Peer-to-peer communications </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Conclusion: Doing it with style</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
