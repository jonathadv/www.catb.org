The practices I've
described are intended to help you work smart.</p><p>One thing many hackers have in common with many SF fans is the
combination of poor socialization with intelligence and a problem-solving
attitude.  While the poor socialization can make both kinds of attendees
irritating to deal with, the intelligence and problem-solving attitude
means they also tend to be very productive if you know how to manage
them.</p><p>Accordingly, work on your communication and persuasion skills -- and use
them to offload as much of the work as possible onto gofers and random
volunteers recruited on the spot.  Don't think of this as laziness, think
of it as self-preservation.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s05.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> </td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Staff Organization </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table></div></body></html>
