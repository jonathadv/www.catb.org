<p>Parts of TAOUP are going to pose interesting challenges for a
translator.  I know I'm not an easy writer to translate out of English;
my production vocabulary is very large, my style often swerves between
formality and slangy idiomatic usages within a single paragraph, and many
of my phrasings are subtle allusions to both classics and popular
culture.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the demand for overseas translation rights was early
and strong.  To make things easier, I've put together some crib notes on
how to translate TAOUP effectively.  As I field more questions I will
add the answers to this page.</p>

<h1>General advice</h1>

<p>This book, or identifiable portions of it anyway, is more like
literature than most technical books are.  By that I mean that the
rhythm and style of the prose is relatively important, and that the
book is, in significant part, telling a story.  A <em>true</em> story;
but significant parts of it (the History and Futures chapters, for
example) might be poorly served by a very literal translation if the
result is dry, colorless, and loses its narrative drive.</p>

<p>Below I give advice on how to translate various bits that I think
might be obscure to a non-native speaker of English.  My advice
generally comes down to this: find an equivalent idiom rather than
translating word by word.  Do not be afraid of phrasings that are
unconventional or humorous &mdash; I do a lot of that in the original
English, and I would dislike a translation that was all cookie-cutter
&lsquo;safe&rsquo; prose.  If you think you detect irony or an
occasional flash of anger, you are probably right &mdash; let that
come through in your translation, too.  Relax and stretch
yourself. Take chances.</p>

<h1>Chapter 1: Philosophy</h1>

<p>The section heading <cite>Culture?  What culture?</cite> is intended to
recall the phrase &ldquo;Crisis?  What crisis?&rdquo;.  Originally the title
of an album by a long-defunct '70s pop group called Supertramp, this has 
passed into idiomatic English as a way of suggesting that the speaker
thinks the listener might be getting upset about nothing or making too
much of trivialities.  Translate idiomatically rather than literally 
if possible.</p>

<p>To understand how the section heading <cite>Flexibility all the way
down</cite> will be read by a native speaker, see this famous story
about <a
href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down'>turtles
all the way down</a>.  Try to translate with a similar sense of
fun.</p>

<h1>Chapter 2: History</h1>

<p>The section heading <cite>Blows against the Empire</cite> recalls the 
title of a still-famous 1970 rock album, and native English speakers will
likely think of the phrase &ldquo;Evil Empire&rdquo; used of the Soviet 
Union in the 1980s.  These references are intentional.  Translate with 
an idiom suggesting heroic rebellion, if possible.</p>

<h1>Chapter 3: Contrasts</h1>

<p><em>&ldquo;almost, but not entirely unlike a webserver running
CGI&rdquo;</em> This is deliberately perverse syntax.  It's a
reference to a very silly novel called <cite>The Hitchhiker's Guide To
The Galaxy</cite>.  The &ldquo;almost&rdquo; applies to the word
&ldquo;unlike&rdquo;.  There is probably no sense in trying to
preserve the exact reference for non-English speakers, so feel free to
untangle the sentence in your translation.</p>

<h1>Chapter 7: Multiprogramming</h1>

<p><em>&ldquo;fleeing in terror might well be an appropriate
response&rdquo;</em> The mental image you want to evoke in the reader
is of a screaming crowd fleeing in abject terror as Godzilla levels
another city block.  If this sentence does not come out funny, you
have translated it wrong.</p>

<h1>Chapter 12: Optimization</h1>

<p>The section heading <cite>Don't Just Do Something, Stand
There!</cite> is a deliberate inversion of <cite>Don't just stand
there, do something!</cite> which is idiomatically what native English
speakers expect to hear when a bystander's failure to act is
exasperating the speaker beyond reason.  If there is a parallel idiom in
your target language, use that rather than translating literally.</p>

<h1>Chapter 13: Complexity</h1>

<p>The section heading <cite>A Tale of Five Editors</cite> refers to
the title of a famous Dickens novel, <cite>A Tale of Two
Cities</cite>.  If this has been translated into your target language,
use the same nouns as that title.</p>

<h1>Chapter 14: Languages</h1>

<p>The section heading <cite>Unix's Cornucopia of Languages</cite>;
the word &ldquo;cornucopia&rdquo; means &ldquo;horn of plenty&rdquo;,
a magical device from ancient Greek myth that gave forth food and
drink on command.  If this is not a live reference in your target
language, any mythological device that spontaneously produces wealth
will do.</p>

<h1>Chapter 17: Portability</h1>

<p>The section heading <cite>The Ghost at the Victory
Banquet</cite> is a reference to Banquo's ghost in the Shakespeare
play <cite>Macbeth</cite>.  This will be a live reference in Germany
and the few other non-English speaking countries where Shakespeare is
well known.  Where he is not, feel free to substitute a local symbol
of the unquiet past, of old sins coming back to haunt.</p>

<h1>Chapter 20: Futures</h1>

<p>The section heading <cite>The Way The Future Was</cite> is
lifted from Frederik Pohl's memoir of his life among the Futurians, a
notable group of science-fiction fans in the 1940s and '50s.  Try to
find a way to translate this that conveys a feeling of
nostalgia for a better time.</para>

<h1>The Unix koans</h1>

<p>Undoubtedly the hardest part of the book to translate well is
Appendix D, <cite>The Unix Koans of Master Foo</cite>, which is a
carefully constructed English-language parody of Japanese translations
of Chinese Zen Buddhist sources.  Here is the note I wrote for
translators in a comment in the original XML:</p>

<blockquote>
    This is a parody.  To achieve the intended effect, the introduction
    should be translated in a dry, academic style and the koans themselves
    into the sort of language one might expect to find in a religious text;
    poetic, formal, somewhat archaic.  If you happen to be translating
    into Japanese or Chinese (languages of the Zen primary sources)
    it would be a good idea to read the Heart Sutra and the Gateless Gate
    first; there are turns of phrase here that are intended to mirror 
    language in those texts, and the translation should reflect this.
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, it would be a good idea to read target-language translations of the
<a
href='http://members.ozemail.com.au/~mooncharts/heartsutra/english.html'>Heart
Sutra</a> and <a
href='http://www.ibiblio.org/zen/cgi-bin/koan-index.pl'>Gateless
Gate</a> no matter what target language you are translating TAOUP into,
unless you can assume your readers are familiar with an English
translation of these sources.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The references to the Eastern and Western schools are meant to
recall the Northern (gradual-enlightenment) and Southern
(sudden-enlightenment) schools of Chinese Zen (these are better known
to most Westerners through the Soto and Rinzai tendencies in Japanese
Buddhism).  The term &lsquo;patriarch&rsquo; should be rendered as
whatever formal title scholars in your target language use for the
Patriarchs of Zen. If there isn't one, use a word or phrase with the
sense of &lsquo;Great Master&rsquo;, &lsquo;Grandmaster&rsquo;, or
&lsquo;Revered Master&rsquo;.</p>

<p>The name &ldquo;Nubi&rdquo; is a play on the English slang term
&lsquo;newbie&rsquo;.  This seems to have originated as a British
public school slang contraction of &ldquo;new boy&rdquo;, remained in
live use in the British military, and entered wide use on the Internet
after 1990.  If you think most of your readers will hear the echo of
English &ldquo;new&rdquo; in the first syllable, leave it alone (this
will work in most European languages).  Otherwise try to think of a
personal name in your target language with a first syllable matching the
first syllable of the target-language word for &ldquo;new&rdquo;.</p>

<h2>Master Foo and the Ten Thousand Lines</h2>

<p>&ldquo;Unix-nature&rdquo; is, of course, a take on the Zen
technical term &ldquo;Buddha-nature&rdquo; (Japanese
&ldquo;busshou&rdquo; or &ldquo;hotokeshou&rdquo;) and should be
translated to resemble your target language's word or phrase for the
latter.  Similarly, for &ldquo;emptiness&rdquo; you want whatever
scholars in your target language use as a translation of the Sanskrit
word &ldquo;sunyata&rdquo; (Japanese &ldquo;kuu&rdquo; or
&ldquo;koushou&rdquo;).  And &ldquo;enlightened&rdquo; should connect
to the target-language translation of the Japanese
&ldquo;satori&rdquo; or &ldquo;kensho&rdquo;.</p>

<h2>Master Foo and the Script Kiddie</h2>

<p>The barbarous speech of the stranger from the land of Woot is
leet-speak, a dialect of written English found mainly in email and on
chat systems; it may have no counterpart elsewhere. Simply doing
silly orthographic substitutions in the same style might carry you
through.</p>

<h2>Master Foo Discourses on the Two Paths</h2>

<p>Another sensitive bit is in where he yells &ldquo;Three pounds of
VAX!&rdquo;.  The full effect of this line in English depends on the
rhyme with the koan <a
href='http://www.ibiblio.org/zen/gateless-gate/18.html'>Tozan's Three
Pounds</a> from Gateless Gate:</p>

<pre>
    A monk asked Tozan when he was weighing some flax: &lsquo;What is Buddha?&rsquo;

    Tozan said: `Three pounds of flax' 
</pre>

<p>It also depends on the fact that the VAX minicomputer was a very
important early Unix machine in the 1980s.  How you're going to make
this reference work in any target language where VAX doesn't rhyme with the
target-language word for &ldquo;flax&rdquo;, I have no idea.  It's a challenge
for the translator. You might want to see if you can find a target-language
translation of the koan and parallel that.</p>

<p>The terms &ldquo;sutra&rdquo; (=&ldquo;scroll&rdquo;) and
&ldquo;dharma&rdquo; (=&ldquo;tradition&rdquo; or
&ldquo;teaching&rdquo;, usually of Buddhist or Hindu religious ideas)
can probably be left untranslated.  If your readers don't recognize
them, they'll already be too hopelessly lost for a translation to help
much.</p>

<h2>Master Foo and the Methodologist</h2>

<p>The word &ldquo;profile&rdquo; is a computer term of art that means
to collect performance statistics on code while it is running.  If your
target language does not have an exact equivalent, use a verb with the sense
of &ldquo;monitor&rdquo;, &ldquo;instrument&rdquo; or 
&ldquo;time&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The sentence: &ldquo;continually measure your productivity while
managing resources&rdquo;. This is meant to sound like stuffy, stupid
management-speak.  Translate accordingly.</p>

<h2>Master Foo Discourses on the Graphical User Interface</h2>

<p>The phrase &ldquo;Great Way&rdquo; (of Zen) shows up in a lot of
English-language Zen literature; it's &lsquo;daido&rsquo; in Japanses.  If
you are translating into one of the other Zen source languages, there
is probably an exact technical translation; be sure to find out what
it is and use it.</p>

<p>In translating this koan, you may find it useful to meditate on the
following simpler one: &ldquo;The mind is like a dog.  His master
points at the moon, but he barks at the hand.&rdquo; The animal in this
koan is also the same one that appears in the first koan of Gateless
Gate, <a
href='http://www.ibiblio.org/zen/gateless-gate/1.html'>Joshu's
Dog</a>.</p>

<h2>Master Foo and the Unix Zealot</h2>

<p>MCSE is an abbreviation for &ldquo;Microsoft Certified Systems
Engineer&rdquo;. There is probably a term for this, and
corresponding abbreviation, in your target language.  Use it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;it would transform mind&rdquo; Special note for those
translating into French; this is indended to recall a famous line from
one version of the Surrealist Manifesto, &ldquo;the liberation of mind
and all that resembles it&rdquo;.  Translate accordingly.</p>

<h2>Master Foo Discourses on the Unix-Nature</h2>

<p>The knottiest bits in the whole Koans may be here.  First,
&ldquo;Not code. Not name. Not mind. Not things.&rdquo; This is almost
a direct lift from <a
href='http://www.ibiblio.org/zen/gateless-gate/27.html'>koan #27</a>
of <cite>Gateless Gate</cite>.  If you are translating to one of the
Zen source languages, use this fact.  Next: </p>

<blockquote>
&ldquo;Moving in accordance with the law of nature, it unfolds inexorably in
the minds of programmers, assimilating designs to its own nature. All
software that would compete with it must become like to it; empty,
empty, profoundly empty, perfectly void, hail!&rdquo;
</blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;Moving in accordance with the law of nature&rdquo; is a
frequent phrase in English translations of the <cite>Tao Te
Ching</cite>, but I don't know the original Chinese.  The last line is
an intended reference to &ldquo;Om, gate, gate, paragate, parasamgate,
bodhi, svaha!&rdquo;, the climactic line of the Heart Sutra, which is
usually translated into English as something like &ldquo;Gone, all
gone, all gone beyond, there will be enlightenment,
<em>hail</em>!&rdquo;. That parallelism needs to come through in
translation, which means you need to know by what features an educated
reader in your target language would recognize the Heart Sutra.</p>

<h2>Master Foo and the End User</h2>

<p>English has an uncommon but established usage of the noun
&lsquo;chop&rsquo; for a Chinese-style signature stamp, often used for
signing documents.  Thus, in English, for something to be made under
someone's chop means it was made with that person's authority or
organizing influence; the term also suggests an Oriental context. Your
target language's equivalent for &lsquo;seal&rsquo; will do.</p>
