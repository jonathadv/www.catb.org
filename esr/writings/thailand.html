<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Five Nights In Bangkok</H1>

<p>When I was invited to do my road show in Bangkok, Thailand for a
U.N.-sponsored event called "Asian Youth Forum" addressing
"sustainable Third-World development" (17-25 May 2002), I leapt at the
chance even though I was rather dubious about the event itself.</p>

<p>The chance to visit a new part of Asia for the first time was
appealing, but given the conference theme I feared being surrounded
for a week by the sandal-wearing enviro-Greens who seem to dominate
U.N. conferences these days -- crypto-Marxists who refuse to get a
clue how horribly destructive their disdain for markets and free trade
and economic liberty is towards the poor people their hearts are
supposedly bleeding for.  I knew it would be a strain for me to remain
polite to such people for very long.  I very nearly turned the
organizers down, but decided I could simply fulfill my speaking duties
and ignore the rest of the conference for sightseeing if the bullshit
got too thick.</p>

<p>Fortunately, it turns out AYF is run by a group of Asian university
students who are not part of the anti-globalization yahoo crowd.
They're trying to get themselves affiliated to the UN as a
secretariat.  The goal of the conference was to develop a charter.  I
saw a lot of earnest naivete and a bit of fumbling, but not the
vicious politicized stupidity I was half-expecting.  At least not on
the first day.</p>

<p>It took me thirty-three hours of train and air time and airport
layovers to get from Malvern to Bangkok.  Philadelphia to San
Francisco, San Francisco to Taipei, Taipei to Bangkok.  It all blurred
together after a while.  Thank Goddess for the reclining seats in First
Class; I managed to sleep for about nine hours on the SF-to-Taipei leg,
and so wasn't too jet-lagged when I landed.</p>

<p>The bit of fumbling started when, for no reason anyone was able to
explain, they flew me in two days early and I landed before the
conference was properly set up.  Not a real problem, as it turned out,
since my hotel room in Bangkok featured a live Internet port, so I
could stave off boredom by working.</p>

<p>I spent Friday morning and some of Saturday with Martin Sommer, a
conference organizer who had been assigned to take care of me.
Half-Thai, half-German, raised in Western ways but a fluent Thai
speaker, he filled me in on a lot of useful trivia about Thai language
and customs.</p>

<p>Saturday morning Martin and I shifted my digs to a hotel on the
campus of Assumption University, the host of the conference.  The
campus was pretty impressive in itself -- monstrously huge buildings
in a weird cross between brutalist modernism and cathedral
architecture, spaced widely apart across over square miles of
manicured parkland.  The usual pleasant Asiatic casualness about the
boundaries of religion is evident here; though Assumption University
is Catholic, one of the most conspicuous structures on campus is a
Buddhist meditation pavilion, with multi-tiered roofs elaborately
carved and gilded in the native Thai style.</p>

<p>Saturday afternoon we tried to visit a Buddhist temple near the
University, but it was all closed up -- locked gates across the entrance
stairways, something I hadn't seen elsewhere in Asia.  The buildings
were pretty impressive even from the outside, though.  Cunningly
curved roofs, elaborate carving and gold-leafed spires produce an
effect of gorgeous richness.</p>

<p>Then we went off to eat lunch at what Martin described at a
traditional Thai roadside restaurant.  The thing was basically one big
roof on posts, like the mother of all garden gazebos, with the
cookstoves clustered under one end.  It was run by a family of smiling
Thais, obviously rural peasants on the make in the big city.  The
menu (which Martin had to translate for me) featured a mix-and-match
assortment of rice, peppers, different kinds of meat, and noodles.</p>

<p>The food was excellent, like American Thai food but simpler.  I
asked Martin and he confirmed that we were eating Thai country
cooking, not the urban cuisine that normally gets exported.  I had
crispy fried pork with peppers over rice.  Martin had some
fried-chicken skewers.</p>

<p>The table came equipped with a couple different sauces, including
ordinary red-pepper paste and a soy-with-herbs combination.  The
standout, though, was some wonderful fiery stuff called "nam pla
prig".  The "nam pla" part is a delicate, aromatic fish sauce that
looks and tastes a lot like the Vietnamese stuff called "nuoc mam".
The "prig" part refers to the diced red peppers floating in it.  The
intensely <em>hot</em> diced red peppers.  I was a happy boy.</p>

<p>The bright, sunny weather when we sat down to eat turned into a
drenching monsoon rain about the time we were finishing.  The owners,
doubtless used to quick-starting and quick-ending downpours, didn't
bother unrolling the plastic tarps hanging from the eaves.  As we were
lightly sprinkled by the wind-driven rain blowing under the roof
Martin observed that it was surprisingly chill for mid-May. Usually,
he told me, the monsoon rains are blood-warm.</p>

<p>Sunday morning the conference launched with the expected speeches
by various dignitaries.  These included Thailand's Secretary for
University Affairs and the rector of the University, an ascetic-looking
man in a white cassock who everyone addressed as Brother Martin. Mercifully,
the speeches were short.</p>

<p>My first real chance to mix with the delegates was just before the
opening ceremony and during the coffee break just afterwards.  Though
the working language of the conference was English, many delegates
turned out not to have much production vocabulary.  They would nod and
smile and appear to understand me but have trouble replying.</p>

<p>One charming exception was Jadamba Tsolmon, of all things an
orthodontist from Ulan Bator (the capitol of Mongolia).  A poised,
pretty, outgoing woman, she spoke quite fluent English and discussed
the history of her country with me.  Unfortunately we discovered that
she had wandered onto the wrong shuttle bus at the airport and was
actually supposed to be at a different conference -- with the Asian
Students Association, not the Asian Youth Forum!  Tsolmon was a bit
conflicted by the situation, as she had struck up some friendships the
previous night and also particularly wanted to see my talk.</p>

<p>I watched with interest as she untangled this snafu with the
conference organizers; it turned out one was planning to go over to
the ASA conference after tonight's dinner and could take her over with
him. At least this meant she would get to spend the rest of the day
with her new friends, and to see my road show as well.  She handed me
her card and invited me to keep in touch afterwards.</p>

<p>During the coffee break the one other paleface among the delegates
introduced herself to me.  She was a light brunette with
peaches-and-cream skin that looked rather startling amidst all those
bronze Asian faces and glossy black hair. I learned that she is named
Natalya, an ethnic Russian from Kirgizstan, and she confided that she was
feeling a bit out of place and glad to see another European here.</p>

<p>In the first session, on "Problems of Education and Information
Dissemination", the questions were more intelligent than the answers.
The student delegates raised real questions, like "What is the best
strategy for helping people in the Third World get Internet access?"
and got long-winded and mostly meaningless answers, full of politics
and faunching for more foreign aid, from a UNICEF bureaucrat.</p>

<p>I spoke in the second session, on "Information technology and
development".  It seemed to go well, though I got a couple of
questions from people who seemed to have persistent problems making
the open/closed distinction.  Following my talk and the inevitable
coffee break, we finished the afternoon session with an open
discussion period.  The UNICEF drone having departed, the discussion
was a good deal more productive.</p>

<p>By the first-night dinner, Tsolmon and I and Natalya and Saidolam
Djuraev (a delegate from Uzbekistan) and Sarah from Iran, and Sarah's
husband Dr. Pejman had formed into someting of a krewe.  Dinner was
Thai food accompanied by an exhibition of traditional Thai dance;
stately, graceful maneuvers performed by women in elaborate silk
brocades and fantastic gilded headdresses.</p>

<p>Then we got a bit of a curveball -- a different group of dancers
performing to electronic music with a rock/dance beat, wearing a sort
of goth version of Thai dance costume, all black and silver.  It was
very interesting to see the gestural language of the traditional
dances we had just seen adapted and mixed with moves from modern dance
and even gymnastics.  I think this demonstrated that the Thai dance
tradition is alive, and not just a museum piece to be statically
revered.</p>

<p>Afterwards more hang time.  Tsolmon headed over to the ASA conference,
muttering about coming back here tomorrow.  Natalya, discovering I'm a
musician, mentioned that she had a CD of Kirghiz traditional music she
would love for me to hear; unfortunately we weren't able to scare up
a computer with both CD-ROM drive and speakers.</p>

<p>Breakfast Monday morning was the worst bummer of the trip so far --
college cafeteria food is crappy the world over, but cold
sunny-side-up eggs?  Blecchh!  Martin and I snuck out to a roadside
noodle stand (across the street from where we had eaten lunch
yesterday) during the morning discussion period.  Egg noodles and
roast pork with hot peppers and greens...mmmm.  Thai food good!</p>

<p>The day's sessions were uneventful.  I contributed a bit, finding
that my perspective as the only First-Worlder in the room got more
respect than I had expected.  Over lunch with the krewe Sarah from
Iran confessed that she had been expecting <em>me</em> to be more
prejudiced (in some sort of ugly-American way she didn't really
specify) but thought that all my comments were admirably balanced and
befitting a scientist.  I thanked her for the compliment.</p>

<p>(Sarah, by the way, is light-skinned enough to be European but
actually has the astonishingly huge liquid Persian eyes you see on
people in Moghul miniatures.  It's an arresting combination.  When I
asked her husband Dr. Pejman if many Persian women have eyes like
that, he smiled and said "I was very selective".  Dr. Pejman himself,
I learn, is both an academic and one of the top five players of the
Iranian dulcimer.  His presentation on the causes and consequences of
Third-to-First-World brain drain is excellent.  Sarah, too, has been
selective.)</p>

<p>Sarah's presentation on the effects of sexual/medical ignorance
among Iranian women led to some discussion of cultural value conflicts
about sex education.  I refrained from publicly sharing the insight I
had about that, though some of the krewe had a good laugh with me
about it later.  Worldwide, I realized, the basic cultural conflict
about sex education is that the teachers want the students to learn
self-control and abstinence, but the students want to learn
<em>technique</em>...</p>

<p>Tuesday night got a little strange after the expected Thai dinner
with the krewe and yet another dance troupe.  There was live music
from a four-piece ensemble called "Music Club".  They were pretty 
good players, but their repertoire consisted entirely of wedding-band
schlock -- slow drippy luuuuhv ballads, '50s grease music and an
indifferent cover of "Play That Funky Music, White Boy".  Zzzzz.</p>

<p>There was a break from the somnolence while one of the delegates,
Tamkeen Zera Shah from Pakistan, organized an all-nations amateur
night.  I got to know Tamkeen a bit during the next couple days; she
joined the krewe at a coffeebreak or two.  Her little-girl voice,
schoolgirl glasses and demure manners fail to conceal a sharp and
observant mind.  She did a good job of recruiting singers, too: even
got me to do Pete Seeger's "Blue and Gray" as the American
contribution. As English was the conference working language, those
may have been the only lyrics everyone in the room understood.</p>

<p>Afterwards, the band actually played some dance music.  I learned
that Thais don't dance in pairs.  They proceed to the dance floor in
groups of at least four and dance in big circles, sloppy conga lines,
or amorphous pulsating blobs.  And they are almost without exception
lousy dancers by U.S. or European standards. In fact, they're so bad
that my lame-ass 44-year-old-white-geek-with-palsy moves make me
conspicuously one of the best dancers on the floor.  I get compliments
for this, a fact which boggles the hell out of my mind until I clue
into the fact that most of the healthy, half-my-age college students
around me are emitting all the sexual zorch of limp dishrags.</p>

<p>I think I'm detecting symptoms of serious inhibition in Thai
culture.  These college kids dress Western and can sing
English-language pop tunes in chorus, but they're timid in the extreme
about behaviors with any libidinal edge.  Not that the delegates from
elsewhere seem much more liberated, on the whole.  Is this an
all-Asian phenomenon, I wonder?  Very weird...</p>

<p>Next morning Jadamba Tsolmon rematerializes from the ASA
conference, having traveled two hours to get here.  Hugs all around;
we exchange email addresses.  Since it takes her two hours to shuttle
between conferences, she's unlikely to come back a third time,
alas.</p>

<p>Tuesday was the day of political bullshit, perhaps inevitable since
the day's topic was "Institutions and Social Justice".  I lost my
temper only once, after hearing two nut-fringe Islamic delegates that
I never identified accuse the U.S. of setting up the 9/11 bombing to
justify invading Afghanistan and using radioactive weapons on Iraqi
children. The other delegates, evidently recognizing paranoid fantasy
when they heard it, seemed anxious to forget the incident.</p>

<p>Tuesday night's events were offsite, after a long bus trip through
Bangkok.  One of the AYF staffers managing my bus, striding around
competently with walkie-talkie in hand, caught my eye; statuesque
women with long wavy black hair and flawless skin who look like
supermodels and dress in tight midriff-baring outfits tend to do that.
With some bemusement I realized that the thought of trying to talk to
her made me a bit nervous.  Some adolescent insecurities never die, I
guess.</p>

<p>Dinner was in the "Royal Thai Navy" military club.  I didn't
really see the point, since it was the same steam-table generic Thai
food we'd been eating back at the University -- quite good (Thai food
tolerates steam-tabling well) but hardly enough to cross town for.

<p>The view from the club balcony was pretty good, though.  In one
direction, the intricate roofs of the Royal Palace, fluted
and spiked and ridged and all over gold-leafed and floodlit to a
fare-thee-well.  In the other, the dark shimmer of the Chao Payar
River, with ornate high-prowed barges floating down it outlined in
lights.</p>

<p>After dinner we bussed over to Khao San Road, a notorious bazaar cum
tourist trap flanked by "guest houses" that seem to be divided between
cheap accomodations for the backpacking crowd and brothels.  The road
wears its reputation as the main drag of a red-light district so
brazenly that I imagine Thai city planners thinking "and over here,
the official rough-trade area for the round-eye tourists".  It's
noisy, crowded, lined with tacky neon, dirty, and the liveliest place
I've seen in Bangkok.</p>

<p>The street swarms with foreigners, souvenir hawkers, beggars, and
pimps.  One of the pimps, a skinny rodent-like little Thai with bad
skin, sidles up to me and offers me a brochure featuring pictures of
naked Thai girls.  Alas for him that I find the thought of sex with
any woman doing it for the money revolting; even if I didn't, AIDS is
so common here that I'd get my kicks above the waistline, Sunshine.
When I tell him I'm not interested, he asks me if I want a boy.  I
refrain from decking him; I suppose it's a reasonable question, from
his specialized point of view.</p>

<p>Just a few seconds later a posse of four pretty girls I recognize
from the AYF staff sweeps me up.  They ask me if I want to go dancing.
Replying in the affirmative, I find myself being borne off on a wave
of giggles to a relatively quiet little bar, and placed firmly at the
head of a tableful of chattering Thai college students.  They're all
selected from elite universities, thus with IQs generally in the
130-and-up range; their body language and eye movements have the
alertness of the intelligent.  Mostly women, and mostly rather pretty,
at least in the face.</p>
 
<p>Thai women tend to look, er, <em>unripe</em> by Western standards.
Like Taipei, and unlike Japan and Korea, there's a fairly severe curve
shortage here -- slim-hipped and small-breasted is the norm (OK, let's
be honest; damn near flat is the norm).  Delicate bone structure
tends to make their faces look childlike to Westerners, and the demure
body language their culture teaches doesn't help either.</p>

<p>By contrast, the few women with real figures look utterly gorgeous.
One of them is sitting on my right; she was in the party that snatched
me off the street, and is in fact the beautiful wavy-haired woman I had
noticed on the bus.  She answers to the nickname "Boom".  To my left,
a lovely, slender girl with equally glowing skin, classically Chinese
features, and (unfortunately) braces answers to "Gigg".  Gigg confirms
that her family is part of the ethnic-Chinese minority that runs most
of Thailand's mercantile economy.</p>

<p>Several memories fall into place in a new pattern. I ask Boom if
she's ethnic-Chinese too; she dimples and nods.  Eureka!  I've got the
template now; ethnic-Chinese have different eyes, a different bone
structure, more prominent cheekbones than ethnic-Thais.  They don't
look quite like Chinese from China; skin tone is subtly different and
the epicanthic fold tends to be less pronounced.  They're actually
rather better-looking, at least to me, than the Chinese of Taiwan.</p>

<p>Essentially all of the "Thai" women who have been catching my eye
for the last three days, I realize in retrospect, are ethnic-Chinese.
Martin later tells me that local folklore agrees with me; part-Chinese
girls are considered the most beautiful. Maybe it's because, unlike
the pure ethnic Thais, they don't tend to look barely pubescent even
into their twenties.</p>

<p>After forty minutes or so of sipping iced sodas and talking, one of
the girls further down the table notes that we've got to meet the bus
back in half an hour and suggests we dance if we're going to.  I pull
a weakly protesting but laughing Boom towards the dance floor; Gigg
and another girl ride our wake.</p>

<p>Booty-shaking ensues.  Boom is a better than average dancer by
local standards, but local standards remain low -- all three girls are
far too impressed by what I'm doing and try to imitate it.  Apparently
the idea of timing one's movements to rhythm is novel here.  So are
the forceful, interpretive display gestures common in European
clubs. When I work a martial arts move into the rhythm it evokes
gasps.  The girls' attempts to emulate my style are good-natured but a
bit timid.  Nevertheless a good time is had by all. There's something
to be said for the experience of having three pretty women cheering
and trying to imitate one on a mirror-ball-lit dance floor deep in the
Bangkok combat zone.</p>

<p>I sleep pretty soundly that night and oversleep the next morning.
Not that this is a problem, since everybody else was on the Khao San
expedition too and gets off to a similarly slow start.  The delegates
have broken up into interest sections to draft an action plan.  The
high point of my morning happens while looking for the venue of the IT
and Education interest section, on which Martin has asked me to sit
in.</p>

<p>Boom is the designated wielder-of-the-tape-recorder in one of the
section rooms.  I tell her she looks lovely this morning (a gross
understatement) and she smiles and says that just for that she will
record anything I say with extra care.  Alas, someone tells me 
I am in the wrong room.  I am not pleased.  Neither is Boom, who
compliments me by looking disappointed that I have to go.</p>

<p>(This is the woman my remnant insecurity tapes tried to tell me 
was unapproachable.  It's a good thing I've taught myself not to
listen to myself when I think things like that.)</p>

<p>There is not much for me to do the rest of the day.  Though I did
offer to help Qui Xiaofeng Lee (aka Mary) from Peking with her
English, and we quickly became friendly.  She was one of the two women
who get elected to represent our interest section at the final
roundup.  Because the shuttle vans had unaccountably stopped running,
we took the 20-minute walk back to the dorm together, getting
acquainted.  We never discuss politics, but what I learn about her
life and interests tells me that Chinese Communism is moribund.
Oddly, she seems rather more like a member in good standing of the
American-generated global youth culture than the Thais here, certainly
much more so than some of the Islamic delegates like Tamkeen.  Part of
this is body language; she makes eye contact and carries herself with
the easy sexual confidence of an American woman.</p>

<p>The evening is Fancy Night, a costume party. Delegates are
encouraged to wear national costume, but all kinds of others show up
too.  Star Wars characters, a couple of wizards and witches, and some
camo-clad soldiers make appearances.  Three girls show up in identical
vinyl hot pants and weird mutant sailor suits, probably as
characters from some anime I don't know about.</p>

<p>Sarah is magnificent in Kurdish tribal wear, gold-on-black
embroidered robes and a coin-fringe headdress.  Tamkeen looks elegant
in Pakistani dress, a simple black-and-orange robe.  Natalya has
improvised an attractive costume from a Thai-style braded headpiece
and wraparound dress she bought on Khao San Road.  Boom looks
ravishing in a sort of gold lame odalisque number.  I, having not been
informed of the protocol in advance, have nothing to wear.  I carry my
flute and tell people I am cleverly disguised as a musician.</p>

<p>In the front lobby of the conference center I encounter a Thai
in traditional dress who is carrying an acoustic guitar.  We jam on
a few songs and attract a small crowd.  Inside, buffet tables offer
a local version of dim sum, mixing Chinese and Thai dishes to good
effect.  The spicy pork buns are especially tasty.</p>

<p>Dinner is accompanied by more Thai traditional dance, then by a
mixed troupe of Korean dancers who do several numbers with costume
changes.  The most impressive features the five men in the troupe
wearing something like silver lame zoot suits.  Accompanied by
pounding rock music and strobe-lit, they do a routine that is
fast, athletic, testosterone-charged, savagely intense.  I have
never seen such unequivocally <em>male</em> dancing before.</p>

<p>After the dancers everybody's favorite Thai wedding band retakes
the stage and proceeds to play pretty much the same set as two nights
previous (though we are mercifully spared "Play That Funky Music" this
time).  This time, however, the Thais and foreign delegates and AYF
staffers on the dance floor behave rather less like clueless
13-year-olds at their first sock hop.  Everybody is a little looser.
Actual rhythmic motion occurs, and there are sporadic outbreaks of pair
dancing.  Zounds!  Discussing this with Martin the next morning, I
propose that Thais are less inhibited when they're not wearing their
own clothes.  Martin agrees this is plausible.</p>

<p>During one of these outbreaks I slow-dance with Boom, a deeply
pleasant experience that ends much too soon.  She is without a doubt
the most beautiful woman I have met in Thailand, and actually one of
the more attractive I have ever met anywhere. She doesn't know that I
have voted for her in the best-costume contest, nor that I am
suppressing a mad urge to make a pass at her.  I'm married, I don't know
the courtship rules here, I'm flying home tomorrow, and she would
deserve more than a one-night stand anyway.  Ah, the hazards of
travel.</p>

<p>Sometime in mid-evening Tamkeen tells me she's done for the night
and is going back to the dorm.  I hug her and tell her she'll be
welcome in my home if she ever visits the U.S.  A few minutes later I
discover that there is in fact at least one really good dancer in
Thailand, another AYF staffer nicknamed Jik who is resplendent in
Hindu costume.  She has has better moves than Boom and is quite pretty
in her own right, though she doesn't light up my limbic system in
quite the same way.  We play well together, managing some neat 
spins during a couple of fast dances; her delighted smile is worth
remembering.</p>

<p>Music Club's second set finishes up, or perhaps just stalls out,
around 11PM.  While I'm wandering around looking for Boom so I can
give her my email address, I run into the guitarist I had played with
earlier.  He has partially unshipped his costume, which includes a
Thai sword shaped something like a Japanese wakizashi but with a long,
elaborately turned wooden hilt.  It's a country weapon, crudely made
but quite serviceable.  When he sees me admiring it he makes a gift of
it to me, explaining that he bought it for the costume and can get
another for 100 baht (about $3).  I thank him for his generosity.
I'll hang it on my wall at home; it will go nicely with the ritual
masks and old maps and hieroglyphic Egyptian papyri.</p>

<p>Next morning the other speakers and delegates pile on buses for a
cultural tour, which I can't take because I have to fly out at noon to
be in Baltimore on the evening of the 24th.  Martin and I go back to
the noodle stand instead for a good hot Thai breakfast.  During the
hour-long drive to the airport we talk of things Thai and other. I
hear the story of his Thai mother and German father, who met while
they were working for an airline in Bangkok. Martin, half-Western and
raised in Germany, has a more objective view of Thai custom than a
native would likely be able to manage.</p>

<p>It's good to be heading home again, but I won't mind coming back to
Thailand if AYF wants the road show again next year.  It's a gentle
country.  The place has good food, beautiful women, and there are
thousand-year-old Buddhist temples to hang out in. What more could
one ask for?</p>
