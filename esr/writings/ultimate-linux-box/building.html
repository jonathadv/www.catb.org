>Dreaming about hot hardware is fun, but it's just mental masturbation
unless you actually build and test the design in the real world.
Fortunately I was able to do this.  Gary Sandine and John Pearson, the
principals at <A
HREF="http://www.laclinux.com/"
TARGET="_top"
>Los Alamos
Computers</A
>, undertook to assemble my Ultimate Linux Box -- in fact,
they volunteered to build two, one for me and one for Linus Torvalds.  They
solicited the vendors on our list for donations of parts, and their courage
was rewarded when IBM generously volunteered $15,000 for the project
budget.</P
><P
>I flew out to LAC's headquarters in early August.  Gary and John had
managed to pull together almost all the parts on amazingly short notice;
the only things missing from the prototype were the Silverado cooler and
the Diamond Pro monitor -- the former is in low-volume production and
wasn't to be available for another week, and the latter is being shipped
direct to my house to mimize the risk of transit damage.  For the machine's
acceptance tests we temporarily substituted another monitor with
2048x1536 capability, and two generic PC coolers.  The tummy.com folks
overnighted us CD-ROMs for the August KRUD distribution, then just
three days old.</P
><P
>Plugging the wires together presented no great challenge.  Remember
to plug the digital cable from the DVD-ROM into the CD port on the
SB Live! card.  The disk activity pins on the motherboard fire on either
IDE or SCSI activity, so do wire them to your front-panel light.</P
><P
>Installing the Silverados is a bit of a challenge if you're
inexperienced, however.  The installation directions aren't bad, but they
don't emphasis the first step enough; you need to slip the short end of the
spring bracket around the lug on one side of the processor far enough that
it catches firmly underneath before you try pressing down the other, long
end of the spring bracket.  Also note that you will need to run the
Silverados at 8 volts rather than the minimum 6, as otherwise the heat
shutoff in the 760 chipset won't believe they are spinning fast enough and
will shut the machine down.</P
><P
>Actually, the Silverados turn out to be enough of a pain that we're 
probably going to have to fall back to a PC cooler that is less vulnerable
to shipping damage and can be preinstalled.</P
><P
>Our first serious systems-integration problem was with the graphics
card -- the ATI Radeon support in XFree86 4.0.1, it turns out, doesn't play
nice with the S2462 chipset.  If you enable the Radeon's acceleration, it
will throw complete garbage on an X display.  Then, when you return to text
mode by killing the X server, you get a black screen of death. Turning off
the Radeon's acceleration works around the problem but loses you much of
the benefit of this expensive card.</P
><P
>It developed that there's a known timing problem in the Radeon driver,
which the extreme speed of the Athlons exacerbates; Darryl found us a
one-line patch, which worked (it's supplied later in this article).
XFree86 4.2 should have issued, with this patch included long before this
article reaches print (the fix is already in the XFree86 CVS; I sent it to
Red Hat and it has been accepted for their 7.2 release).</P
><P
>Installation of KRUD went smoothly -- and very quickly, just 18
minutes for an `everything' install (that 40x read speed on the DVD-ROM
came in handy, though the media were almost uncomfortably warm afterwards).</P
><P
>Then we tested audio.  The SB Live! seemed to work with the stock
emu10k1.o sound module in Red Hat 7.1, but as it turns out it can't run the
earphone out jack on the LiveDrive.  Under the emu10k1 driver we were able
to successfully burn a CD while listening to another one (the Jimi Hendrix
<I
CLASS="CITETITLE"
>Kiss the Sky</I
> compilation, as it happens).  The card
can also run with the ALSA drivers, but they can't run the earphone jack
either.</P
