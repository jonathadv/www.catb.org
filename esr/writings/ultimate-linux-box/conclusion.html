><P
>I find it impressive that, after having specified it on a
cost-is-no-object basis, the the total system cost is nevertheless so low.
I tried hard to gold-plate as much of the system as possible and load on
all the extras and accessories I could, and was nevertheless 
unable to raise the total parts bill over $7000.</P
><P
>It is also interesting that so little of the cost is in the system
core.  The motherboard, memory, case, cooler and drives are only a hair
over $3200 of the total.  If we discarded the most extravagant peripherals
-- dumping the Klipsch speakers and the Radeon and the DVD and DDS drives,
the cost would drop to a quite reasonable $4200 or so.  Rick Moen observes
pungently that "People pay more than that for crap computers every
day."</P
><P
>You could build the ULB yourself from scratch.  But, unless you're
either a very experienced hardware hacker or seriously enough interested in
having a learning experience to accept possibly trashing some expensive
parts, maybe you shouldn't (I wouldn't).  There are subtle gotchas that can
cost you a lot of grief.  A good example, Gary tells me, is installing PC
coolers -- if you're inexperienced, it's pretty easy to use too much
pressure and damage the CPU socket, or even to crack the CPU itself.</P
><P
>This design will be available for purchase from Los Alamos Computers
as the ULB-200108 (that is, the August 2001 edition of the Ultimate Linux
Box).  If you buy it from them rather than assembling it yourself, you'll
save yourself a lot of time and get a machine that has been assembled by a
pro, unit-tested and is warranted.  You'll also, of course, get the latest
Linux pre-installed and pre-customized for the hardware.</P
><P
>One mechanical gotcha with this design is that a machine with
Silverados in it can't be sent through the mail. There is a silver disc
(actual silver, the most heat-conductive metal there is) at the bottom of
the heat sink which will be damaged by vibrations during shipping if the
Silverado is installed. So you'll have to do the final assembly of this bit
yourself even if you buy from LAC.  Fortunately the vendor provides
detailed instructions.</P
><P
>And how fast does it build kernels?  After `make clean', the Ultimate
Linux Box builds the ULB's 2.4.9 Linux kernel from a cold standing start
(<B

>make -j 'MAKE=make -j' dep; make -j 'MAKE=make -j'
