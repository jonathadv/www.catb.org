><P
>In July 2001 the clear standout choice for a ULB
motherboard is the Tyan Thunder K7, model S2462 -- brand-spanking-new
technology and the only dual-Athlon board in production.  This baby is the
cutting edge in PC board design, and a good indicator of where board design
will be going in the next twelve months to three years.</P
><P
>Why only 1200MHz Athlons rather than Intel's 1800MHz P-IV?  Two
reasons.  One: the P-IV doesn't yet have hooks for multiprocessor
operation.  Linux is good enough at SMP that two 1200s would beat a single
1800 if the chip architectures were the same.  But, two: the P-IV is a dog.
Its cache system is badly misdesigned, and various reviewers have shown
that under common job loads it's actually slower than a P-III!</P

but the short version is that this board should have "Born To Run Linux"
stenciled on it in day-glo orange.  Every single piece of hardware on it
with a software API is well-supported by the stock 2.4 kernel.</P
><P
>There are good and bad consequences of having your peripherals on
board like this.  The good one is that you're cutting the amount of glue
logic and connectors in the machine. This means the board has fewer points
of failure, and will throw less heat and radio noise.  While radio noise is
no more than a nuisance, we've observed previously that thermal stress is
the main enemy of component life -- and given the large amounts of heat
thrown off by today's processors this is a serious issue today in a way it
wasn't in 1996.  Several of the decisions we'll make further on are aimed
at reducing the temperature inside the case.</P
><P
>The downside of integration is that it makes fault recovery more
difficult.  You want to minimize the chance that a failure in one on-board
component will require an immediate motherboard swap.  So it's reassuring
to discover from the S2462 manual that all the on-board peripheral chips
except the IDE controller can be jumpered out.  The IDE controller can be
disabled from the BIOS setup screens, a good thing to do as it frees up
some IRQs.</P
><P
>Now for another upside -- this board is available (unpopulated) for
just $499 on the net, quantity 1!  This is an astonishing price given the
amount of stuff integrated onto the board.</P
><P
>A final downside, for some people: while the Athlon itself
is relatively easy to overclock, this board has no overclocking options
(there are no jumpers or accesses to control the clock multiplier).  We
don't care, but there are hackers in the world who value raw processor
performance over stability so much that they just don't feel right 
running their processors at merely the rated speed.</P
><P
>Two vendors have been qualified by Tyan to build high-density memory
for this board; Kentron and Smart.  Smart's stuff is slightly cheaper, but
we go with Kentron because they use non-stacking DIMM modules to avoid
thermal hot-spot problems.  Since we're going to stick with the 2GB maximum
Tyan tells us they have qualified with the board, we can use their 512MB
modules.</P

NAME="AEN227">Choosing a Case</H2
><P
>Most people reflexively evaluate computer cases just by their
physical size (small is good if you want to fit it on top of a desk) and
their expansion capacity (mainly the number of drive bays).  But internal
expansion space isn't very important any more, not when two half-height
drive bays will hold your two SCSI spindles and more disk storage than
you'll ever need.  External slots are more important; let's count them.
With current technology you want two hard disk bays (hidden), one CD-ROM, one
tape, one floppy, and perhaps a DVD drive.  That's one exposed half-height
3.5" bay, three exposed half-height 5.25" bays, and two hidden
half-height 5.25" bays.  Even many mini-tower cases have
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>that</I
> much capacity!</P
><P
>There are several other things you want from a case that are just as
important.  Three are good airflow design, component accessibility, and
noise attenuation (in that order).  Attenuation of radio-frequency noise
can matter too if you're going to use a computer near other electronics
(such as the boom box I listen to Joe Satriani on whilst hacking), but you
should get this for free if you specify a good-quality steel or aluminum
case.  Finally, you may also want your case to look neat.</P
><P
>Good airflow design is actually the best reason to buy a large case.
You want there to be plenty of room for cool air to flow around the
heat-generating electronics.  This doesn't mean you should make a habit of
running your computer with the case off, however.  Without the ducting
effect of the case, the fans may not force enough airflow to keep your
electronics safely cooled.</P
><P
>One of the S2462's few drawbacks is that at 13x12" it's larger
than a normal ATX board.  This constrains our choices.  Tyan's site lists
cases that have been mechanically qualified with the board, so I shopped
around for a full tower on that list.  Most of the cases were pretty
generic stuff being pumped out by Taiwanese companies with garish Web pages
festooned with broken English and cheesy Javascript; I rejected them
because if their websites were that bad their technical documentation
seemed likely to be worse.  One vendor, Palo Alto Products, looked like a
classier act but is clearly geared to high-volume orders from OEMs and
contract manufacturers (they make cases for Dell and Micron).</P
><P
>The vendor I went back to was Antec.  Antec's <A
HREF="http://www.antec-inc.com/product/cases/perfhome.html"
TARGET="_top"
>Performance
Series</A
> offers a number of cases that Tyan qualifies, ranging from
mini-towers up to caster-mounted oversized server cases.  The swing-out
side panel and quick-release drive bays featured on all of these appealed
to me.  Reviewers consistently described Antec as solid hardware with
excellent airflow and cooling properties, and easy to work with (apparently
they are quite popular among overclockers).  My interest was especially
caught by one measurement that with two Antec-provided fans the SX800's
external noise level remains under 35dBA.  Given that these are probably
cheap sleeve-bearing fans, the case attenuates about 8dB.</P
><P
>When the design evolved to include both the front panel controls for
a sound card and a DVD player, the three exposed 5.25" bays on the
SX800 weren't enough any more.  I went with the SX1200, the full-tower
version with seven exposed bays. There is a <A

NAME="AEN238">Power Supply and Cooling</H2
><P
>For the power supply, the three of us easily agreed on a vendor:
<A
HREF="http://www.pcpowercooling.com/prices/index.htm"
TARGET="_top"
>PC Power &#38;
Cooling</A
>.  A lot of people treat power supplies as a commodity, so
many interchangeable silver bricks.  We know better -- cheap power supplies
go bad, and when they go bad they have a nasty habit of taking out the
delicate electronics they're feeding.  PCP&#38;C has a reputation for making
good ones -- and, as a bonus, <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>quiet</I
> ones.  The company
rates its supplies in decibels as well as wattage and boasts that its
"Silencer" series puts out less than a tenth the noise of a typical generic
power supply.</P
><P
>Sadly, the rated wattage of their heaviest-duty Silencer tops out
well below the 460W that Tyan recommends.  However, PCP&#38;C justified our
confidence when they told me of their brand-new 450A4 unit. This is a
variant of their rock-solid TurboCool 450ATX power supply specifically
designed for use with the Tyan TY 2462, and so new that it didn't have a
spec page of its own on the PCP&#38;C site yet. It's a nice warm fuzzy
feeling  to know the board and power supply are properly matched. And at
44dBA, the A4 counts as pretty quiet.</P
><P
>Next, we'll tackle the CPU's own cooler -- the fan/heat-sink
combination that sits directly on modern hot-running processors and keeps
them from melting down their own silicon (the maximum operating temperature
for Athlons is 95°C).  In May 2001, Tom's Hardware site did an article
on <A
HREF="http://www6.tomshardware.com/cpu/01q2/010521/index.html"
TARGET="_top"
>Extreme cooling</A
>.  In it, they compare 46 PC coolers. The article
tellingly notes: "AMD's new Athlon processors above 1200 MHz practically
beg for a powerful cooling system. Using a cheap generic cooler is just not
worthwhile in that scenario."</P
><P
>The four critical statistics of a CPU cooler are (1) weight, (2)
cooling capacity, (3) dBA of emitted noise, and (4) price.  For our
purposes, we don't care about weight or price.  We care a lot about cooling
capacity, and Tom's Hardware confirms that our choice can make a huge
difference.  Running AMD Athlons at 1000MHz, a configuration close to ours,
they found a difference of 24 degrees Celsius (43 degrees Fahrenheit)
between generic coolers and the best of breed (the actual range was
54°C to 30°C).</P
><P
>Tom's Hardware evaluated 46 coolers and found a clear standout: the
Silverado from Noise Control, Inc.  They rated it best in cooling
performance at 30°C and second-best in noise emission at only 37dBA.
That's pretty good, since typical coolers emit about 50dBA; one reviewer
commented that the Silverado is so quiet that it's hard to tell it's
running.  The Silverado's only real drawback is that it's large -- 80mm
long, 56mm wide, 113mm high -- so you need to be careful about case
clearances.  Fortunately our Antec case is plenty roomy.</P
><P
>So far, our design has two fans -- the PC cooler and the
power-supply's internal fan (which draws air out of the machine).
Experience shows this isn't enough.  With generic power supplies, it's
unwise to count on the power-supply fan doing more than venting the heat
that the power supply itself generates.  PCP&#38;C's are engineered to do
better, but smart system builders will treat that as safety margin and
deploy at least two additional case fans anyway.</P
><P
>We can learn from the overclockers here.  One <A
HREF="http://www.heatsink-guide.com/"
TARGET="_top"
>guide to case airflow and
cooling</A
> teaches that setting up a good cross-draft inside the
machine with a few fans is better than having lots of fans just stirring
the case atmosphere.  One simple but effective deployment features just
two case fans: one placed near the power supply at the rear and helping it
pull air out of the machine, and another at the front vent pulling outside
air into the case.</P
><P
>We can avoid having our case fans add more than a bare minimum to
the machine's decibel output by specifying cooling fans that, like the
fan in the A4 power supply, have ball bearings rather than the cheaper and
more common sleeve bearings (<A
HREF="http://www.papstplc.com/"
TARGET="_top"
>Papst</A
> is one of the better-known quality
brands).  This will cut machine noise by an appreciable degree, especially
the annoying ringing or whining high-frequency component (which is mostly
bearing noise).</P
><P
>PC Power and Cooling, as it turns out, makes 20dBA <A
HREF="http://www.pcpowercooling.com/products/alarmandaccesories/silencerfan/index.htm"
TARGET="_top"
>Silencer</A
> 80-millimeter ball-bearing case fans that are matched to
their power supplies.  If you order these, be sure to specify the three-pin
connectors (so they can be driven off the motherboard fan headers) rather
than the conventional 4-pin connectors (meant to be plugged direct into the
power supply).</P
><P
>Ideally, we'd like our case fans to have a so-called "tach wire" 
that reports the fan's speed back to the motherboard, so we can monitor
for failing fans.  The S2462, like most motherboards designed for
server applications, has fan-monitoring headers on it.  Unfortunately,
tach-wired fans tend to be heavy-duty, noisy models designed for server
use.  PCP&#38;P makes them, but they have 40dBA noise output.</P

NAME="AEN256">Mass Storage</H2
><P
>Disk storage is a topic much dearer to the typical hacker's heart.
Since we've chosen SCSI, it's also a lot simpler -- SCSI parts tend to be
good quality, and the SCSI standard is strong enough that card vs. drive
interoperability problems are extremely rare (not unknown, though; they can
pop up in SCSI RAID configurations, which is one reason we're not
RAIDing).</P
><P
>We know we're going to be specifying fast-wide LVD drives that can
handle the 160MB/sec that the S2462's controller pumps out.  Within that
class, the important statistics are seek time, rotational latency,
capacity, heat dissipation, and noise output.  Mean time between failure is
long enough on the leading brands that you're quite unlikely to see one
before your system is years obsolete (provided you don't lose it to a bad
power supply or a lightning strike).  In accordance with the discussion in
the first part of this article, we'll make a basic design choice to put
good seek time first.</P
><P
>I went to the <A
HREF="http://storagereview.com"
TARGET="_top"
>storagereview.com</A
> site, which
collects statistics and reviews on leading disk drives, and selected five
well-known brand-name 160MB SCSI drives.  There I was able to get data on
seek time and disk RPM (which predicts rotational latency), but not
heat-dissipation figures.</P
><P
>Heat-dissipation figures for SCSI drives, it turns out, are hard to
come by.  I searched the Web diligently for systematic comparisons without
success.  One thing Rick Moen and I do know from experience (and which is
confirmed by Web reviews) is that Seagate SCSI drives tend to run
particularly hot.  That's a useful warning, since they're the default 
brand for a lot of people.</P
><P
>My storagereview.com search confirmed more anecdotal evidence from
Rick.  He likes IBM's current product line, the UltraStar.  With a 4.2ms
seek time, they edge ahead of competition from Seagate, Quantum, and
Fujitsu.  Rick believes they run relatively cool, too, and we hear they
smoked the competition in some comparative trials run by Evi Nemeth at the
CAIDA project.  So we'll add two <A

TARGET="_top"
>IBM UltraStar
36Z15</A
> drives to the parts list.</P

>We want to be able to read (and write) CD-ROMs, too.  Once again
storageview.com confirms Rick Moen's anecdotal report, tapping the 32-speed

> as the best-of-breed among SCSI CD-RW drives.</P
><P
>Rick observes: "CD-R/CD-RW drives, by their nature have head
assemblies much more massive than those of ordinary read-only CD drives.
(Why?  Because they mount <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>burn</I
> lasers.)  Much greater
mass means much greater inertia, and much faster mechanical wear -- and the
considerable heat generated during burn cycles also takes its toll.
Accordingly, the MTBF times for CDR/CDRW drives are markedly shorter than
for regular CD drives.  One should <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>not</I
> use CDR/CDRW
drives for mundane read operations, but rather just for CD-burning.
Accordingly, if you really have need for a CDR or CDRW drive, you
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>also</I
> need a second, read-only drive for everyday
CD-reading."</P
><P
>Daryll chimes in with: "Buy a DVD-ROM, rather than an ordinary
CD-ROM. Typically the transfer rates are just as good if not better
(because the base DVD rotational speed is higher to begin with)."</P
><P
>While meditating on Daryll's remarks I realized that a DVD is a
must-have for another reason; any true dream system for a Linux hacker
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>must</I
> include the ability to violate the anti-fair-use
clauses of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act by running DeCSS on a daily
basis -- even if (like me) the hacker is basically uninterested in DVDs per
se.  It's ethically imperative.</P
><P
>I gave brief consideration to DVD-R, DVD-RAM, and DVD-RW, the
technologies bidding to succeed DVD-ROM by adding various levels of
rewritability to the medium.  But these would have the same problem of
higher thermal load and mechanical wear that motivated us to install an
alternative to the CD-RW driver. And none is yet established as a
standard, so we could end up carrying that load for nothing.  We'll
stick with DVD-ROM for this system.</P
><P
>It appears there are presently just two models of SCSI DVD-ROM
available, the 304S/305S by Pioneer and the SD-M1201B by Toshiba.  The
Toshiba is 5X as a DVD drive and 32X as a CD-ROM drive; the Pioneer's
numbers are 10X and 40X.  Easy call, especially as the Toshiba is actually
more expensive. <A

>Despite diligent searching, I was unable to find good comparative
information on DDS4 drives on the Web.  When you can't find objective
reviews, fall back on history -- and history says that the top-of-line
Hewlett-Packard tape drive is either going going to be the best of breed or
very close.  The top of line HP DDS4 drive appears to be the <A

circuitry on my motherboard. I've never had an external modem contribute to
my system box's heat load.  I've never been unable to power-cycle an
external modem without rebooting the attached system.  (Of course, many
people reboot their machines every time the computer sneezes, so one more
reboot passes without notice.  But when we are no longer children, we put
away childish operating systems.)  I've never had an external modem prevent
me from debugging serial-port-support problems separately from modem
issues.  I've never had an external modem be unable to be used on a
different chip architecture, or PC with the wrong set of busses.  I've
never had an external modem create RFI problems inside my system box."</P

particular mistake over a decade ago.  External modems clearly win.  Next

NAME="INTEGRATION">System Integration</H2
><P
>A computer is not just a bag of parts.  We also need to give some
consideration to how we'll assemble them for best use.  The high degree of
integration on our motherboard will make the assembly of this system
relatively simple; nevertheless, there are a couple of un-obvious places
where a little forethought and intelligence will avoid problems later
on.</P
><P
>We have two SCSI controllers.  That's good, because we also have both
LVD and single-ended SCSI devices in our parts list.  Daryll observes: "LVD
drives can drive the bus at 40MHz and 80MHz, whereas single ended can
not. If you mix single ended and LVD, the bus degrades to single ended. So,
a bus with a single ended device tops out at 20MHz Wide SCSI or 40MB/s
whereas LVD gets you up to 160MB/s."  Thus, we want to assemble the dream
machine with two SCSI chains -- a high-speed wide/LVD chain for the hard
drives and tape, and a low-speed narrow/single-end chain for the CD-RW and
DVD-ROM.</P
><P
>Note that there are two ways to support the 50-pin narrow SCSI.  One
is with an adapter on each device, so that you run 68-pin cables off the
motherboard for both channels, and one with an adapter that sits on the
motherboard and converts the motherboard cable header.  The issue here is
that the 68-pin connector has to be on channel 0 because the boot device is
a disk; fortunately, the header for the second SCSI channel does in fact
have clearance for the connector. We used an SM-20 from <A
HREF="http://www.tmcscsi.com/adapters/newprodlist.html"
TARGET="_top"
>The Mate
Company</A
>.</P
><P
>A little planning can also help us avoid hot spots inside the case by
spacing the components carefully.  Because the hard drives are likely to be
significant heat generators, we should mount them with the Antec case's
spare internal bay between them, rather than stacking them in vertically
adjacent drive bays.  That way we'll get better airflow around them, and
better cooling.</P
><P
>The Antec case actually makes it possible to mount the intake fan
directly in front of the drive bay housing the hard disks.  This makes a
major difference in their operating temperature.  Normally, with drives
in this class, the drives and the bay enclosure become uncomfortably hot
to the touch; with this setup, the warmth is barely noticeable.  This is
a Good Thing -- it probably extends the expected lifetime of the drives
by a significant factor.  We ended up mounting a third case fan because
we noticed the memory chips seemed to be running pretty hot.</P
><P
>We'll have two expansion cards in the machine, the SB Live! and the
Radeon.  The Radeon will probably tend to run hot, the SB not.  Happily,
the hot-running Radeon lives in the AGP slot at the upper end of the slot
row, where the convective plume of heated air it generates will be sucked
into the two rear fans rather than heating up the sound card and the air
over the motherboard.  We can put the SB Live! at the lower end of the slot
row, separating these two heat sources.</P
><P
>How does our noise budget look?  IBM says our UltraStars emit 48dBA
each, PCP&#38;C says the power supply emits 44dBA and the fans 20dBA each,
and Tom's Hardware rated the Silverado at 37dBA (but there are 2).
Applying the logarithmic-sum formula gives us 52dBA as the level of
interior noise.  Assuming the case blocks 8dB, that will leave us with an
exterior noise level adjacent to the case of 44dBA.  Not too bad, given
that we can trim another 5dB or so by putting the machine
desk-side.</P
><P
>It's also useful to recalculate with four or five case fans and 
observe that this barely nudges the second decimal place in the
total.  This means that in case our initial burn-in reveals a heat
problem (which we can pick up through the S2462's on-board thermal
sensor) we've got headroom to cool things down without making the 
machine substantially noisier.</P
><P
>Each cooler comes with 4 cork pads, about 1" square each, to be
installed underneath the CPU area of the motherboard to eliminate vibration
noise from the cooler..  The instructions say to stack pads until they're
about 1mm higher than the size of the standoff that the motherboard is
mounted on, and then attach to the bottom of the mobo under each CPU (they
have peel off backs, and stick by themselves).</P
><P
>Also note that the motherboard needs to see a minimum voltage load on
the headers for the processor fans before it will do its power-on self test
-- this is a server-oriented safety feature to prevent it from melting
itself down if the fans crap out.  So you actually need to run the fans off
those headers rather than direct from the power supply.</P
><P
>We'll get some noise-reduction help from the design of the Antec
case.  Instead of being screwed directly to the frame, the case fans sit in
plastic cradles with lugs that snap-fit into various locations in the case
walls.  The intervening plastic will tend to damp the vibrations from the
fan motor so they don't make the case resonate.  In a more conventional
enclosure, we'd be well advised to stand the case fans off the case with
rubber washers.</P
><P
>We've been warned by someone with experience that if you have more
than one case fan (which you will always need at these heat levels) make
sure the fans have different RPMs &#8212; otherwise they're correlated
sources, and you can get beat-frequency effects that will raise the total dBA
output and drive you insane.  With 20dBA fans, however, this may not
be an issue -- even if they're perfectly correlated the peak noise output
couldn't crack a quieter-than-a-whisper 26dBA.</P
><P
>We'll listen and feel for case resonance -- vibrations produced by
fan or drive motors and transmitted through the case frame could cause the
case's outer walls to vibrate in sympathy, producing a rattling or
chattering sound.  If this happens, a quick fix would be to lay a thick
X-shaped bead of ordinary window putty on the interior of the vibrating
surface; because they're inelastically coupled, the putty will tend to
damp the vibrations, though it won't absorb any significant amount
of sound.</P
><P
>A more drastic possibility to consider along similar lines would be
gluing acoustic foam to the inner case walls (the door side away from the
motherboard is an especially good candidate for this).  Beware of heat
buildup, though; acoustic foam absorbs sound by thermalizing it and is a
good heat insulator, so you're going to raise the interior temperature a
bit if you do this.  You need foam that won't combust even in the
high-temperature worst case that all the fans and the cooler crap out while
the machine is running, otherwise you have a fire hazard (you also need
foam that won't outgas noxious vapors when heated).  For similar reasons,
do <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>not</I
> try using acoustic hard-drive enclosures with
15000-rpm drives -- they run much too hot for these.</P
><P
>When I specified the Antec 1200 case, I was a little concerned
that it might be overkill, larger than the amount of stuff inside it
really justified.  As it turns out, the density of various cables
running around the machine (two SCSI chains plus a floppy cable plus
three fan wires plus two audio connections to the soundcard, plus the
ribbon cable from the sound card to its front panel, and I'm probably
forgetting something) is high enough that it's probably a very good
thing I didn't pick anything smaller.  It's worth noting that you're
likely to underestimate the amount of interior room you need when
designing your own system.</P
><P
>Gary comments: "One of the things that takes the longest for each
system we build is taking great care with cabling.  It's true in any
system, especially one like the ULB.  A sloppy cabling job can cause
case fans to be ineffective -- picture hot air trapped in regions
blocked off by ribbon cable.  As it is, we have clear passage from the
front case fans over the hard drives and memory and CPUs out the back,
aided by the rear fan.  We maintain this with the larger LVD cable by
paying attention to routing and bundling excess."</P

>The Antec SX1200 version isn't advertised on their website; it's

Substantial discounts (up to 30% on some of the peripherals) are
usually available through a bit of Web searching.  Or, better yet, the
nice people at Los Alamos Computers will build one for you...see below.</P
