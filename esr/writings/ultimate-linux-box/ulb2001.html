>This article is a sequel to my 1996 "Building the Perfect
	Box" article.  Where that was a guide to building Linux
	workstations on the cheap, this examines a slightly different
        question: What do you build when money is no object?</P

NAME="INTRO">Introduction</H1
><P
>Five years ago, in a <I
CLASS="CITETITLE"
>Linux Journal</I
> article I
wrote during 1996, I developed a recipe for an elegant and economical Linux
box.  I used this as motivation for a discussion of what makes a good
balanced system design.  The article became one of the most popular in LJ's
history, so the editors have invited me back for a second round.</P
><P
>This time, however, we're going to involve more people than just me.
LJ recruited Rick Moen, author of some well-known FAQs on modems and other
hardware topics, to assist with this article.  Daryll Strauss, the man
behind the famous all-Linux rendering farm used in the movie "Titanic",
also contributed sage advice coming from his background in graphics and
extreme data crunching.</P
><P
>Also, we're going to examine system architecture from a different
perspective.  Instead of going for economy we're going to go for the
balls-out maximum crunching power.  This time, we're going to ask not what
the most cost-effective plan is, but how to get the absolute highest
performance out of hardware we can live with.</P
><P
>"Hardware you can live with" means a machine that is stable, easy to
troubleshoot and inexpensive to maintain after the original
money-is-no-object build phase.  It should be small and low-maintainance
enough enough to live beside your desk, as opposed to (say) some
liquid-cooled monstrosity that needs to be nursed by a full-time
technician.  It should be, in short, a PC -- an extraordinary gold-plated
hand-tuned hotrod of a PC but a PC nevertheless.  Another important aspect of
liveability is level of emitted acoustic noise and heat; we'll be paying
attention to minimizing both as we design.</P
><P
>We'll stick with Intel hardware.  Alphas are fast and have that
wonderful sexy 64-bit architecture with enough symmetrical registers to
make an old compiler jock like me drool copiously, but the line has just
been sold to Intel and seems all too likely to be end-of-lifed in favor of
the Itanium before long.  The PowerPC has earned its fans, too --
considered in isolation, I like that chip a lot better than any Intel
architecture.  But PC hardware has all the advantages of the biggest
market; it's the easiest to get serviced and least expensive to upgrade,
and thus scores high on the hardware-you-can-live-with scale.</P
><P
>The "ultimate Linux box" that we showcase as a result will, of
course, inevitably fall behind the leading edge within months.  But walking
through the process of developing the ULB should will teach you things
about system design and troubleshooting that you can continue applying long
after the hardware in this article has become obsolete.</P
