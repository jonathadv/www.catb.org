<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Ultimate Linux Box update page</H1>

<p>It is February 2002 as I write.  In the months since the <a
href="ulb2001.html">Ultimate Linux Box</a> article I have collected a
few observations and revisions.  Later this year I'll probably do a
full revision; in the mean time, here are the salient points:</p>

<H2>The system core has performed extremely well</H2>

<p>The choice of the S2462 motherboard and UltraStar drives drives
appears to have been quite sound.  The machine is extremely fast and
responsive.  It has so much raw processor power and I/O bandwidth that
response is unimpaired even during heavy operations such as kernel
compiles.</p>

<H2>The SB Live! has been a continuing locus of problems</H2>

<p>The sound card gave us a lot of grief during the qualification tests.
It gave me grief afterwards, too.  In December I tried to install a
radio card.  While rebuilding the kernel to support it, I somehow
lost the ability to play CDs to my speakers -- and was never able
to regain it, despite restoring my original configuration and despite
a lot of high-powered technical help (including advice from the
driver maintainer).</p>

<p>The Linux support for the SB Live! seems to be fragile and flaky.
Troubleshooting it turned into a significant time sink and frustration
source.  In late January I finally got fed up and replaced it with a
no-name PCI sound card.  Later, the SB Live! went back in, but I'm 
now nervous about even upgrading my OS for fear the sound configuration
will break again.</p>

<H2>The Antec enclosure was a good call, but...</H2>

<p>The roominess and good design of the Antec 1200 case has helped
keep the hassles involved in swapping sound cards, etc. to a minimum.
But I might not use it in the next iteration, because...</p>

<H2>...the machine is too noisy</H2>

<p>The noise-control engineering in the design initially seemed like a
success, but normal wear on the fan and disk bearings seems to have
partially undone all that effort.  After six months of wear the
machine is getting loud.</p>

<p>I've gone back and forth on whether we could address this problem
by redesigning the cooling system, perhaps going to something like
water-cooling or Peltiers.  Water-cooling is likely to require a case
designed around it.</p>

<p>Examining the results of varying the decibel output of each part
suggested that the only way to cut noise significantly is to quiet the
noisiest part -- theoretically the disk drives.  But empirical
investigation (putting my ear to the parts) suggests that my dB figures
are wrong and the case fans are in fact the problem.</p>

<p>So now I'm looking into ways to (a) decouple the drives from the
case via elastomeric shock mounting, (b) prevent case resonance
with acoustic foam, and (c) water-cool to get rid of the case-fan
noise (water pumps can be <em>very</em> quiet).</p>

<p>We could add a big hard drive cooler to the disk drives to damp some
vibrations, thus cutting the noise.</p>

<H2>Towards the ULB 2002</H2>

<p>The ULB has already been upgraded to 1800 K7s from the original
1200s. This is the 2468 refresh of the 2462 motherboard, now in full
production.  Unlike its predecessor it can take 4GB rather than just
2GB of memory. Its only near competition seems to be the highest-end
Asus motherboards.</p>

<p>Recent results from StorageReview.com suggest that the Seagate
Cheetah X15-36LP (36.7 GB Ultra160/m SCSI) and Fujitsu MAM3367 (36 GB
Ultra160/m SCSI) have overtaken the IBM UltraStar in performance.  The
Cheetah drive is the low-noise winner; it also runs cooler than the
UltraStar. But the Fujitsu is slightly faster.</p>

<p>A recent <a
href="http://tech-report.com/reviews/2002q2/ati-nvidia/"> roundup</a>
tells us that the ATI Radeons and NVidia GeForce cards are still top
of the heap.  The Radeon 64MB card (which seems to have been
retroactively named the 8500 64MB) has since been discontinued.  We'll
probably go with the 128MB refresh of the 8500 for the next version.</p>

<p>The new sound card will probably be a
<a href="http://www.turtle-beach.com/site/products/santacruz/indetail.asp">
Turtle Beach Santa Cruz</a>.  The  
<a href="http://www.soundblaster.com/audigy/">Soundblaster Audigy</a>
was a contender too, but the Turtle Beach card has better frequency
response according to the one site that does audio analysis of these
boards.  Besides, the experience with the SB Live! was...mixed.</p>

<p>I'm looking at <a href="http://www.alphanovatech.com/">Alpha
PAL</a> processor heatsinks.  These are designed to be actively 
cooled by a standard 80mm case fan, which can be very quiet.</p>

<p>We'll try <a href="http://www.dynamat.com/">Dynamat</a> insulation
for noise reduction.  Note: we should take dBA measurements before
and after installation.</p>
