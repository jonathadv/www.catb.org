more Unix-nature in one line of shell script than there is in ten thousand
lines of C.</span>”</span></p><p>The programmer, who was very proud of his mastery of C, said:
<span class="quote">“<span class="quote">How can this be?  C is the language in which the very kernel of
Unix is implemented!</span>”</span></p><p>Master Foo replied: <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">That is so. Nevertheless, there is
more Unix-nature in one line of shell script than there is in ten thousand
lines of C.</span>”</span></p><p>The programmer grew distressed.  <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">But through the C
language we experience the enlightenment of the Patriarch Ritchie!  We
become as one with the operating system and the machine, reaping
matchless performance!</span>”</span></p><p>Master Foo replied: <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">All that you say is true. But there
is still more Unix-nature in one line of shell script than there is in ten
thousand lines of C.</span>”</span></p><p>The programmer scoffed at Master Foo and rose to depart.  But
Master Foo nodded to his student Nubi, who wrote a line of shell
script on a nearby whiteboard, and said: <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Master programmer,
consider this pipeline.  Implemented in pure C, would it not span ten
thousand lines?</span>”</span></p><p>The programmer muttered through his beard, contemplating what
Nubi had written.  Finally he agreed that it was so.</p><p><span class="quote">“<span class="quote">And how many hours would you require to implement and
debug that C program?</span>”</span> asked Nubi.</p><p><span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Many,</span>”</span> admitted the visiting programmer.
<span class="quote">“<span class="quote">But only a fool would spend the time to do that when so many
more worthy tasks await him.</span>”</span></p><p><span class="quote">“<span class="quote">And who better understands the Unix-nature?</span>”</span>
Master Foo asked. <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Is it he who writes the ten thousand
lines, or he who, perceiving the emptiness of the task, gains merit by
not coding?</span>”</span></p><p>Upon hearing this, the programmer was enlightened.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="introduction.html"><img src="images/prev.png" alt="Prev" /></a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="script-kiddie.html"><img src="images/next.png" alt="Next" /></a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Editor's Introduction </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html"><img src="images/home.png" alt="Home" /></a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Master Foo and the Script Kiddie</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
