Patriarch McIlroy's mantra ‘Do one thing well’, which
emphasizes that software partakes of the Unix way when it has simple
and consistent behavior, with properties that can be readily modeled by
the mind of the user and used by other programs.</span>”</span></p><p><span class="quote">“<span class="quote">But there is another line of dharma teaching, exemplified by the
Patriarch Thompson's great mantra <span class="quote">‘<span class="quote">When in doubt, use brute
force</span>’</span>, and various sutras on the value of getting 90% of cases
right <span class="emphasis"><em>now</em></span>, rather than 100%
<span class="emphasis"><em>later</em></span>, which emphasizes robustness and simplicity of
implementation.</span>”</span></p><p><span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Now tell me: which programs have the Unix nature?</span>”</span></p><p>After a silence, Nubi observed:</p><p><span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Master, these teachings may conflict.</span>”</span></p><p><span class="quote">“<span class="quote">A simple implementation is likely to lack logic for edge
cases, such as resource exhaustion, or failure to close a race window,
or a timeout during an uncompleted transaction.</span>”</span></p><p><span class="quote">“<span class="quote">When such edge cases occur, the behavior of the software
will become irregular and difficult.  Surely this is not the Way of
Unix?</span>”</span></p><p>Master Foo nodded in agreement.</p><p><span class="quote">“<span class="quote">On the other hand, it is well known that fancy algorithms
are brittle.  Further, each attempt to cover an edge case tends to
interact with both the program's central algorithms and the code
covering other edge cases.</span>”</span></p><p><span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Thus, attempts to cover all edge cases in advance, guaranteeing
‘simplicity of description’, may in fact produce code that is
overcomplicated and brittle or which, plagued by bugs, never ships at all.
Surely this is not the Way of Unix?</span>”</span></p><p>Master Foo nodded in agreement.</p><p><span class="quote">“<span class="quote">What, then, is the proper dharma path?</span>”</span> asked Nubi.</p><p>The master spoke:</p><p><span class="quote">“<span class="quote">When the eagle flies, does it forget that its feet have
touched the ground?  When the tiger lands upon its prey, does it
forget its moment in the air? Three pounds of VAX!</span>”</span></p><p>On hearing this, Nubi was enlightened.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="script-kiddie.html"><img src="images/prev.png" alt="Prev" /></a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="methodology-consultant.html"><img src="images/next.png" alt="Next" /></a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Master Foo and the Script Kiddie </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html"><img src="images/home.png" alt="Home" /></a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Master Foo and the
