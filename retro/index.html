<p>The Retrocomputing Museum is dedicated to programs that induce
sensations that hover somewhere between nostalgia and nausea &mdash; the
freaks, jokes, and fossils of computing history. Our exhibits
include many <a href="#languages">languages</a>, some <a
href="#emulators">machine emulators</a>, and a few <a
href="#games">games</a>.</p>

<p>Most are living history &mdash; environments that were once
important, but are now merely antiques. A few never previously
existed except as thought experiments or pranks. Most, we hope,
convey the hacker spirit &mdash; and if not that, then at least a hint
of what life was like back when programmers were real men and sheep
were nervous.</p>

<p>The curators of the Museum are <a
href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/">Eric S. Raymond</a> and <a
href="mailto:cowan@ccil.org">John Cowan</a>. See Eric's <a
href="charter.html">offer</a> for more about the kinds of
things we build and collect.</p>

<p>If you've visited before, check out the <a href="#newstuff">what's
new</a> section. You, too can contribute to the Museum! If you think
something belongs here, tell us about it. Take a look at our <a
href="#wants">want list</a> of things we're looking for.  Finally, you
can browse a list of <a href="#related">related resources</a>.</p>

<h1><a id="newstuff" name="newstuff">What's New</a></h1>

<p>We now carry an implementation of COMIT, a very early
string-processing language ancestral to SNOBOL, sed, Perl, and other
scripting languages with regular-expression facilities.</p>

<h1><a id="languages" name="languages">Languages</a></h1>

<p>All these packages include documentation and example programs. </p>

<h2><a href="adl.tar.gz">ADL</a></h2>

<p>Adventure Definition Language. Ross Cunniff
&lt;cunniff@fc.hp.com&gt; &amp; Tim Brengle, 1987. An adventure
language, semi-object-oriented with LISP-like syntax. A superset of
the infamous DDL (Dungeon Definition Language). Available for Unix,
MS-DOS, Amiga and Acorn. You can find other adventure-writing
languages at the <a
href="http://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXprogramming.html">
Interactive Fiction Archive</a>.</p>

<h2><a href="a60-0.20a.tar.gz">algol-60</a></h2>

<p>An interpreter for Algol-60, the common ancestor of C, Pascal,
Algol-68, Modula, Ada, and most other conventional languages that
aren't BASIC, FORTRAN, or COBOL. Correctly described by Edsger
Dijkstra (one of its co-designers) as "a great improvement on many of
its successors". This distribution (which seems to originate <a
href='ftp://ftp.tu-bs.de/local/algol60/'>here</a>) includes TeX
source for the Algol 60 Report.  There is a <a
href='http://www.gnu.org/software/marst/marst.html'>GNU
implementation</a> as well.  More resources, including sample
programs, are available <a
href='http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~lloyd/tildeProgLang/Algol60/'>here</a>.</p>

<h2><a href='http://www.algol68.org/'>Algol 68</a></h2>

<p>(Off-site link) This page collects resources &mdash;
implementations, documentation, etc &mdash; related to Algol 68, the
most magnificent combination of theoretical success and practical
failure in the history of programming languages. More Algol68
resources can be found at the <a
href="http://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/ALGOL/algol68impl">Software
Preservation Group</a>.</p>

<h2><a href="advsys.tar.gz">ADVSYS</a></h2>

<p>ADVenture SYStem, another adventure-writing system by David Betz,
1986. The language describes it as "LISP-like and object-oriented".
We carry it mainly for comparison with ADL. You can find other
adventure-writing languages at <a
href="ftp://ftp.gmd.de/if-archives/programming"></a>ftp://ftp.gmd.de/if-archives/programming.</p>

<h2><a href="apl11.tar.gz">apl-11</a></h2>

<p>A very old and very weird APL implementation. Said to contain
substantial amounts of code written by Ken Thompson, one of UNIX's
coinventors.</p>

<h2><a href="http://microautocode.sourceforge.net/">Autocoder</a></h2>

<p>Before FORTRAN (the first compiled langage) was Autocode (the first
interpreter), dating from 1954.  Amazingly, it has been revived as a
control language for microcontrollers!</p>

<h2><a href="bloop.shar.gz">bloop</a></h2>

<p>The BlooP and FlooP languages from Chapter XIII of Goedel, Escher,
Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid by Douglas R. Hofstadter. BlooP
mechanizes primitive-recursive functions, FlooP mechanizes
general-recursive ones. Thoroughly primitive otherwise. Implemented
as a Perl interpreter which generates Perl and promptly interprets
it (how Hofstadterian!), by John Cowan
&lt;cowan@locke.ccil.org&gt;.</p>

<h2><a href="bwbasic-2.10.tar.gz">BASIC</a></h2>

<p>BASIC lives &mdash; unfortunately. This version implements most of the
notoriously bad ANSI X3.113-1987 standard for Full Basic. As the
Computer Contradictionary succinctly observes, "Shit with icing". </p>

<h2><a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/mr/BCPL.html">BCPL</a></h2>

<p>(Offsite link.) The design of C was based on an earlier language,
B, which was an interpretive typeless subset of BCPL.  This
implementation includes a suite of demonstration programs.  We also
carry a <a href="btoc.tar.gz">B-to-C translator</a>.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.josvisser.nl/opencomal/">COMAL</a></h2>

<p>(Offsite link) This is (more or less) what happened when a Danish
schoolteacher got fed up with Basic back in the early 1980s.  COMAL
added procedures and various structured-programming facilities.  It
was popular in the Commodore-64 community in Europe for a few years.
This vesrsion has been heavily extended, but still conveys some of
the flavor of what those 1980s micro languages were like.  There is
a very interesting <a
href='http://www.macharsoft.co.uk/forum/bibliog.html'>history</a> of
the language (presented as introduction to a bibliography) which puts
it in context with BASIC.</p>

<h2><a href="cfoogol.shar.gz">cfoogol</a></h2>

<p>A compiler for a very, very tiny subset of Algol (no procedures,
even). More a demonstration on how to write a recursive descent
parser than anything else. Generates stupid but portable C code.</p>

<h2><a href="http://tiny-cobol.sourceforge.net/">COBOL</a></h2>

<p>COBOL is still a living language in 2004, but we've included a link
to an open-source implementation because it's nearly as crufty as
some of the horrible old dead ones we keep here.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/comit">COMIT</a></h2>

<p>COMIT, dating from 1957, was the first programming language
designed specifically for string manipulation.  It was directly
ancestral to SNOBOL, and through SNOBOL to sed(1), perl(1) and all
other languages built around regular expressions. This is an
interpreter for the COMIT II language as described in "Programming
with COMIT II" by Victor H. Yngwe, MIT Press 1972.  Excerpts from that
book, along with Yngve's 1958 paper on COMIT, are included with the
distribution.</p>

<p>Not all features of the language are interpreted, but enough of
them are to run real programs - or, at least, what passed for real
programs when COMIT II was a live research tool.  Example programs are
included and used as correctness tests for the interpreter.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/cupl">cupl</a></h2>

<p>Another hideous old design, CUPL &mdash; Cornell University Programming
Language. It looks something like a really archaic BASIC with
linear-algebra builtins. This 1.1 version now also interprets and
documents CUPL's immediate precdecessor, CORC (Cornell Computing
Language). I (esr) reverse-engineered it from the original manuals,
written in 1966 and 1962; the language-description parts of the
manuals are included in the docs. If you want to know what
programming was like before interactive time-sharing, build this
and find out. Requires either lex or flex, and bison or yacc.<p>

<p>Note: there's a <a href="http://www.logicaldevices.com">modern
CUPL</a>, an EDA tool, that is unrelated to this language.</p>

<h2><a href="focal.tar.gz">focal</a></h2>

<p>A very archaic educational language, a sibling of (and closely
resembling) MUMPS.</p>

<h2><a
href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/intercal/">INTERCAL</a></h2>

<p>A computer language designed by Don Woods and James Lyons in 1972.
INTERCAL is purposely different from all other computer languages
in all ways but one; it is purely a written language, being totally
unspeakable. Said by the authors to stand for "Computer Language
With No Pronounceable Acronym". INTERCAL devotees hang out on the
<a href="news:alt.lang.intercal">alt.lang.intercal</a> newsgroup.</p>

<h2><a href="jcl_shell.tar.gz">jcl_shell</a></h2>

<p>The JCL Shell is a Unix shell which emulates, in style and syntax,
the infamously complex and perverse Job Control Language used to
control IBM mainframes.</p>

<h2><a href="joss.tar.gz">JOSS</a></h2>

<p>Joss, the JOHNNIAC Open Shop System, was an early interactive
calculator language similar in scope to Unix's bc(1) calculator,
but with a rather more English-like syntax. We have a rudimentary
implementation and two sample programs. We'd be very grateful to
anyone who could supply documentation.</p>

<h2><a href="kvik.tar.gz">kvikkalkul</a></h2>

<p>A very odd little language alleged to have been used for
embedded-systems control on Swedish nuclear submarines in the
1950s. Notable for its probabilistic-jump instruction.</p>

<h2><a href="ftp://anarres.cs.berkeley.edu/pub/ucblogo/">logo</a></h2>

<p>The language that gave us "turtle graphics" &mdash; intended (in the
approximate words of one coauthor) for 5-year-old children and less
educable beings, such as corporate executives. Rather advanced for
1968; it was really a sort of stealth LISP with pretty displays.</p>

<p>(Note: we don't carry this locally &mdash; we don't know the state of
its documentation, or whether it includes examples.)</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/mad">MAD</a></h2>

<p>We have an implementation of MAD, the Michigan Algorithmic Decoder 
from 1959-1962.  The entire original manual, including diagrams and
flowcharts, is included in the distribution.  So is a chrestomathy 
of programs.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/mdk/">mdk</a></h2>

<p>An implementation of the MIX pseudoassembler used for algorithm
description in Donald E. Knuth's <cite>The Art Of Computer
Programming</cite>, vol I. This is the GNU implementation,
which replaces the MIXAL package I formerly maintained. It includes
all the material Donald Knuth contributed to MIXAL.</p>

<h2><a href="orthogonal.shar.gz">orthogonal</a></h2>

<p>Finally, a truly orthogonal language! This unique design, inspired
by a speculative thread on alt.lang.intercal in September 1994, is
an interpreter for a simple language with two-dimensional control
structures...your control flow can go forwards, backwards, or
sideways (or even diagonally!).</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/pilot">pilot</a></h2>

<p>The reference implementation for IEEE standard PILOT, a horrible
language designed in 1962 on IBM mainframes that a group of ancient
academics was still insane enough to be using in 1990 &mdash;- and not
only using but <em>standardizing</em>. I (esr) wrote this
implementation as a weekend hack.</p>

<h2><a href="plankalkuel">plankalk&uuml;l</a></h2>

<p>HTMLized version of the CACM paper describing Zuse's Plankalk&uuml;l
design. Note: the diagrams and some of the glyphs in this paper are
GIF images. Here's an <a
href="http://www.zib.de/zuse/Inhalt/Programme/Plankalkuel/index.html">
implementation</a> and more <a
href="http://www.zib.de/zuse/index.html">documentation</a>.</p>

<h2><a href="plmtoc.tar.gz">PL/M</a></h2>

<p>Once upon a time in the early 1960s, there was a monster called
PL/1 that was IBM's attempt to create The Final Language. Ten years
later Gary Kildall wrote a compiler for a tiny subset he called
PL/M as a development tool for 8080 micros (and wrote CP/M as a
demonstration project for the language). This program is a
PL/M-to-C translator by Robert Ankeney. </p>

<h2><a href="small.v3.tar.gz">Smalltalk</a></h2>

<p>Starting in 1972, Adele Goldberg and other researchers at XEROX
PARC began experiments with personal interactive computing that
were to tremendously influence many later environments, especially
including the Macintosh. The language they designed for development
in their icons-windows-and-mice environment was Smalltalk. We offer
an implementation here.</p>

<h2><a
href="http://www.snobol4.org">snobol4</a></h2>

<p>One of the most interesting, original, and influential languages of
the 1960s, SNOBOL was designed around string-processing,
pattern-matching, and textual transformation. Like many other
one-idea languages (TRAC, APL) it was extremely powerful and
elegant within its problem domain, but weak outside it (there also
seems to be a law that such languages must have obscure syntax). It
strongly influenced UNIX regular expression notation. Docs and
example programs are bundled with the so-called `vanilla'
distribution. (Note: we don't keep this locally.) (You may also
want to check out the <a
href="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/www/index.html">Icon home
page.</a>)</p>

<h2><a href="mflteco.tar.gz">teco</a></h2>

<p>Yes, it's the Editor From Hell...the infamous TECO, bane of lusers
and tricky, unforgiving tool of master hackers. Build this to find out
(a) what we lived with before Emacs, and (b) how expressive line noise
can be. This is Sander Van Malsen's ANSIfied version of TECO for
Ultrix. For other versions of TECO, see the collection at <a
href='http://sunsite.tus.ac.jp/pub/academic/computer-science/history/pdp-11/teco/'>http://sunsite.tus.ac.jp/pub/academic/computer-science/history/pdp-11/teco/</a>.</p>

<h2><a href="trac.shar.gz">trac</a></h2>

<p>An extremely funky computer language based entirely on macro
processing. There is an interpreter written in Perl, and a text
file documenting the language and the implementation. This
implementation is by John Cowan &lt;cowan@locke.ccil.org&gt;.</p>

<h2><a href="turingolCompiler.tar.gz">Turingol in Java</a></h2>

<p>Turingol, a language for programming Turing machines. Invented by
Donald Knuth to demonstrate some technical points in compiler
design (featured the first construction of a nontrivial attribute
grammar). See "Semantics of Context-Free Languages", D. Knuth, Math
Sys Thy 2:127-145 (1975). This implementation is written in Java by
Georges Focant.</p>

<h2><a href="turingol-1.0.0.tar.gz">Turingol in C</a></h2>

<p>An implementation of Turingol in C by <a
href="http://gungnir.csbnet.se/~peteg/">Peter Gammie</a>. Dumps
the tape states during computation to standard output. This version
has been lightly adapted from Gammie's original for the Museum.</p>

<h2><a
href="http://www.geocities.com/connorbd/varaq/">var'aq</a></h2>

<p>A stack-based, Forth-like language for speakers of Klingon. The
author says: "var'aq is the bastard child of a back-room tryst
between PostScript and Lisp after a Star Trek convention....it's
really something of a Klingon Basic, a simple, loosely-typed
programming language designed mostly just to be used for
programming things like command displays and high-level control
systems. In its eventual final incarnation, we're looking at
concurrency, advanced mathematics, and even native support for
distributed programs..."</p>

<h2><a href="http://wenyan-lang.lingdong.works/">wenyan-lang</a></h2>

<p>Retro in a different direction: this programming language uses the
orthography <em>and</em> mimics the syntax and gammar of Classical
Chinese.</p>

<h2><a
href="http://www.eleves.ens.fr:8080/home/madore/programs/unlambda/">Unlambda</a></h2>

<p>The author describes Unlambda as "Your Functional Programming
Language Nightmares Come True". Elsewhere, there is a <a
href="http://home.nvg.org/~oerjan/unl-int/">Unlambda interpreter in
INTERCAL</a>.</p>

<h1><a id="emulators" name="emulators">Emulators</a></h1>

<h2><a href="oisc.shar.gz">oisc</a></h2>

<p>You've heard of RISC, Reduced Instruction Set Computers? Well, here
is the concept taken to its logical extreme &mdash; an emulator for a
computer with just one (1) instruction (Subtract and Branch if
Negative)! Sample programs in the OISC machine language are
included.</p>

<p>We now have available have a revised and expanded version of
oisc called <a href="oic.tgz">OIC</a>. In the future, this may
replace OISC.</p>

<h2><a href="urisc.tar.gz">urisc</a></h2>

<p>There have been several demonstration emulators for machine
architectures with single instructions. This is another. Examples
of its unique assembly language are included.</p>

<h2><a href="http://wenyan-lang.lingdong.works/">wenyan-lang</a></h2>

<p>Retro in a different direction: this programming language uses the
orthography <em>and</em> mimics the syntax and gammar of Classical
Chinese.</p>

<h2><a
href="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/academic/computer-science/history/pdp-8">
PDP/8</a></h2>

<p>The DEC PDP/8 was the best-selling computer in the world until the
advent of the Apple II. However, we don't maintain PDP-8 software
here, because there is an excellent archive at sunsite.unc.edu in the
`/pub/academic/computer-science/history/pdp8' directory; various
emulators are available in the `emulators' subdirectory. On a modern
RISC box, an emulator can run faster than the ancient TTL hardware it
is emulating!</p>

<h1><a id="games" name="games">Games</a></h1>

<h2><a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/wumpus/">wumpus</a></h2>

<p>A faithful clone of the classic Hunt The Wumpus game, exactly as it
appeared in 1972 on the Dartmouth Time-Sharing System. Also
includes an original but strangely similar game, superhack.</p>

<p>(This game has popped up in some odd places. You can actually
play it on a <a href="http://www.yospace.com">WAP cellphone</a>).</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/open-adventure/">Open Adventure</a></h2>

<p>Colossal Cave Adventure - not the 350-point 1977 version in the BSD
Games collection, but the 430-point 1995 version that was the last one
Crowther & Woods worked on. Issued with the permission of the
authors.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/super-star-trek/">Super Star Trek</a></h2>

<p>SST2K is a modern Unix port of the University of Texas "Star Trek"
game originally written in FORTRAN in the mid-1970s. It has options to
restrict its feature set to what was in earlier versions.</p>

<h1>Possible Future Projects</h1>

<h2><a href="ignorance.shar.gz">ignorance (?)</a></h2>

<p>The Museum has an incomplete BLISS-to-C compiler. A
substantial amount of BLISS source code is available for use as
test code.</p>

<h1><a id="wants" name="wants">Things We Are Especially Looking
For</a></h1>

<p>Implementations, or softcopy specifications, for the following
languages:</p>

<p>IPL-V, SLIP, RPG, JOVIAL, CORAL, POP-2 or POP-10, 1401 Autocoder, NEAT/3.</p>

<p>Hm, there seens to be a Coral spec <a
href='http://www.xgc.com/manuals/xgc-c66-rm/book1.html'>here</a>....</p>

<p>Sample programs to add to the distributions for the following
languages:</p>

<p>FOCAL, ALGOL-60, JCL, TECO.</p>

<h1><a name="related">Related Resources</a></h1>

<h2>The Heirloom Project</h2>

<para>The <a
href="http://heirloom.sourceforge.net/index.html">Heirloom Project</a>
provides a large collection of classic Unix tools forward-ported from
OpenSolaris.  The curator says: "Some people like to drive classic
cars, others like to arrange their domiciles with period
furniture. The Heirloom Project caters to people who like to operate
their computers using a traditional Unix command line interface. The
Heirloom Project is not a software museum; it does not attempt to
preserve utilities unmodified. Rather, it keeps stylistic,
algorithmic, and interface aspects intact while modernizing the
framework as appropriate."</para>

<h2>The Source of Multics</h2>

<p>(Off-site link) The source code of the <a
href="http://web.mit.edu/multics-history/">Multics</a> operating
system has been opened and is now available from MIT. This was one of
the pioneering timesharing operating systems of the mid-1960s --
actually, only the second one ever built, after CTSS -- and was
the design ancestor of Unix.</p>

<h2><a href="ftp://ftp.cc.utexas.edu/pub/AI_ATTIC">The AI Attic</a></h2>

<p>This is an archive of classic AI programs and games including Eliza,
Adventure, and many others. Also, implementations of AI languages
including XLISP and many others. The Attic is an FTP archive
located at: {bongo,ftp}.cc.utexas.edu:pub/AI_ATTIC.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/">The Jargon File</a></h2>

<p>This is a collection of Internet slang, folklore, and history. The entry
page also offers you the option to download it in one of several
formats.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/software.html">Eric's Software</a></h2>

<p>The collection of open-source software that I wrote and/or
maintain. There is some overlap with this collection, of course.</p>

<h2><a href="http://99-bottles-of-beer.ls-la.net/">The Beer List</a></h2>

<p>This is a collection of implementations of a trivial program (one
to print out the lyrics of "99 Bottles Of Beer On The Wall") in
lots of different languages. A very interesting chrestomathy.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.ee.upenn.edu/~jan/eniacproj.html">Eniac On A Chip</a></h2>

<p>Perhaps the ultimate retrocomputing-in-hardware project! Don't miss
the nifty picture of the test chip.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/contents.html">The Analytical Engine</a></h2>

<p>And this must be the ultimate retrocomputing-in-software project;
an emulator of Babbage's Analytical Engine, with lots of supporting
documentation.</p>

<h2><a
href="http://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/Station/2266/tarpit/tarpit.html">The Turing Tarpit</a></h2>

<p>Yet another page of nasty old languages.</p>

<h2><a
href="http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/bletchleypark/index.htm">Bletchley
Park</a></h2>

<p>Perhaps the most remarkable hardware retrocomputing hack yet was
Tony Sale's painstaking reconstruction of the Colossus machine, a
parallel computer built for codebreaking during WWII and kept
secret for fifty years afterwards.</p>

<h2><a href="http://simh.trailing-edge.com/">The Computer History
Simulation Project</a></h2>

<p>A collection of simulations of historical machines.</p>


<h2><a href="https://livingcomputers.org/">Living Computers Museum</a></h2>

<p>Another collection that you can reach by running
"menu@tty.livingcomputers.org" at a Linux shell prompt.  It will give
you a menu of emulations of some very old systems you can play with,
including for example Unix version 7 and TOPS-10.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.homebrewcpu.com/">Magic-1</a></h2>

<p>Bill Buzbee designed and home-built computer roughly equivalent in
power to an eary 8086 using TTL chips and wire-wrap. Then he
hand-built an OS for it, retargeted a C compiler to it, and ported
Minix to it. Need we add that it has a front panel full of switches
and blinkenlights?</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.hpfriedrichs.com/pr-punch.htm">Spiked Punch</a></h2>

<p>A ne plus ultra of old-school hacking back in the 1980s from a
high-school kid who homebrew-hacked an IBM card punch to be driven by
a TRS-80...and, decades later, recovered the original hardware and
describes how he did it. With photographs.</p>
