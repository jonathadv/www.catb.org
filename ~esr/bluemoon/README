				Blue Moon
			by Tim Lister and Eric S. Raymond

This simple game includes complete instructions on the game screen.  It needs
to be linked with an SVr4-compatible curses.  For best results, use the
ncurses library distributed with Linux.

README		-- this file
Makefile	-- how to build it
bluemoon.c	-- the code
bluemoon.xml	-- DocBook RefEntry source of the manual page
bluemoon.6	-- man page derived from XML.

Changes since the initial release have been in the packaging.  Please don't
hack bluemoon.6, enhance the XML masters instead.
