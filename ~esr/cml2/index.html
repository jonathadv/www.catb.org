<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>The CML2 Resources Page</H1>

<p>CML2 is a configuration system, centered around a domain-specific
minilanguage, that I originally wrote to replace the code that currently
handles build-option selection for Linux kernels (that is, when you
type `make config', `make menuconfig' or `make xconfig').  However,
it is designed to be more generally useful for addressing complex
configuration problems.

<p>My 1.0.0 release announcement to the linux-kernel list is <a
href="ANNOUNCEMENT">here</a>.  You can also look at <a
href="NEWS">project news</a>.

<p>To understand the design, you should read the white paper <a
href="cml2-paper.html">The CML2 Language</a> and (depending on how far
you want to get into the language) also <a
href="cml2-reference.html">The CML2 Reference Manual</a>.

<P>Scott Bronson has supplied a <a href="smallexample.cml">small example</a>
to help get you started on composing your own rulesets.

<p>You can download a copy of the <a href="cml2-2.3.0.tar.gz">CML2
sources</a> and documentation. Note: you will need Python 2.0 to
run this software.

<H1>CML2 and the Linux kernel</H1>

Resources for helping Linux configuration maintainers make
the transition from CML1 to CML2 are collected here.

<p>The distribution includes a <a href="transition.html">transition
guide</a> intended to help maintainers of existing Linux configuration code
move to the new system.

<H1>Projects using CML2</H1>

<p>CML2 is scheduled to be integrated into the Linux kernel source
tree between 2.5.1 and 2.5.2.

<p>CML2 is already being used in another public development effort;
the <a href="http://www.emdebian.org">Embedded Debian Project</a>.

<p>CML2 is also being used at <a href="http://www.webmachines.com/">
Webmachines</a> to build the embedded Linux that they blow into flash
memory on their hardware.  Here's an adaptation of the 
<a href="webmachines.cml">rulefile</a> they use, with an explanatory
header comment.

<p>CML2 is being used to write a suite called `compache'
that downloads, configures, and builds Apache.

compiler</a>
