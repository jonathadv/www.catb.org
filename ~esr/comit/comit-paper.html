<div class="paragraph">
<p>IT HAS BEEN SAID that the automatic digital computer can do anything
with symbols that we can tell it in detail how to do. If we are
interested in telling a digital computer to translate texts from one
language into another language, we are faced with two tasks. We first
have to find out in detail how to translate a text from one language
to another. Then we have to "tell" the computer how to do it. This
paper is concerned with the second task. We will present here a
specially devised language in which the linguist can conveniently
"tell" the computer to do things that he wants it to do.  The
automatic digital computer has been designed to handle mathematical
problems. It is able to carry out complicated routines in terms of a
few different kinds of elementary operations such as adding two
numbers, subtracting a number from another number, moving a number
from one location to another, taking its next instruction from one of
two places depending on whether a given number is negative or
positive, and so on. In order to instruct the computer to carry out
complicated routines, simple instructions for the elementary
operations are combined into a program. The writing of a program to
carry out even an apparently rather simple procedure can be an
exacting task requiring a high degree of skill on the part of the
programmer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It has been the custom for the linguist who wanted to try out a
certain approach to mechanical translation to ask an expert programmer
to program his material rather than to learn the art of programming
himself. Besides the usual inconveniences and difficulties attending
the communication between experts in two separate fields, this
practice has certain more basic difficulties: Neither the linguist nor
the programmer has been able to be fully effective.  The linguist has
not become aware of the full power of the machine, and the programmer,
not being a linguist, has not been able to use his special knowledge
of the machine with full effectiveness on linguistic problems.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The solution offered here to these difficulties is an automatic
programming system. The linguist writes the results of his research in
a notation or language called COMIT, which has been specially devised
to fill his needs. The programmer writes a conversion program or
compiler capable of converting anything written in this notation into
a program that can be run on the computer. footnote[This is being done
by the programming research staff of the M.I. T. Computation Center.]
Thus the expense, time, and effort needed to separately program each
linguistic approach is saved, and, even more important, the linguist
is given direct access to the machine. He becomes more fully aware of
its potentialities, and his research is greatly facilitated.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_what_comit_is">What COMIT Is</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>COMIT is an automatic programming system for an electronic digital
computer that provides the linguist with a simple language in which he
can express the results of his researches and in which he can direct
the computer to analyze, synthesize, or translate sentences. It is
capable of being programmed on any general purpose computer having
enough storage and appropriate input and output equipment. The
language has been devised to meet the needs of the linguist who wants
to work in the fields of syntax and mechanical translation. Some of
the linguistic devices and operations that COMIT has been designed to
express are: immediate constituent structure, discontinuous
constituents, coordination, subordination, transformations and
rearrangements, change in the number of sentences or clauses in
translation, agreement, government, selectional restrictions,
recursive rules, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A program written in COMIT consists of a number of rules written in a
special notation.  The computer executes these rules one at a time in
a predetermined order. In seeking an appropriate notation in which to
write the rules, we were guided by several considerations.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>That the rules be convenient for the linguist - compact, easy to
use, and easy to think in terms of.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That the rules be flexible and powerful — that they not only
reflect the current linguistic views on what grammar rules are, but
also that they be easily adaptable to other linguistic views,</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A linguist can use the computer in the following simple way. He
expresses the results of his linguistic research in COMIT. He
transcribes his rules onto punched cards using a device with a
typewriter keyboard. He supplies text or special instructions to the
machine also on punched cards. He then gives these packs of cards to
an operator and subsequently receives his results in the form of
printed sheets from the machine.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The way that a COMIT program works in the computer is shown in figure
1. The rules making up the COMIT program can be thought of as stored
in the computer at A. Material to be translated or otherwise operated
on enters the computer under the control of the rules from the input
B. It is operated on by the rules and translated in the workspace
C. It then goes to the output E. The dispatcher D contains special
information, stored there by the rules, which governs the flow of
control or the order in which the rules of the program are carried
out.</p>

<p>The way in which COMIT rules are written, how they direct the computer

programs will now be described. The remainder of the paper is thus a

special-purpose programming language.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A rule in COMIT has five sections, the name, the left half, the right
half, the routing, and the go-to, each with its special
functions. Figure 2 shows how a rule is divided into these</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>five sections. The name and left half are separated by a space, the
left half and the right half are separated by an equal sign, the right
half and the routing are separated by two fraction bars, and the
routing and the go-to are separated by a space;</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_flow_of_control">flow of control</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We will discuss first the function of the name and the go-to, which
have to do with the flow of control from one rule to another. A
program written in COMIT always starts with the first rule in
sequence. After a rule has been carried out, the computer obtains in
the go-to the name of the next rule to be carried out. The name of
each rule is to be found in the lefthand part of the name section of
that rule. (The right-hand part of the name section is reserved for
the subrule name, to be discussed later.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition there are three cases when control is automatically
transferred to the next rule in sequence regardless of its name. One
of these will be immediately clear; the other two will be clarified in
the explanations of the left half and the routing. The three are: (1)
an asterisk is written in the go-to, (2) the constituents written in
the left half of the rule were not found in the workspace, (3) an *R
in the routing finds no more material at the input. A rule to which
control is always transferred automatically in this fashion so that a
rule name is not needed, may have an asterisk in the name section in
place of a rule name. When this automatic transfer of control takes
place from the last rule in sequence so that there is no next rule,
the COMIT program stops.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Figure 3 shows an example of how control proceeds from one rule to
another under the direction of the rule name and the go-to
sections. In this program, rule A would be the first one executed,
then C, then the rule with an asterisk in the name section, then B,
then C, then *, then back to B again, and so on round and round in
what is known as a loop, until one of the conditions occurs in the
rule marked asterisk that will automatically transfer control to the
next rule D. After D has been executed, the program will stop.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As an aid to the memory, we will give a way in which each part of a
rule in COMIT can be read in English. This will be done by providing
English equivalents for all abbreviations used in COMIT, and by
providing certain conventional wordings that will always be used
between the various sections and between the various
abbreviations. For the parts of the rule already discussed we need the
following conventions: A rule is preceded by the word "in", rule names
are preceded by the words "the rule", the go-to is preceded by the
words "then go to", an * in the name section is read "this rule", an *
in the go-to is read "the next rule, " and the rule is followed by a
period to make a sentence.  These conventions are enough to read the
program in figure 3. These and the other conventions are conveniently
tabulated in a later section. According to the conventions, the
program in figure 3 should be read:</p>
</div>
<div class="verseblock">
<pre class="content">In/the rule A/&#8230;&#8203; /then go to/the rule C/.
In/the rule B/&#8230;&#8203; /then go to/the next rule/.
In/the rule C/&#8230;&#8203; /then go to/the next rule/.
In/this rule /&#8230;&#8203; /then go to/the rule B/.
In/the rule D/&#8230;&#8203; /then go to/the next rule/.</pre>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The dispatcher also can influence the flow of
control in the following way: A rule in COMIT
may have several subrules. In figure 4, the
rule B has four subrules. The rule name is</p>

<p>in the left hand part of the name section of the first subrule. The
name of each subrule is in the right hand part of the name section of
that subrule. A rule that does not have several subrules may be
thought of as a rule with just one subrule. A rule with only one
subrule does not have a subrule name. When control is transferred to a
rule with several subrules, the dispatcher is consulted for an
indication of which subrule is to be carried out. For this purpose the
dispatcher contains dispatcher entries. A dispatcher entry of the form
B E would cause the computer to execute the subrule E in rule B each
time it comes to that rule. If there is no entry in the dispatcher for
this particular rule, or if there is an entry, but it contains more
than one subrule name, the choice is made at random. In other words,
if the dispatcher contains the entry B E G, the computer will choose
at random between the two alternative subrules E and G. A dispatcher
entry having a minus sign in front of its values (subrule names) has
the same meaning as it would have if it had all its possible values
except those following the minus sign. A dispatcher entry with a rule
name but no values has the same meaning as one with all possible
values, that is, choose completely at random. The contents of the
dispatcher are not altered by any of these processes. How the contents
of the dispatcher may be altered will be discussed in the section on
the routing.</p>

<h3 id="_workspace">Workspace</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Having discussed the flow of control, we will
turn to the 'workspace' and describe how text to
be translated or other material to be worked on
is represented there. This will prepare us for
a discussion of the remaining three parts of
the rule whose function it is to operate on the
material in the workspace.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Material is stored in the workspace as a series of 'constituents'
separated by plus signs.  A constituent consists either of a symbol
alone or a symbol and one or more subscripts. The symbol is written
first. It may be the textual material itself, a word, phrase, or part
of a word; or it may be any temporary word or abbreviation that the
linguist finds convenient to use. Subscripts are of two kinds, logical
subscripts and numerical subscripts. Logical subscripts are potential
dispatcher entries and thus have the form of a rule name (subscript
name) followed by one or more subrule names (values).  Numerical
subscripts are used for numbering and counting purposes. They consist
of a period for the subscript name followed by an integer n in the
range 0 ≤ n &lt; 2^15 . A constituent may have any number of logical
subscripts, but only one numerical subscript.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An example of how linguistic material can be represented in the
workspace is given in figure 5. This could be read in English as
follows: "a constituent consisting of/the symbol IN/ with/the
numerical subscript/1/ , followed by/ a constituent consisting of/the
symbol DER/ with/the numerical subscript/2/ , followed by/ a
constituent consisting of/the symbol ADJ/with/ the numerical
subscript/3/ , and with/the sub- script AFF/having/the value EN/ ,
followed by/a constituent consisting of/the symbol NOUN/ with/the
numerical subscript/4/ , and with/the subscript GENDER/having/the
value FEM/."  The conventional wordings and the readings for the
abbreviations used may be found tabulated near the end of this
article.</p>

<h3 id="_left_half">Left half</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Having discussed the name and go-to sections and shown how material is
represented in the workspace, we are now ready to discuss the
remaining three sections of a rule. First we will take up the left
half. A rule with several subrules may have no more than one left
half. It is written in the first subrule. The function of the 'left
half' is to indicate to the computer which constituents in the
workspace are to be operated on by the rest of the rule. The
constituents in the workspace to be operated on are indicated by
writing constituents in the left half that match them in certain
definite respects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A 'match condition' between a constituent in the workspace and a
constituent written in the left half will be recognized if the
following conditions hold: (1) The symbols are identical. (2) If the
constituent in the left half has any subscripts written on it, the
constituent in the workspace must also have at least subscripts with
the indicated subscript names — the order of writing the subscripts
has no significance. (3) If the logical subscripts in the left half
have any values indicated, the subscripts in the workspace must also
have at least these values — again the order is unimportant. (4) If a
numerical subscript is written in the left half, the numerical
subscript in the workspace must have an identical numerical value, but
if . G or . L is written in the left half before the value of a
numerical subscript, a numerical subscript in the workspace will be
matched if it has, respectively, a value greater than or less than the
value written in the left half.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>'Dollar signs' written in the left half have special meanings. $1 may
be written in the left half to match any arbitrary symbol. If the $1
is followed by subscripts, they are matched in the normal fashion. A
dollar sign followed by any number greater than 1 ($4) will match the
indicated number of constituents. It cannot have subscripts. A dollar
sign without a number can be written as a constituent in the left half
and can match any number of constituents in the workspace, including
none. This is called an indefinite dollar sign, while those with
numbers are called definite dollar signs.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>a) Each constituent matches:
B + D/L,M, N + D/P Q + E/.3 + F/.5  + G/R
B + C/L,N    + D/Q   + E/.3 + F/.G2 + $1

b) None of the constituents match:
B + D/L,M    + D/P   + E/.3 + F/.5  + G/S
A + C/L,M,N  + D/P Q + E/.2 + F/.L5 + $1/R</pre>

<p>Fig. 6. Examples of match and no-match conditions. The top lines in a)
and b) represent constituents in the workspace.  The bottom lines
represent constituents as written in the left half.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As an example of how constituents written in the left half can match
constituents found in the workspace, figure 6 a shows several of the
possibilities. Each constituent in the second line represents a
constituent as it might be written in the left half. It matches the
workspace constituent written directly above it in the first line.  In
figure 6 b, none of the constituents meet the match conditions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The computer carries out a 'search' for a match condition between each
of the constituents written in the left half and corresponding
constituents in the workspace in the following way: The first
constituent on the left in the left half is compared in turn with each
constituent in the workspace starting from the left until a match is
found. The computer then attempts to match the next constituent in the
left half with the next constituent in the workspace and so on until
either all constituents written in the left half have been matched, or
one constituent fails to match. In this case, the computer starts
again with the first constituent in the left half and searches for
another match in the workspace.  Finally, either a match is found for
all of the constituents and the computer goes on to execute the rest
of the rule, or the computer cannot find the indicated structure in
the workspace, in which case control is automatically transferred to
the next rule. It can be seen that a structure will be found in the
workspace only if it has matching constituents that are consecutive
and in the same order as those written in the left half.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If an indefinite dollar sign is the first constituent in the left
half, it will match all of the constituents in the workspace to the
left of any constituent that is matched by the second constituent in
the left half. If the indefinite dollar sign is the last constituent
in the left half, it will match all of the constituents in the
workspace to the right of any constituent that is matched by the next
to the last constituent in the left half.  If there are two or more
indefinite dollar signs written in the same left half, they must be
separated by constituents that are not dollar signs, or by $1 with
subscripts, in order to prevent an ambiguity as to which constituents
in the workspace are to be found by the several indefinite dollar
signs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If an indefinite dollar sign has constituents written on each side of
it in the left half, the computer will first try to match all
constituents to the left of the indefinite dollar sign. It does not
have to search again for the constituents to the left of the dollar
sign unless a number (as will be explained shortly) referring to a
constituent to the left of the indefinite dollar sign is written to
the right of the indefinite dollar sign.  In this case, the computer
will search for a new match for constituents to the left of the
indefinite dollar sign if it fails to find a match with the
constituents to the right of the indefinite dollar sign.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Constituents in the left half are conceived of as being 'numbered'
starting with one on the left.  The leftmost constituent is called the
number one constituent in the left half. When the constituents written
in the left half have been successfully matched with constituents in
the workspace, the constituents in the workspace that have been found
are temporarily numbered by the computer in the same way as the
constituents in the left half. The constituent in the workspace found
by the number one constituent in the left half thus becomes the number
one constituent in the workspace. The temporary numbering of
constituents in the workspace remains until it is altered by the right
half or until the rule has been completely executed. Its purpose is to
allow expressions in the left half, right half and routing to refer to
constituents in the workspace by their temporary number.  The various
steps in a search are indicated in the example given in figure 7. The
lower two lines give the constituents as they are written in the left
half of a rule, and the way in which the computer numbers these
constituents.</p>

order to find in the workspace (top line) the structure written in the
left half of the rule (next to bottom line).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The top line indicates the current contents of the workspace. Lines a)
through e) represent the way in which the computer temporarily numbers
the constituents in the workspace that have been successfully matched
at each step of the search.  The first step is indicated in line a):
an attempted match between the number one constituent in the left half
and the first constituent on the left in the workspace fails. In line
b), the number one constituent matches the second constituent in the
workspace, but an attempted match between the number two constituent
in the left half and the third constituent in the workspace fails. In
line c), the number one constituent in the left half matches the third
constituent in the workspace, and the number two the fourth, but since
the number three constituent is an indefinite dollar sign and can
match any number of constituents including none, the next constituent,
number four is matched with the fifth in the workspace. The match
fails. Having already matched the constituents in the left half to the
left of the indefinite dollar sign, the computer now tries to match
the constituents to the right of the indefinite dollar sign. In line
d), it finds a match of the number four constituent with the sixth,
but the number five constituent in the left half fails to match the
seventh constituent in the workspace. The computer then tries again
with the number four constituent, and in e) finds a match between the
number four and number five constituents in the left half and the
seventh and eighth constituents in the workspace. Since all of the
constituents in the left half have now been found in the workspace,
the constituents in the workspace that have been found are left with
the numbers as shown in line e). The third, fourth, fifth and sixth,
seventh, and eighth constituents in the workspace become respectively
the number one, two, three, four, and five constituents in the
workspace. Note that two or more constituents in the workspace may be
given one number if they are referred to by a dollar sign in the left
half.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is possible for the left half to be modified to some extent by what
is found in the workspace.  This can be done by writing a 'number' as
a constituent in the left half. The number then refers to the
constituent already found in the workspace that has been given that
number.  The rest of the left half is then executed as if the
constituent referred to in the workspace had been written originally
in the left half in place of the number. A number written in the left
half can only refer to a constituent in the workspace that has already
been found by a constituent to the left of it in the left half. It can
refer only to a single constituent, one matched by $1 for example. A
number written in the left half cannot have subscripts written on it.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Figure 8 gives an example of the use of a number in the left
half. After two unsuccessful matches, the number one constituent in
the left half finds the third constituent in the workspace.  The
number two constituent in the left half is then considered to be
replaced by this constituent that has just been found (C/S). The match
then fails because the fourth constituent in the workspace does not
have at least the subscript S, required for a match condition. But
when the number one constituent in the left half finally finds the
sixth constituent in the workspace, the number two constituent in the
left half is considered to be replaced by this constituent &#169;, and
the next match is successful because this C will, according to the
conditions for a match, find the C/S that is next in the workspace.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The English reading of the left half is the same as the reading of the
material in the workspace except that it starts with ", search for a
match in the workspace for", ends with ",and if not found, go to the
next rule, but if found ", and includes conventional wordings for
several abbreviations including the dollar signs and the numbers. For
example, A/.G3 + $1 + $ + $2 + 2 in the left half would be read: ",

/the symbol A/with/the numerical subscript/greater than/3/, followed
by/a constituent consisting of/any symbol/, followed by /a constituent
consisting of/any number of constituents/, followed by/a constituent

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The function of the 'right half' is to indicate how the structures

no right half, the structures found in the workspace are left
unaltered.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>'Rearrangement' of the constituents found by the left half and
temporarily numbered will take place when the appropriate numbers are
written in the right half in the desired new order. If any of the
numbers referring to constituents in the workspace are not written,
these constituents will be deleted. The single digit zero as the only
constituent in the right half will cause everything found by the left

<p>The computer will 'add or alter subscripts' when they are written on a
constituent or number in the right half. If this constituent already
has a logical subscript with the same subscript name as the one that
is being added, the two subscripts are combined in a special way
called 'dispatcher logic'. If there is no overlap in values, that is,
if the two subscripts do not have any values in common, the old
subscript is replaced by the new one. But if the two subscripts have
any values in common, only the values that are common to the two will

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A logical subscript written in the right half with *C in place of its
values complements the values of the subscript found in the workspace,
that is, all the values that it has are replaced by just those values
that it doesn&#8217;t have. In other words, *C effectively adds a minus sign
in front of the subscript values. In the case of numerical subscripts,
the new value replaces, increases, or decreases the old depending on
whether the value written in the right half follows the period
immediately or with an intervening I or D. Since numbers are treated
modulo 2^15, 1 added to 2^15 - 1 will give 0, and 1 subtracted from 0
will give 2^15 - l. Subscripts will be 'deleted' from a constituent
when they are preceded by minus signs in the right half. A dollar sign
preceded by a minus sign will cause all subscripts on that constituent
to be deleted.  Subscripts are added, altered, or deleted in the order
from left to right in which they are written in the right half. The
same subscript will be altered several times if several expressions
involving it are written in the right half.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The computer will 'carry over subscripts' from any single numbered
constituent in the workspace to any other single numbered constituent
indicated by the right half. For this purpose a subscript name in the
right half is followed by an asterisk and a number indicating the
number of the constituent from which the subscript is to be carried
over. Carried over subscripts go onto the new constituent in the order
from left to right in which they are written in the right
half. Logical subscripts go onto the new constituent with dispatcher
logic. Numerical subscripts carried over either replace, increase, or
decrease the old value depending on whether . or .I. or .D. precedes
the asterisk.  A dollar sign preceding the asterisk will cause all the
subscripts from the indicated constituent to be carried over.</p>

The B subscript is carried over from the number one constituent,
the D subscript, not being mentioned, remains unaltered. The E

The G subscript is deleted. Finally, a new constituent is added to the

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The function of the 'routing section' of the rule is to alter the

the computer to search a list, and add or remove plus signs in the
workspace.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>'Dispatcher entries' may be written in the routing section. When the
routing part of the rule is executed by the computer, these entries
are sent to the dispatcher where they combine with the entries there
according to dispatcher logic.  Logical subscripts on a constituent in
the workspace may also be sent to the dispatcher as dispatcher
entries. Conversely, dispatcher entries may be carried over as
subscripts onto a constituent in the workspace. This latter, to return
to the right half for a moment, is done by using the normal notation
for carrying over subscripts but by using the letter D to refer to the
dispatcher. 1 /CASE*D written in the right half would cause the CASE
dispatcher entry to be carried over and added to the number one
constituent in the workspace as a subscript.  2/$*D written in the
right half would cause all of the dispatcher entries to be carried
over as subscripts onto the number two constituent in the
workspace. If the constituent in the workspace already has subscripts
of the same kind, the dispatcher entries are combined with them
according to dispatcher logic.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>'*D' followed by a number in the routing section will cause all of the
subscripts on the indicated numbered constituent in the workspace to
be sent to the dispatcher as dispatcher entries where they combine
with any entries already there according to dispatcher logic. When the
computer executes a rule, subscripts designated in the routing section
of the rule and dispatcher entries written directly in the routing
section of the rule are sent to the dispatcher in the order in which
they are written from left to right in the routing section. This is
done after the left and the right halves are executed and before the
go-to is executed. When subscripts are sent to the dispatcher from the
workspace, they are not deleted from the workspace; when they are sent
to the workspace from the dispatcher, they are not deleted from the
the dispatcher.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>COMIT has a special provision for 'rapid dictionary
search'. Dictionary entries may be written in a list which will be
automatically alphabetized by the computer. This list may be entered
from one or more rules called look-up rules. A look-up rule has two
special features: *L in the routing section of a look-up rule,
followed by one or more numbers referring to consecutively numbered
constituents in the workspace, serves to indicate what structure in
the workspace is to be looked up in a list.  The name of a list,
written in the go-to section of the look-up rule, serves to indicate
what list the structure is to be looked up in. A list cannot be
entered by an automatic transfer of control to the next rule.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When entering a list, the computer temporarily deletes all subscripts
from the constituents in the workspace indicated by the *L, and all
plus signs between the constituents, thus forming one long symbol. It
is this long symbol that is looked up in the list.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The list itself has the following structure: The entries are separate
rules. The first rule of a list has a hyphen followed by the name of
the list in its name section. The rest of the list rules have nothing
in their name sections.  List rules have only one subrule each. The
long symbol formed by a look-up rule is looked up in the left halves
of the list rules. Each left half thus contains only one constituent
with a symbol only and no subscripts. Each list rule may also have a
right half, routing, and go-to. If the long symbol is found in the
list, the corresponding right half is executed in normal fashion. If
the number one is written in the right half of the list rule, the long
symbol remains in the workspace. If the single number zero is written
in the right half, the structure indicated by the look-up rule is
deleted.  If nothing is written in the right half of the list rule,
the items temporarily deleted by the look-up rule are restored and the
workspace remains unaltered. If the long symbol is not found in the
list, the items temporarily deleted by the look-up rule are restored,
leaving the workspace unaltered, and control is automatically
transferred to the first rule after the list.</p>

<p>An example of a list is given in figure 11.  Rule A is the look-up
rule. It serves to find any number of constituents between spaces in
the workspace. (Spaces are indicated in the workspace by hyphens.) If
the workspace does not have two spaces, the left half is not found and
control is transferred to the next rule and then goes to C. If the
indicated structure is found, the symbols of the constituents between
the spaces are formed into one long symbol which is looked up in list
B. If it is not found in the list, control goes to the rule after the
list and then to G.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to the look-up rule with its *L abbreviation, there are
two other ways of altering the number of plus signs in the workspace.
'*K' followed by one or more numbers referring to consecutively numbered
constituents in the workspace will cause the symbols of these
constituents to be compressed into one long symbol, and any subscripts
that they may have had will be lost.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>'*E' followed by one or more numbers referring to consecutively
numbered constituents in the workspace will cause the symbols of these
constituents to be expanded by the addition of plus signs so that each
character becomes a separate constituent. A list of characters is
given in the center column of figure 12. Any subscripts that the
original constituents may have had will be lost.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Only one of the abbreviations *L, *K, or *E may be used in any one
rule, and when it is used, it must be last in the routing section to
avoid confusion in the numbering of the constituents in the workspace.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The COMIT program communicates with the outside world through 'input
and output' functions under control of abbreviations in the routing
section. Reading of input material and writing of output material can
be done in any one of several channels and in any one of several
formats as follows.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>'Channels.' The particular computer that COMIT is being programmed for
(IBM 704) has a number of magnetic tape units connected to it as well
as a card reader and punch and a printer. Magnetic tapes may be
prepared for the computer from information on punched cards, and
material written on tape by the computer may later be read off on a
printer or punched on cards. Each input or output abbreviation
designates that reading or writing is to take place in channel A, B,
C, or one of the others. Then, before the program is run on the
computer, the operator connects the channels used by the programmer to
various magnetic tape units, printers, etc. Any channel may be
connected to any one of several input or output devices. This gives
the maximum of flexibility of operation, and allows the output of one
COMIT program to become the input of another no matter what channels
are designated for input and output in the two programs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The abbreviations *RW in the routing section followed by a channel
designation will rewind the tape unit connected to that channel.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One channel, 'channel M', is reserved for monitoring purposes and cannot
be rewound.  It can only be written on. The COMIT programmer can write
on this channel any information that may be of use to him later
concerning the correct or incorrect operation of his program. Certain
information is also written on this channel automatically if the
machine discovers certain mistakes in the program during operation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Material may be read or written in any one of several
'formats'. Format S (specifiers) involves whole constituents,
including symbols and subscripts. Format A is for text, and involves
only symbols. Both format S and format A are designed for the
particular characters available on the printers and card punches in
current use. Other formats may be made available if and when other
types of input or output equipment become available.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When material is punched on cards for reading into the computer in
'format S', it is punched in exactly the way that it is to appear in the
workspace, including symbols, subscripts, and plus signs between
constituents. Any number of characters up to a maximum of 72 may be
punched on a card. When material extends over onto another card, the
break between cards can be made at any point where a space is allowed,
or anywhere in the middle of a symbol.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the computer executes a rule with an abbreviation in the routing
section that calls for 'reading' in format S from a designated
channel, the next constituent from the input is brought into the
workspace where it replaces the designated numbered constituent. For
example, *RSA2 would cause the computer to read in format S the next
constituent from channel A and send it to the workspace where it will
replace the number two constituent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the computer executes a rule with an abbreviation in the routing
section that calls for 'writing' in format S, the designated numbered
constituents in the workspace are written in the designated
channel. They are not deleted from the workspace by this process. For
example, *WSM3 5 would cause the computer to write in format S in
channel M the number three and the number five constituents from the
workspace.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The computer will start a new line or card each time it executes an
abbreviation calling for writing in format S. Each line requiring more
than 59 characters will end after the next space, fraction bar, or
comma, or before the next plus sign, or after 72 characters, whichever
comes first. Lines are thus usually ended at a natural break.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>'Format' A is for text, and involves only material written in the
symbol sections of constituents . When material is transmitted between
the workspace and the input or output channels under the direction of
an abbreviation in the routing calling for format A, a special
transliteration takes place. The purpose of this transliteration is to
allow all of the characters available on the input and output devices
to be used in the text. Since many of the available characters have
special meanings in the rule — the plus sign separates constituents,
the fraction bar separates symbol from subscripts, and so on — these
must be represented in a different manner when they are written in the
symbol part of a rule if ambiguities are to be eliminated.
Accordingly, format A uses the transliteration scheme presented in
figure 12.</p>

Fig. 12. Format A transliteration table. When the text characters of
column one are read in by an *RA abbreviation, they appear in the
workspace as in column two. When the characters of column two are
written out by an *WA abbreviation, they appear in the output as in
column three.</p>
<p class="tableblock">Note that the characters available for use in symbols consist of the
letters, period, comma, and hyphen, and an asterisk followed by any
character but space.</p>
<p class="tableblock">The first column of figure 12 lists all of the characters available on
the printer and card punch. The second column shows how these
characters appear in the workspace after they have been brought in by
an input operation calling for format A. Note that the letters, period
and comma are brought in unchanged, the space becomes a hyphen in the
workspace, and all other input characters are prefixed by an asterisk
in the workspace. The end of line symbol *.  is brought in after the
last non-space character on the card.</p>
<p class="tableblock">The second column also lists all possible characters that can be
written unambiguously in symbols in a rule. Some of the characters are
single and some are double, consisting of an asterisk followed by
another character.  (An *E expand abbreviation written in the routing
does not insert a plus sign between the asterisk and the other
character of a double character.)</p>
<p class="tableblock">The third column of figure 12 shows how the characters of the second
column will be printed after a write abbreviation calling for format A
has been executed. The hyphen is written as a space, *. is interpreted
as end of line, or carriage return, all other characters are unchanged
except that the asterisk is removed from the double characters. Since
the printer can print a maximum of 120 characters in a line, the
computer will automatically end a line after 120 characters have been
written if the *.  abbreviation has not ended it sooner.</p>
<p class="tableblock">When the computer executes a rule with an abbreviation in the routing
section that calls for reading in format A from a designated channel,
the next character is brought in from the input, transliterated, and
entered into the workspace in place of the designated constituent. For
example, *RAB2 would cause the computer to read in format A the next
character from channel B and send it to the workspace where it will
replace the number two constituent.</p>
<p class="tableblock">When the computer executes a rule with an abbreviation in the routing
section that calls for writing in format A, the symbols from the
designated numbered constituents in the workspace are assembled into a
long symbol, transliterated, and written in the designated channel.
For example, *WAM1 2 4 would cause the computer to write in format A
in channel M the symbols from the number one, two, and four
constituents in the workspace. The workspace remains unchanged in this
process.</p>
<p class="tableblock">The input and output abbreviations used in the routing section of a
rule start with an asterisk followed by R or W for read or write, then
there follows a letter designating format A or S, then a letter
designating a channel, usually A, B, or C (or M in the case of a write
abbreviation only) and finally one number in the case of a read
abbreviation and one or more numbers in the case of a write
abbreviation designating the numbered constituents in the workspace
that are involved. Examples have been given in previous paragraphs.</p>
<p class="tableblock">== Summary ==</p>
<p class="tableblock">This notational system is convenient and well adapted to a large class
of problems including language translation and formal algebraic
manipulation. The computer automatically converts programs in this
notation into actual computer programs. Programs are written in the
notation as a series of rules, each of which may have five parts, the
name, the left half, the right half, the routing, and the go-to.</p>
<p class="tableblock">An arbitrary rule name may be written in the name section of each
rule. In the go-to is written the name of the next rule to be
executed.  The material to be operated on exists in the computer as a
series of constituents in the workspace. The function of the left half
is to indicate which constituents are to be operated on by the
computer. This is done by writing in the left half only enough about
the constituents or their context to uniquely identify them.  In this
way, the same rule can be made to apply in a variety of situations
that are the same in certain respects. There is a convenient way of
locating two or more constituents in the workspace that match each
other in a certain way without having to know what the way is in which
they match.</p>
<p class="tableblock">If the constituents indicated in the left half cannot be found in the
workspace, control goes to the next rule instead of to the rule
mentioned in the go-to. This is one type of program branch.</p>
<p class="tableblock">The function of the right half is to indicate what operations are to
be performed on the constituents found by the left half. It is
possible to add, delete, and rearrange constituents. It is also
possible to add subscripts to any constituents, and to rearrange,
delete, and calculate with them. There are two kinds of subscripts,
numerical subscripts that can be used for counting and simple
arithmetic operations, and logical subscripts that can conveniently be
used for logical calculations. Both types of subscripts may be used in
the left half to help indicate the material to be operated on. They
can thus enter into the condition for a program branch. Logical
subscripts can in addition be sent to the dispatcher where, as
dispatcher entries, they become effective in controlling n-way program
branches. Each dispatcher entry controls which of several subrules is
to be carried out in a given rule.</p>
<p class="tableblock">A third type of program branch is provided by the facility for looking
up material from the workspace in a list expressed as a series of list
rules. This facility can be used for dictionaries. The computer will
automatically alphabetize all material in lists to facilitate the
look-up operation.</p>
<p class="tableblock">The function of the routing section is to control input and output
operations, to control flow of information to and from the dispatcher,
to control list look-up operations, and to bring several constituents
together into one constituent, or separate a constituent into several
constituents, one for each character.</p>
<p class="tableblock">Input and output facilities provide the maximum of convenience for the
user. In addition, the system has a number of checks built in that
will help the programmer find any mistakes he may make in writing his
program.</p>
<p class="tableblock">== How to Read a Rule in COMIT ==</p>
<p class="tableblock">The purpose of this section is to present a summary of the various
conventions used for reading a rule of COMIT in English. The readings
are, of course, purely mnemonic, for they cannot describe completely
what the computer does when it executes the rule.</p>
<p class="tableblock">The various abbreviations used in a rule are tabulated in figure
13. Some abbreviations have several different English readings
depending on what part of the rule they are in. When this is the case,
a note has been inserted in the table to give an indication of the
contexts in which the abbreviation should be given the various
readings.</p>
<p class="tableblock">In addition to the English readings associated with the abbreviations,
there are conventional wordings that are not associated with any
particular abbreviations, but instead with certain positions in the
various sections and parts of the rule. In order to summarize these
conventional wordings, figure 14 presents a sample rule and its
complete reading. The wordings that are associated with the format are
provided with an explanatory note giving the circumstances under which
they are used.</p></td>

<p class="tableblock">The purpose of this section is to present the conventions that must be
adhered to when writing a COMIT rule.</p>
<p class="tableblock">'General:' The left hand 72 columns of the punched card are available
for writing COMIT rules. The other 8 columns can be used for numbering
the cards if so desired. If a rule requires more than 72 columns to
write, a hyphen may be used at the end of one card and the rule
continued on the next card in any column.  To indicate a space between
the hyphenated parts of the rule, leave a space before the hyphen.</p>
<p class="tableblock">Comments enclosed in parentheses are interpreted by the computer as
spaces. No parentheses may be included within a comment. A comment
continued onto the next card should be hyphenated.</p>
<p class="tableblock">'Name section:' The first subrule of a rule has a rule name starting
in column one. A rule that is never referred to by name in a go-to or
in the dispatcher may have an asterisk in column one instead of a
name.</p>
<p class="tableblock">All subrules of a rule with more than one subrule have a subrule
name. The subrule name is separated from the rule name by one or more
spaces, otherwise it starts in any column after the first. A rule can
have a maximum of 36 subrules. If there are several rules with the
same rule name, they must have identical sets of subrule names.</p>
<p class="tableblock">The first rule of a list has a hyphen in column one followed by the
list name. The rest of the rules in a list have nothing in the name
section.</p>
<p class="tableblock">A name consists of 12 or fewer consecutive characters. The characters
available are the letters of the alphabet, the numbers, and the period
and hyphen in medial position, that is not at the beginning or end of
the name.</p>
<p class="tableblock">'Left half:' The first subrule of a rule carries the left half if there
is one. All list rules have a left half and only one subrule. The left
half is separated from the name by one or more spaces, otherwise it
starts in any column after the first.</p></td>

Fig. 15. A tabulation of all the types of subscripts allowed in the
left and the right halves of rules.</p>
<p class="tableblock">When the left half could be confused with a subrule name, it should be
followed by an equal sign to resolve the ambiguity. The possible
ambiguity is between a left half consisting of a symbol with no
subscripts in a rule with no subrule name or right half, and the
subrule name of a first subrule with no left or right half.</p>
<p class="tableblock">The left half consists of one or more constituents separated by plus
signs and optional spaces. A constituent may be a symbol or $1 with or
without subscripts, or it may be a definite or indefinite dollar sign
without subscripts, or it may be a number, without subscripts,
referring to a numbered constituent already found in the workspace.</p>
<p class="tableblock">The left half of a list rule consists of a single constituent composed
of a symbol only.</p>
<p class="tableblock">A symbol is any uninterrupted sequence of characters. A character in a
symbol may be a letter; period, comma, or hyphen, or an asterisk
followed by any character except space.  These latter double
characters are treated as single characters by the <strong>E
abbreviation. The characters have been summarized in figure 12.</p>
<p class="tableblock">If a constituent has subscripts, these follow the symbol and are
separated from it by a fraction bar and optional spaces. Subscripts
are separated from each other by commas and optional spaces.</p>
<p class="tableblock">A logical subscript has a subscript name written like a rule name. If
it has values, these have the form of subrule names and are separated
from it and from each other by one or more spaces. A logical subscript
need not refer to a rule name, but if it does, its Values are
restricted to the subrule names of that rule.</p>
<p class="tableblock">The types of logical and numerical subscript expressions available for
use in the left half are tabulated in figure 15 and indicated by an L.
The table also gives an indication of the meaning of the subscripts
and how the logical subscript values are stored in the computer in
terms of zeros and ones.</p>
<p class="tableblock">'Right half:' Any rule that has a left half may have right halves in its
subrules. Each right half is marked by a preceding equal sign and
optional spaces.</p>
<p class="tableblock">The right half consists of one or more constituents separated by plus
signs and optional spaces. A constituent in the right half may be a
symbol with or without subscripts, or it may be a number, with or
without subscripts, referring to a numbered constituent in the
workspace. The types of logical and numerical subscripts
available for use in the right half are also
listed in figure 15, and indicated by an R.</p>
<p class="tableblock">'Routing section:' The routing section, if written, is preceded by two
fraction bars and optional spaces. In the routing section, dispatcher
entries may be written in the same way that subscripts and values are
written in the right half.  In addition the input abbreviations *RAA,
*RAB, etc., and *RSA, *RSB, etc. may be written followed by a number
designating one numbered constituent in the workspace. The output
abbreviations *WAA, *WAB, etc., and *WSA, *WSB, etc. may be followed
by one or more numbers referring in any order to numbered constituents
in the workspace. The *L, *K, and *E may be written followed by one or
more numbers referring to consecutively numbered constituents in the
workspace. The numbers are separated by one or more spaces. Separate
entries in the routing section are separated by commas and one or more
spaces. Only one *L, *K, or *E abbreviation may be written in any
rule, and it must be the last thing written in the routing section.</p>
<p class="tableblock">'Go-to:' In the go-to is written either the name of the rule or list
that is to be executed next, or an asterisk signifying that the next
rule in sequence is to be executed next. The go-to is separated from
the rest of the rule by one or more spaces.</p>
<p class="tableblock">The author wishes to express his appreciation to S. F. Best,
F. C. Helwig, G. H. Matthews, A. Siegel, and M. R. Weinstein for their
many helpful criticisms and suggestions.</p>
<p class="tableblock">== Appendix ==</p>
<p class="tableblock">=== Some Sample Programs ===</p>
<p class="tableblock">We now present a few simple programs written in COMIT. These programs
have been chosen for their illustrative and pedagogical value. In
order to see how the computer carries out these programs, the reader
may have to keep track of the contents of the workspace and dispatcher
on a separate piece of paper while going through the programs.</p>
<p class="tableblock">The first seven examples show how some simple operations on text can
be carried out.  The first one will bring 25 characters of text into
the workspace from the input. The remaining six will insert position
markers in various places between the characters in the workspace or
make various substitutions or order changes.  The position markers
must be chosen in such a way that they will not be confused with other
constituents.</p>
<p class="tableblock">The ninth example is a simple word-forword translation routine. The
text is brought in a character at a time, and each character is looked
up in a list to see if it is a letter or mark of punctuation. Each
continuous string of letters between punctuation marks or spaces is
looked up in the dictionary. The punctuation marks and spaces are
carried over into the output text unchanged. Any word that is not
found in the dictionary is printed in its original form and enclosed
in parentheses. Alternative meanings are separated by fraction
bars. An output line is printed as soon as a word is translated that
makes the line exceed 55 characters in length. A slight additional
complication would be needed to prevent a line from starting with
a space or mark of punctuation, and to allow
for the hyphenation of long words at the end of
the line.</p>
<p class="tableblock">The eighth example illustrates another class of problems that COMIT is
convenient for, that is, problems of an algebraic or manipulational
nature.</p>
<p class="tableblock">Readers who would like to use the COMIT system should correspond with
the author for further details.</p>
