<h1>Why this page</h1>

<p><a href='http://www.gmtgames.com/cca/main.html'>Commands &amp;
Colors: Ancients</a> is a worthy successor to such old-time
ancient-period wargames as SPI PRESTAGS (Pre-Seventeenth-Century
Tactical Gaming System).  Like them, it does a good job of capturing
period feel and tactics, at least insofar as we can reconstruct them
from historical sources.  It has the advantage of drastically simpler
rules mechanics, and so is easy to learn and quick to play.</p>

<p><cite>C&amp;C:A</cite> has earned a lot of praise and popularity
from wargamers.  Most who have played this game and its siblings using
variants of the same rule system (the original <cite>Battle Cry</cite>
and <cite>Memoir '44</cite>) seem to agree that <cite>C&amp;C:A</cite>
is the best of three remarkably strong games.  But perfect it is not.</p>

<p>While designer Richard Borg's system of using tactical cards to
order units does a far better job of modeling the "fog of war" than most
games manage, sometimes it can be a little too restrictive.
Additionally, a commendable desire to keep the rules simple sometimes
produces results that seem unreasonable.  These problems can be
fixed without much difficulty; this page is partly about how to do 
that.  The rest is notes and reviews on various scenarios.</p>

<h1>House Rules</h1>

<p>C&amp;C:A's design encourages tinkering and variants.  The rules
are written in such a way that it is easy to change things like unit
combat statistics and damage allocation in small ways with relatively
predictable results.</p>

<h2>Leader evade forward</h2>

<p>As written, the rules require leaders who survive a kill check to
evade towards their side's map edge.  You can modify this to allow leaders to
evade sideways or forward if they can move one hex and end their move 
on a friendly unit.</p>

<p><b>I no longer recommend this rule</b>, as I have come to think
it's a good idea to require a lone leader to spend the forward move
needed to reunite with a unit.</p>

<h2>Optional discard</h2>

<p>Give players the option of discarding a card from their hand in
addition to playing one.  When a player does this, their end-of-turn 
draw is two cards rather than one.</p>

<p>I find this eliminates the problem of getting stuck
with cards you can't really use, effectively reducing your hand
size.  Of course, there's an argument that it subverts the designer's
intentions by giving both players more tactical flexibility than they
ought to have.  But it still seems to lead to historically reasonable
results, which suggests it's not bending the system too far out of shape.</p>

<h1>Scenario Notes</h1>

<p>Many of the scenarios aren't very balanced.  They're historical,
and historical battles often weren't.  Because they play quickly, one
way to cope with this is to play each one as a flip-flop set: twice in
a session with the players swapping sides, then adding up total
numbers of flags.</p>

<p>The number before each scenario is the number used for it at the 
<a href="http://www.ccancients.net">CCA fan site</a>; hundreds digit
indicates the expansion (0 for base game) and the low two digits
are the sequence number. The following are fast links to each note:</p>

<h2 id="001">001 Battle of Akragas</h2>

<p>This first scenario is a fairly straightforward
power-vs.-maneuverability confrontation.  If the Syracusan general can
bring his heavy infantry to bear squarely against the opposing line,
he will win.  The Carthaginian must maneuver and hope to pick off
five Syracusan light units before that happens.</p>

<p>I think the advantage is slightly with the Syracusans in this
senario. Their missile troops have better range, which tends to
prevent the Carthaginian skirmishers from doing much to disrupt the
Syracusan heavies.  And the only real mobile striking force Carthage
has is the chariot and light-cavalry pair on his extreme left; a flank
attack against the Syracusan right is thus about the only way Carthage
has to secure the initiative. If that fails and the Syracusan makes no
large exploitable errors afterward, he's got a lock.</p>

<p>I think I might rebalance this by giving the Carthaginians six
command cards rather than five.</p>

<h2 id="002">002 Crimissos River</h2>

<p>Syracusan hoplites try to bushwack a larger Carthaginian force as
it crosses a river.  I think the outcome of this scenario depends a
lot on the luck of the Syracusan draw; the first time I played it, I
got to play two Line Command cards on the first two turns and the
result was a lopsided massacre and rout of the Carthaginians.</p>

<p>The second time I played the Carthaginians.  My card luck was good and
I managed to execute a successful right-flank attack with my Sacred Band 
heavies and chariots.  This destroyed the Syracusan line, but the Sacred
Band was nearly wiped out in the process (down to one block).  I have
to count that as a Carthaginian tactical victory but (given the scenario
conditions) actually a strategic defeat for Carthage.</p>

<h2 id="003">003 Bagradas</h2> 

<p>Carthaginians with 6 cards and 3 elephants against pre-Marian
Romans with just 4 sounds like a slaughter in the making, and that's
how it was historically.  It is actually possible for the Romans to
win this one (I did it), but it requires aggressive use of light
infantry against the elephants and a hard focus on taking out the
Carthaginian cavalry before the lines close.</p>

<p>I still think this one is unbalanced.  I'd give the Romans 5 cards</p>

<h2 id="004">004 Ticinus River</h2> 

<p>This scenario hands the Carthaginians the interesting challenge of
managing an all-cavalry army.  On the one hand, otherwise powerful cards
like Line Command stop being useful.  On the other hand, a Mounted Charge
at the right time can wreak havoc on the Romans.</p>

<p>The Romans have to somehow keep the Carthaginian center from
engaging their light infantry, which simply cannot long survive close
combat with heavy cavalry.  The targets of opportunity for the 
Roman are the light cavalry on the Carthaginian wings &mdash; but, 
because of the evasion mechanic, they have to be attacked from fairly 
far forward before they are likely to take real damage.  The Romans
must, somehow, take the offensive.</p>

<p>I think this scenario tilts towards the Carthaginians.  Giving the
Romans another command card might help.</p>

<h2 id="005">005 Castulo</h2>

<p>Mago's ambush unit adds an unusual touch to what would otherwise 
be a fairly standard line-on-line slugfest.  In my first game I played
the Carthaginians and lost; two Roman Line Commands hemmed me in, and
skillful Roman use of fire combat disrupted my elephants and heavies 
before I could get use of them.

<p>Can't evaluate balance on this one yet; it may be slightly
pro-Roman, or I could merely have that impression because my
opponent's card luck was good. More plays should be revealing.</p>

<h2 id="006">006 Lake Trasimene</h2>

<p>First time I played this one was as a flip-flop set; the score was
6-3/4-6 and I lost.</p>

<p>In neither game did the Roman right/Carthaginian left see any
combat at all.  The Romans have to get their units off the lakeshore
line or be dispersed by forced retreats.  Conversely, the big variable
for the Carthaginians is how quickly the warrior infantry can close
with the Roman line and what damage they do when they get there.</p>

<p>I think this scenario is (despite its complexity) very well
balanced, better so than the Crimissos, Bagradas, or Ticinus River
Scenarios. I wouldn't change a thing.</p>

<h2 id="007">007 Cannae</h2>

<p>I played the Romans in this one, giving the stronger Carthaginian
side to my opponent.  I was, of course, aware of the historical Roman
commander's blunder - overcommitting against a weak center only to be
pinned and crushed from the flanks by the superior Carthaginian
cavalry.  With this order of battle and the Roman's weakness in
cavalry, the only real option seemed to be to repeat Varrus's plan
with beter execution &mdash; hoping to engage the center and inflict
enough unit kills to win before my flanks collapsed.</p>

<p>I got three Line Commands early and used them to move the entire
Roman formation forward as a block. The Carthaginians' right-flank
attack stalled out, and their left-flank attack forced my right flank
back, but it remained in fairly good order.  Crucially, though, Varro
(my right-flank leader) died early.</p>

<p>Then my opponent actually engaged in the center rather than pushing
the right flank attack!  She explained that she wanted to trigger the
main engagement where her units would still have retreat room. But the
weight of my mediums told and after two turns her center was punched
back and shredded.  Then she pressed the attack on my right flank
until it collapsed.  At this point both of us were headhunting units
for the last flag and it was down to dice rolls; she got there first.</p>

<p>I think this scenario is quite unbalanced in favor of the
Carthaginians.  Between their cavalry superiority, two more command
cards, and their lights' ability to evade, they will normally be able
shape the battle pretty much to their liking; the fact that they
almost controlled that shape anyway even with my three lucky Line
Commands is the best possible evidence for this.  The designers set
out to force something not far from the historical movements and
results and succeeded quite well.</p>

<p>To rebalance this, I'd start by giving the Romans competent command
(5 cards).  But it's probably best to play it as a flip-flop set and
give the win to the player with fewest total losses.</p>

<h2 id="008">008 Dertosa (Ebro)</h2>

<p>At first sight this scenario may look pretty seriously unbalanced.
"Just 4 command cards for Carthage?", you'll wonder.  Don't.  Used
properly, the Carthaginian flankers will crush the Romans with ease.
I won this handily, 6 to 1, without moving the Carthaginian infantry
line at all and firing from it exactly once.  Your true
slaughter-makers are the elephants and heavy infantry; waste no
opportunity to move them forward and engage aggressively.</p>

<p>The Romans, on the other hand, want to close with the enemy line.
where their mediums will have the weight advantage.  They need  to
use their light troops to disrupt the enemy cavalry with fire combat; 
this is especially true on the right flank, where the enemy elephants 
will wreak havoc if they aren't maddened into rampage and retreat.</p>

<p>This one plays fast.  Do it as a flip-flop set.</p>

<h2 id="009">009 2nd Beneventum</h2>

<p>Fairly generic Roman vs. Carthaginians brawl, light on the
elephants except for the odd contingency that the Romans go
to 6 cards on their third kill (presumably corresponding to
Consul Gracchus's second speech to the slaves).</p>

<p>I narrowly won my first game playing the Carthaginians, but
cannot draw balance conclusions as card luck was very poor for both
sides and therre were many surprising unit-kill die rolls.</p>

<h2 id="010">010 Castulo</h2>

<p>An interesting scenario that departs from the usual
line-facing-line setup.  More balanced than it appears; it's
neither as easy for the Romans to punch through the Carthaginian
center as it looks, nor easy for the Carthaginians to bring Mago's
forces into the fight.</p>

<p>I played this as the Carthaginians and lost, narrowly.  The Romans 
must play simple offense, keeping their troops in close formation
and not leaving stragglers for the enemy to pick off.  For the
Carthaginians it's a maneuver game; beware the Roman heavies.</p>

<h2 id="011">011 Baecula</h2>

Play this one as a flip-flop set, because it's nearly impossible
for the Carthaginians to win.  I mauled the Roman right flank pretty
seriously by linking Hasdrubal up with a unit of auxulia and attacking
downhill (limiting the Roman mediums' battle-back to 2 dice); my
lights on the ridgeline gave as good as they got; I conducted a
fighting retreat to my camp line in good order; but the relentless
pressure from the flanks eventually told.

<h2 id="012">012 Metaurus</h2>

<p>As with Baecula, play this one as a flip-flop set because it tilts
towards the Romans - I played both sides and the Romans won
convincingly both times.  The disparity in actual combat strength is
small, but it is amplified by the fact that the Carthagibnians get
only 4 command cards to the Romans' 6. If the Carthaginian player gets
lucky a serious elephant-trample through the Roman mediums and heavies
<em>might</em> even the odds.</p>

<p>A side that gets its troops onto the river first and holds a move
card for that flank will have an advantage there, because the opponent
cannot engage other than by moving onto the other river and stopping
first, making itself vulnerable.</p>

<h2 id="109">109 Gaugamela</h2>

<p>This scenario depends on whether Darius can pull off an
envelop-and-crush with the numerically superior Persians before
Alexander punches his heavies straight through, shattering the
required number of units on the way.</p>

<p>The early battle didn't go historically because I'm a much more
aggressive general than Darius.  My heavy chariots, elephant, and
heavy cavalry chewed up the Macedonian center pretty thoroughly,
actually blowing two entire units (including the Companion Cavalry)
out from under Alexander.  And my cavalry was successful on both
flanks, as well.  But the tide began to turn when Alexander joined a
Macedonian heavy infantry unit.  He and Craterus punched straight up
the middle with a line of three heavies and blew Darius off my board
edge.  Finis.</p>

<p>This one is well balanced; Darius being two command cards down
compensates nicely for his numbers advantage.  The Macedonians better
pray he doesn't get a couple of early Line Commands, though; that
could seriously constrain Alexander's room to maneuver.</p>

<h2 id="111">111 Hydaspes River</h2>

<p>Macedonian infantry and cavalry (with Alexander as a special leader)
against Indians with archers and elephants.  This is a big, fun
brawl.  Historically, this is the battle that gave the the Diadochi
(Alexander's generals) a vast desire for elephants in their armies
&mdash; and, in fact, the elephants are key to the battle.  They 
will wreak havoc on the Macedonian mediums and heavies if the 
Macedonian player doesn't learn how to counter with light infantry
harassment tactics.</p>

<p>I got the Indian side. I think the slightly exotic weapons mix
(heavy on longbowmen and elephants) makes it more fun to play, but on
the other hand the Macedonians have the Alexander leader unit.  His
bonus battle die and morale effects make the Companion medium cavalry
he starts with pretty nasty, but there can be worse fates for the
Indian player &mdash; as I found out when I shot the Companions to
ribbons and my opponent moved Alexander onto a heavy infantry unit.  A
six-battle-dice attack is <em>no</em> fun to be on the receiving end
of; it will chew opposing units up pretty fast even when they
evade.</p>

<p>Overall, well balanced.  In my opinion one of the best compositions
anywhere in the GMT scenario books.</p>

<h2 id="114">114 Gabiene</h2>

<p>Elephants on both sides lead to entertaining chaos.  Much of this
scenario depends on just how much havoc each side can wreak with the
things.</p>

<p>I gave my opponent, who was just learning the game, Antigonus and the
command-card advantage.  He promptly ran an elephant into my center,
demolished one unit of heavies, and did half damage to a second.  He 
followed this up by running Peithon's cavalry down to my camp hex for
the extra banner.  It was looking pretty dicey for a while; he was up
4 banners to 0 at one point with two of my elephants gone.  The Silver
Shields and my medium infantry retrieved the situation by punching
through his center.</p>

<p>This one is well balanced, with similar tactical challenges
for both sides and Antigonus's command-card advantage compensating
nicely for Eumenes's slightly higher weight of metal.</p> 

<h2 id="115">115 Ipsus</h2>

<p>This was the so-called "Battle of Kings", a pivotal confrontation in the
Wars of Alexandrian Succession. I played the Seleucids.  Antigonus's
cavalry-heavy right moved aggressively against my left, which is 
what happened historically and completely logical given the order of
battle.  Ahistorically, my left got handled pretty roughly but did
not entirely collapse.  The Antigonids later sortied against my right
flank and knocked it around pretty seriously as well.</p>

<p>As in the original battle, moving my heavy infantry up the center
proved decisive; they inflicted critical losses on the opposing
line. My opponent cooperated by using a line command to move his
center forward; I think, in retrospect, that this was an error.</p>

<p>I think my opponent's attempts at flanking were entirely correct.
The Antigonids need to hit hard, fast, and early while the Seleucids
have no retreat room.  The OB gives the Seleucids a significant
advantage in a general engagement, especially if they can deploy the
elephants in their rear line effectively.</p>

<p>Thus I'd say this scenario favors the Seleucids slightly,
especially since they start with 6 command cards to the Antigonid 5.
I don't think I'd change it, though; good tactics and execution by the
Antigonids can negate the Seleucid advantage, and that challenge 
is what this scenario design is about.</p>
