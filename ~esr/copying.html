<p>Unpleasant but necessary lawyer-fodder: the material on this site
is copyright by Eric S. Raymond.  Except as granted below and
explicitly by licenses on individual documents, all rights under
U.S. copyright law and the Berne Convention (where applicable) are
reserved.</p>

<p>I get a lot of letters from people asking if they can link
to pages on my site, mirror them, do translations, etc.  Here is
my policy:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You may link to any portion of this site that you wish.</p></li>
<li><p>You may mirror any portion of this site that you wish.</p></li>
<li><p>You may <em>not</em> make or redistribute static copies (whether
print or online) without my express permission.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In general, I want lots of people to see my content, and if you
want to help with that I'm happy to let you.  However, I don't like
having old, stale versions of my content floating around on other
peoples' sites.  These rules are mainly designed to try to ensure that
when some third party sees my name on a document, the content reflects 
all my updates to it.</p>

<p>Therefore, I refuse requests from people who want to take one of my
documents, modify it for a particular audience, and redistribute.
Don't even bother asking, because I'll say no.  Instead, write your
document as a discussion of or comment on mine, and include a
link to its home location or a locally mirrored version,</p>

<p>Translations are kind of a special case.  Here are the rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>If you want to do a translation, go ahead, I give permission. I will 
carry a link to it when you send me a URL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want <em>you</em> to host and maintain the translation, not me.
I don't carry translations on my site, because when I do that they
never get updated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't bother asking me if I know about translations to a particular
language; if I know of one, it will be listed with the other
translation links on the document.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must include a link to my original in a prominent place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must conspicuously <em>time-stamp your translation</em>, so that if it
falls behind the evolving English version readers will have some warning.</p>
</li>
</ul>
