		README for coverity-submit

If you are a registered user of Coverity's self-build server 
and have the cov-build tools installed locally, this script
automates the process of running the tools and submitting an
analysis request to Coverity. It can be configured to store
build passwords, local build commands, and other required
information for multiple projects so you don't have to
remember it - just call the tool and let it manage the details.
