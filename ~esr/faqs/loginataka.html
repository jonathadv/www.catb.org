<p><strong>Speak, O Guru: How can I become a Unix
Wizard?</strong></p>

<p>O, Nobly Born: know that the Way to Wizardhood is long, and
winding, and Fraught with Risks. Thou must Attune thyself with the
Source, attaining the arcane Knowledge and Conversation of the
System Libraries and Internals. Yea; and such an all-consuming Time
and Energy Sink is this as to greatly Imperil thy Grade Point
Average (if one thou hast), not to mention thy Sex Life (if one
thou hast). But persevere, oh Larval One; rewards beyond the Dreams
of Lusers await thee!</p>

<p><strong>Speak, O Guru: What books should I study? Are the
O'Reilly "Nutshell" guides a good place to start?</strong></p>

<p>O, Nobly Born: know that the Nutshell Guides are but the
outermost Portal of the True Enlightenment. Worthy are they (and
praise to the Name of O'Reilly, whose books show forth the Hacker
Spirit in numerous pleasing ways), but the Nutshell Guides are only
the Beginning of the Road.</p>

<p>If thou desirest with True Desire to tread the Path of Wizardly
Wisdom, first learn the elementary Postures of Kernighan &amp;
Pike's <cite>The Unix Programming Environment</cite>; then, absorb
the mantic puissance of March Rochkind's <cite>Advanced Unix
Programming</cite> and W. Richard Stevens's <cite>Advanced
Programming In The Unix Environment</cite>.</p>

<p>Immerse thyself, then, in the Pure Light of Maurice J. Bach's
<cite>The Design Of The Unix Operating System</cite>. Neglect not
the Berkelian Way; study also <cite>The Design and Implementation
Of The 4.4BSD Operating System</cite> by Kirk McKusick, Keith
Bostic et. al.</p>

<p>For useful hints, tips, and tricks, see <cite>Unix Power
Tools</cite>, Tim O'Reilly, ed. Consider also the dark Wisdom to be
gained from contemplation of the dread <cite>Portable C And Unix
Systems Programming</cite>, e'en though it hath flowed from the
keyboard of the mad and doomed Malvernite whom the world of
unknowing Man misnames "J. E. Lapin".</p>

<p>These tomes shall instruct thy Left Brain in the Nature of the
Unix System; to Feed the other half of thy Head, O Nobly Born,
embrace also the Lore of its Nurture. Don Libes's and Sandy
Ressler's <cite>Life With Unix</cite> will set thy Feet unerringly
upon that Path; take as thy Travelling Companion the erratic but
illuminating compendium called <cite>The New Hacker's
Dictionary</cite> (Eric S. Raymond, ed., with Guy L. Steele
Jr.).</p>

<p>(In this wise shalt thou travel the Way of the Camel.)</p>

<p><strong>Speak, O Guru: To attain Mastery, how many Kernels do I
need to take apart and reassemble?</strong></p>

<p>O Nobly Born: this question reveals that indeed thou hast
touched upon an Ineffable Truth about Unix --- that thou canst not
Plumb its Mysteries by mere Study but must become One with it
through Practice. The true Way to the Knowledge of the Source is
not the timid and footling way of the Student, but the Divine
Foolery of the Hacker. Hack, then; strive against Mighty Problems,
have joy in thy Striving, and let the Crashes fall where they may
(maintaining the while, for the Good of thy Karma, a Rigorous
Backup Policy).</p>

<p>In this day of Boot-Time Autoconfiguration and Dynamically
Loadable Device Drivers, reassembling a Kernel is no longer the
daunting Test and Seal of Mastery that once it was. However,
writing and verifying thine own Device Driver for some piece of
Exotic Hardware is still a worthy challenge to thy Budding
Guruhood. Indeed, such Challenge may be found the Crafting of any
Program sufficiently Powerful to Extend or Compete with the Tools
now available in Open Source.</p>

<p>Therefore: seek thee out the Open Source Unixes: OpenBSD,
FreeBSD, NetBSD, and most Especially Linux in many of its
Incarnations. Join the Wizards and Aspirants to Wizardhood who
Labor Unceasingly to Improve these. Commune with them in their
Great Work, their unceasing Extension and Reinvention of Unix. In
this wise may thou become one among the Mighty.</p>

<p><strong>Speak, O Guru: Some there are who claim that the sole
Path to Wizardry and the proper Way of every Right-Thinking Hacker
is to rewrite the Unix Kernel from Scratch. Is this not
Sacrilege?</strong></p>

<p>Sacrilege, O Nobly Born? Nay! Certainly the Kernel Source is the
Inmost Mystery of Unix --- but there is a Mystery beyond that
Mystery. The Nature of Unix inhereth not in any one Version but in
the Design Tradition of which all Unixes are Evolving Parts.</p>

<p>The Rite of the Rewrite is not the only Path to Mastery, but it
is perhaps the highest and most Sacred of all Paths. Few indeed are
those who, travelling it, have crossed the dark and yawning Abyss
of Implementation to Delivery. Many, yea, many in truth stagnate
yet in the Desert of Delay, or linger ever in the ghastly limbo
called Perpetual Beta.</p>

<p>(In this wise shalt thou travel the Way of the Lion.)</p>

<p><strong>Speak, O Guru: What, then, is the True Path to
Wizardhood?</strong></p>

<p>O Nobly Born: learn, and seek within thyself. Cultivate the
cunning of the Serpent and the courage of the Tiger; sup deeply
from the Wisdom of those who came before thee. Hack, and hack
again; grow, by trial and by error. Post thy best hacks to the Net
and gain in Repute thereby. Also, O Nobly Born, be thou grave and
courteous in thy speech; be helpful to those less than thee, quick
to succour and slow to flame.</p>

<p>If thou dost these things faithfully, if thou travellest with
high heart and pure intention, soon shall thy callow Newbiehood be
shed. By degrees imperceptible to thyself shalt thou gain Power and
Wisdom, Striving and Doing all the while. Gradually shall thy
Puissance unfold and deepen.</p>

<p>O Nobly Born, if thou dost all these things, thy Wizardhood
shall surely come upon thee; but not of a sudden, and not until
after thy arrogant Mind hath more than half Forgotten that such was
its Aim. For know this --- you may not by thyself in Pride claim
the Mantle of Wizardry; that way lies only Bogosity without
End.</p>

<p>Rather must you Become, and Become, and Become, until Hackers
respect thy Power, and other Wizards hail thee as a Brother or
Sister in Wisdom, and you wake up and realize that the Mantle hath
lain unknown upon thy Shoulders since you knew not when.</p>

<p>(In this wise shalt thou travel the Way of the Child.)</p>

<p>Hear, O nobly born: Techniques can be taught, but the Way of the
Hacker cannot be taught. Skills can be acquired, but the Way of the
Hacker is not a checklist of skills. Programming can be accomplished,
but the Way of the Hacker is not a place at which you can stop and say
"I have arrived!"</p>

<p>Hear, O nobly born: The Way of the Hacker is a posture of mind; he who
seeks a teacher of the Way knows it not, but he is only looking for a
mirror. All those competent to teach the Way know that it cannot
be taught, only pursued with joyous labor and by emulation of the
great hackers of the past.</p>

<p>Hear, O nobly born: Great were the hackers of the past! Subtle and
deep in their thinking, shaggy-bearded and with thunder on their
brows! You may seek to become as them, but it will not suffice you to
grow a beard.</p>

<p>Hear, O Nobly Born: The center of the mystery is the act of coding. You
have a keyboard before you; pursue the Way through work.</p>

<h1 class="c1">SHANTIH! SHANTIH! SHANTIH!</h1>

<h1>Annotations:</h1>

<p>Most of this (up to "(In this wise shalt thou travel the Way of the
Child.)") was originally a Usenet response to some eager newbie
questions; it appears that I wrote it on 21 November 1992 in response
to a post by one Ade Barkah.  After ten years, I guess it's time to
draw aside the veil of those mysteries.  The remainder I wrote in 2010
after I was actually asked to give an answer in the style of the
Loginataka.</p>

<p>For those of you who are not native English speakers, the entirety
is written in imitation of the Early Modern English of the late 1500s
and early 1600s, the language of the King James Bible.  The influence
of the King James Bible is such that its dialect has retained
connotations of majesty, solemnity, and religious authority.  Holy
scriptures from other languages are, therefore, often translated into
a KJB-like pseudo-archaic English rather than following modern
usage.</p>

<para>Parts of this border on obsolescence now.  <cite>Portable C And
Unix Systems Programming</cite> has been out of print for a long time,
but the Lovecraft joke was too funny to lose.  <cite>Life With
Unix</cite> is history, too, but the other references are still good.
In 1998 I changed references to "freeware" and "free software" to
"open source".  Otherwise changes have been pretty minor.</p>

<dl>
<dt>"Loginataka"</dt>
<dd><p>The title of the document is a play on the name of the
<cite>Tripitaka</cite>, an early compilation of Buddhist scriptures.</p></dd>

<dt>"Oh Nobly Born:"</dt>
<dd><p>The formulaic use of the salutation is
intended to be reminiscent of the <cite>Bardo Th&ouml;d&ouml;l</cite>
&mdash; the Tibetan <cite>Book Of The Dead</cite>.</p></dd>

<dt><p>"the Name of O'Reilly"</p>
<dd><p>A phrase rich with meaning in the clan system of old Scotland and
Ireland.  It might refer to the reputation of the clan O'Reilly, or to
the person of the clan chief. The implied image is of Tim O'Reilly, 
be-tartaned, surrounded by louring Celts bristling with weapons. It's
worth noting that O'Reilly and Associates was pretty new at the game
when I wrote this; it was over the following five years that they built 
up their remarkable reputation as friends of the hacker community.</p></dd>

<dt><p>"attaining the arcane Knowledge and Conversation"</dt>
<dd><p>This is a reference to the occultism of Alesteir Crowley.  He wrote of 
attaining the "Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel"
as the central aim of Thelemic mysticism, and added that he had
chosen that term for it because it was the most absurd locution he could
think of.</p></dd>  

<dt>"the Pure Light"</dt>
<dd><p>In Buddhist mysticism, the Pure Light of the Void ("void" being
the usual English translation of Sanskrit <i>sunyata</i>) is a frequent
metaphor for the wisdom that comes from realizing the emptiness of all
things.</p></dd>
</dl>

<dt>"the Berkelian Way"</dt>
<dd><p>If you caught the previous reference to <i>sunyata</i>, you
might also recall that Bishop Berkeley famously denied the existence
of objective reality.</p></dd>

<dt>"the mad and doomed Malvernite"</dt>
<dd><p>This is a play on H.P. Lovecraft's "mad and doomed Arab", Abdul
al-Hazred, the author of the <cite>Necronomicon</cite>.  And the
actual doomed Malvernite was...er...me, in 1987.  The "world of
unknowing man misnames" because I wrote the book, but was
pressured into allowing it to be published under a corporate
pseudonym.</p></dd>

<dt>"feed the other half of thy head"</dt>
<dd><p>Cue Grace Slick, in the last lines of Jefferson Airplane's <cite>White
Rabbit</cite>, a song about a hallucinogenic drug experience:
"Remember...what the dormouse said! FEED YOUR HEAD!  FEED YOUR HEAD!"</p></dd>

<dt>"the Way of the Camel"</dt> <dd><p>The references to the Ways of
the Camel, Lion, and Child are to a mystical rant in Nietzsche's <a
href='http://philosophy.eserver.org/nietzsche-zarathustra.txt'>Thus Spoke
Zarathustra</a>.</p></dd>

<dt>"Divine Foolery of the Hacker"</dt> <dd><p>The image of the Fool
of God is a pervasive one in world mysticism.  I was thinking here
especially of the Fool card in the Rider-Waite Tarot, showing a clown
walking or capering at the edge of a precipice.</p></dd>

<dt>"Great Work"</dt>
<dd><p>In alchemy, the production of the Philosopher's Stone that could
transmute lead to gold, confer immortality.  In some mystical interpretations
of alchemy, the transmutation of the adept's own soul.  Modern Hermetic 
occultism generalizes the second meaning.</p></dd>

<dt>"Desert of Delay"
<dd><p>This part is intended to recall the landscapes in Bunyan's moral
allegory <cite>Pilgrim's Progress</cite>.</p></dd>

<dt>"cunning of the Serpent and the courage of the Tiger"</dt>
<dd><p>In the New Testament of the Christian Bible, Matthew 10:16
exhorts Christians to be as cunning as serpents and as harmless as
doves. This in turn refers to the "cunning of the serpent" in the Old
Testament Book of Genesis.</p></dd>

<dt>"if thou travellest with high heart and pure intention"</dt>
<dd><p>In the <cite>Egyptian Book Of The Dead</cite>, "I have travelled
here with high heart and pure intention" is part of the ritual one
must speak to pass the Weigher of Souls.</p></dt>

<dt>"Shantih!"</dt>
<dd><p>"Shanti!" is Sanskrit and means "Peace!" I deliberately used
the older transliteration "Shantih!" because it's found at the end of
T.S.  Eliot's poem <cite>The Wasteland</cite>. The threefold
repetition is a form of invocatory magic closely equivalent to the Catholic 
ritual blessing "Peace be with you!"</p></dd>
