<h1>I. Introduction</h1>

<p>The neopagan phenomenon is a loose collection of religious
movements, experiments, and jokes combining some very new thinking
with some very old sources.</p>

<p>This FAQ, originally prepared in 1992 at the request of a number
of curious net.posters, offers a brief description of neopagan
thought and practice. A couple of good sources for further study
are listed near the end.</p>

<h1>II. What is a neopagan?</h1>

<p>I used the term `religious' above, but as you'll see it's
actually more than somewhat misleading, and I (like many other
neopagans) use it only because no other word is available for the
more general kind of thing of which the neopagan movement and what
we generally think of as `religion' are special cases.</p>

<p>Neopaganism is `religious' in the etymological sense of `re
ligare', to rebind (to roots, to strengths, to the basics of
things), and it deals with mythology and the realm of the
`spiritual'. But, as we in the Judeo/Christian West have come to
understand `religion' (an organized body of belief that connects
the `supernatural' with an authoritarian moral code via `faith')
neopaganism is effectively and radically anti-religious. I
emphasize this because it is important in understanding what
follows.</p>

<p>Common characteristics of almost all the groups that describe
themselves as `neopagan' (the term is often capitalized or
hyphenated) include:</p>

<h2>1. Anti-dogmatism</h2>

<p>Neopagan religions are religions of practice, pragmatism and
immediate experience. The emphasis is always on what they can help
the individuals in them to <em>do</em> and <em>experience</em>;
theology and metaphysics take a back seat, and very little `faith'
or `belief' is required or expected. In fact many neopagans
(including yours truly) are actively hostile to `faith' and all the
related ideas of religious authority, `divine revelation' and the
like.</p>

<h2>2. Compatibility with a scientific world-view</h2>

<p>This tends to follow from the above. Because neopaganism is
centered in experiences rather than beliefs, it doesn't need or
want to do vast overarching cosmologies or push fixed Final Answers
to the Big Questions -- understanding and helping human beings
relate to each other and the world as we experience it is quite
enough for us. Thus, we are generally friendly to science and the
scientific world-view. Many of us are scientists and technologists
ourselve (in fact, by some counts, a plurality of us are computer
programmers!).</p>

<h2>3. Reverence for nature, sensuality, and pleasure</h2>

<p>Most neopaganisms make heavy use of nature symbolism and
encourage people to be more aware of their ties to all the
non-human life on this planet. Explicit worship of `Gaia', the
earth ecosphere considered as a single interdependent unit, is
common. Veneration of nature dieties is central to many traditions.
Ecological activism is often considered a religious duty, though
there is much controversy over what form it should take.</p>

<p>By preference, most neopagans hold their ceremonies outdoors
under sun or moon. Seasonal changes and astronomical rhythms
(especially the solstices, equinoxes and full and new moons) define
the ritual calendar.</p>

<p>Ritual and festive nudity are common; to be naked before nature
is often considered a holy and integrating act in itself. Sex is
considered sacramental and sexual energy and symbolisms permeate
neopagan practice (we like to contrast this with Christianity, in
which the central sacrament commemorates a murder and climaxes in
ritual cannibalism).</p>

<h2>4. Polytheism, pantheism, agnosticism</h2>

<p>Most neopaganisms are explicitly polytheistic -- that is, they
recognize pantheons of multiple dieties. But the reality behind
this is more complex than it might appear.</p>

<p>First, many neopagans are philosophical agnostics or even
atheists; there is a tendency to regard `the gods' as Jungian
archetypes or otherwise in some sense created by and dependent on
human belief, and thus naturally plural and observer-dependent.</p>

<p>Secondly, as in many historical polytheisms, there is an
implicit though seldom-discussed idea that all the gods and
goddesses we deal with are `masks', refractions of some underlying
unity that we cannot or should not attempt to approach
directly.</p>

<p>And thirdly, there is a strong undercurrent of pantheism, the
belief that the entire universe is in some important sense a
responsive, resonating and sacred whole (or, which is different and
subtler, that it is useful for human beings to view it that
way).</p>

<p>Many neopagans (including yours truly) hold all three of these
beliefs simultaneously.</p>

<h2>5. Decentralized, non-authoritarian organization</h2>

<p>Neopagans have seen what happens when a priesthood elite gets
temporal power; we want none of that. We do not take collections,
build temples, or fund a full-time clergy. In fact the clergy-laity
distinction is pretty soft; in many traditions, all members are
considered `in training' for it, and in all traditions every
participant in a ritual is an active one; there are and can be no
pew-sitting passive observers.</p>

<p>Most neopagan traditions are (dis)organized as horizontal
networks of small affinity groups (usually called `circles',
`groves', or `covens' depending on the flavor of neopagan
involved). Priests and priestesses have no real authority outside
their own circles (and sometimes not much inside them!), though
some do have national reputations and influence.</p>

<p>Many of us keep a low profile partly due to a real fear of
persecution. Too many of our spiritual ancestors were burned, hung,
flayed and shot by religions that are still powerful for a lot of
us to feel safe in the open. Down in the Bible Belt the burnings
and beatings are still going on, and the media loves to hang that
`Satanist' label on anything it doesn't understand for a good juicy
story.</p>

<p>Also, we never prosyletize. This FAQ is about as active a
neopagan solicitation as anyone will ever see; we tend to believe
that `converts' are dangerous robots and that people looking to be
`converted' aren't the kind we want. We have found that it works
quite well enough to let people find us when they're ready for what
we have to teach.</p>

<h2>6. Reverence for the female principle</h2>

<p>One of the most striking differences between neopagan groups and
the religious mainstream is the wide prevalence (and in some
traditions dominance) of the worship of goddesses. Almost all
neopagans revere some form of the Great Mother, often as a nature
goddess identified with the ecosphere, and there are probably more
female neopagan clergy than there are male.</p>

<p>Most neopagan traditions are equalist (these tend to pair the
Great Mother with a male fertility-god, usually some cognate of the
Greek Pan). A vocal and influential minority are actively feminist,
and (especially on the West Coast) there have been attempts to
present various neopagan traditions as the natural `women's
religion' for the feminist movement. The effects of this kind of
politicization of neopaganism are a topic of intense debate within
the movement and fuel some of its deepest factional divisions.</p>

<h2>7. Respect for art and creativity</h2>

<p>Neopaganism tends to attract artists and musicians as much as it
attracts technologists. Our myth and ritual can be very powerful at
stimulating and releasing creativity, and one of the greatest
strengths of the movement is the rich outgrowth of music, poetry,
crafts and arts that has come from that. It is quite common for
people joining the movement to discover real talents in those areas
that they never suspected.</p>

<p>Poets and musicians have the kind of special place at neopagan
festivals that they did in pre-literate cultures; many of our
best-known people are or have been bards and songsmiths, and the
ability to compose and improvise good ritual poetry is considered
the mark of a gifted priest(ess) and very highly respected.</p>

<h2>8. Eclecticism</h2>

<p>"Steal from any source that doesn't run too fast" is a neopagan
motto. A typical neopagan group will mix Greek, Celtic and Egyptian
mythology with American Indian shamanism. Ritual technique includes
recognizable borrowings from medieval ceremonial magic, Freemasonry
and pre-Nicene Christianity, as well as a bunch of 20th-century
inventions. Humanistic psychology and some of the more replicable
New Age healing techniques have recently been influential. The
resulting stew is lively and effective, though sometimes a bit hard
to hold together.</p>

<h2>9. A sense of humor</h2>

<p>Neopagans generally believe that it is more dangerous to take
your religion too seriously than too lightly. Self-spoofery is
frequent and (in some traditions) semi-institutionalized, and at
least one major neopagan tradition (Discordianism, known to many on
this net) is <em>founded</em> on elaborate spoofery and started out
as a joke.</p>

<p>One of the most attractive features of the neopagan approach is
that we don't confuse solemnity with gloom. Our rituals are
generally celebratory and joyous, and a humorous remark at the
right time need not break the mood.</p>

<p>We generally feel that any religion that can't stand to have fun
poked at it is in as sad shape as the corresponding kind of
person.</p>

<h2>III. What kinds of neopagan are there, and where did they come
from?</h2>

<p>Depending on who you talk to and what definitions you use,
conservative estimates are that there are between 40,000 and
200,000 neopagans in the U.S.; the true figure may be much higher
(with some estimates being into the millions), and the movement is
still growing rapidly following a major population explosion in the
late 1970s.</p>

<p>The numerically largest and most influential neopagan group is
the `Kingdom of Wicca' -- the modern witch covens. Modern
witchcraft has nothing to do with Hollywood's images of the
cackling, cauldron-stirring crone (though Wiccans sometimes joke
about that one) and is actively opposed to the psychopathic
Satanism that many Christians erroneously think of as `witchcraft'.
Your author is an initiate Wiccan priest and coven leader of long
standing.</p>

<p>Since the mid-1980s various forms of Druidic revivalism focusing
on Celtic mythology have built vigorousand well-organized networks
(many of these groups are affiliates or offshoots of the New
Reformed Druids of North America). Other important subgroups
include those seeking to revive Norse, Egyptian, Amerind, and
various kinds of tribal pantheons other than the Greek and Celtic
ones that have been incorporated into Wicca. These generally
started out as Wiccan offshoots or have been so heavily influenced
by Wiccan ritual technique that their people can work comfortably
in a Wiccan circle and vice- versa.</p>

<p>There are also the various orders of ceremonial magicians, most
claiming to be the successors to the turn-of-the-century Golden
Dawn or one of the groups founded by Alesteir Crowley during his
brillant and notorious occult career. These have their own very
elaborate ritual tradition, and tend to be more intellectual, more
rigid, and less nature-oriented. They are sometimes reluctant to
describe themselves as neopagans.</p>

<p>The Discordians (and, more recently, the Discordian-offshoot
Church of the Sub-Genius) are few in number but quite influential.
They are the neopagan movement's sacred clowns, puncturing pretense
and adding an essential note to the pagan festivals. Many Wiccans,
especially among priests and priestesses, are also Discordians and
will look you straight in the eye and tell you that the entire
neopagan movement is a Discordian hoax...</p>

<p>Until around 1980 Neopaganism was largely a white,
upper-middle-class phenomenon, but that has been changing rapidly
since. So called `new-collar' workers came in in droves during the
eighties. We still see fewer non-whites, proportionately, than
there are in the general population, but that is also changing
(though more slowly). With the exception of a few nut-fringe
`Aryan' groups detested by the whole rest of the movement,
neopagans are actively anti-racist; prejudice is not the problem,
it's more that the ideas have tended to be accepted by the more
educated segments of society first, and until recently those more
educated segments were mostly white.</p>

<p>On the East Coast, a higher-than-general-population percentage
of neopagans have Roman Catholic or Jewish backgrounds, but figures
suggest this is not true nationwide. There is also a very
significant overlap in population with science-fiction fandom and
the Society for Creative Anachronism.</p>

<p>Politically, neopagans are distributed about the same as the
general population, except that whether liberal or conservative
they tend to be more individualist and less conformist and
moralistic than average. It is therefore not too surprising that
the one significant difference in distribution is the presence of a
good many more libertarians than one would see in a same-sized
chunk of the general population (I particularly register this
because I'm a libertarian myself, but non-libertarians have noted
the same phenomenon). These complexities are obscured by the fact
that the most politically active and visible neopagans are usually
ex-hippie left-liberals from the 1960s.</p>

<p>I think the most acute generalization made about pagans as a
whole is Margot Adler's observation that they are mostly self-made
people, supreme individualists not necessarily in the assertive or
egoist sense but because they have felt the need to construct their
own culture, their own definitions, their own religious paths, out
of whatever came to hand rather than accepting the ones that the
mainstream offers.</p>

<h1>IV. Where do I find out more?</h1>

<p>I have deliberately not said much about mythology, or specific
religious practice or aims, or the role of magic and to what extent
we practice and 'believe' in it. Any one of those is a topic for
another posting; but you can get a lot of information from books.
Here's a basic bibliography:</p>

<p>Adler, Margot; <cite>Drawing Down the Moon</cite> (Random House
1979, hc)</p>

<p>This book is a lucid and penetrating account of who the modern
neo-pagans are, what they do and why they do it, from a woman who
spent almost two years doing observer-participant journalism in the
neo-pagan community. Especially valuable because it combines an
anthropologist's objectivity with a candid personal account of her
own feelings about all she saw and did and how her ideas about the
neo-pagans changed under the impact of the experiences she went
through. Recommended strongly as a first book on the subject, and
it's relatively easy to find. There is now a revised and expanded
second edition available.</p>

<p>Starhawk; <cite>The Spiral Dance</cite></p>

<p>An anthology of philosophy, poetry, training exercises, ritual
outlines and instructive anecdotes from a successful working coven.
First-rate as an introduction to the practical aspects of magick
and running a functioning circle. Often findable at feminist
bookstores.</p>

<p>Shea, Robert and Wilson, Robert Anton <cite>Illuminatus!</cite>
(Dell, 1975, pb)</p>

<p>This work of alleged fiction is an incredible
berserko-surrealist rollercoaster that <em>will</em> bend your mind
into a pretzel with an acid-head blitzkrieg of plausible,
instructive and enlightening lies and a few preposterous and
obscure truths. Amidst this eccentric tale of world-girdling
conspiracies, intelligent dolphins, the fall of Atlantis, who
<em>really</em> killed JFK, sex, drugs, rock and roll and the
Cosmic Giggle Factor, you will find Serious Truths about Mind,
Time, Space, the Nature of God(dess) and What It All Means -- and
also learn why you should on no account take them Seriously. Pay
particular attention to Appendix Lamedh ("The Tactics of Magick"),
but it won't make sense until you've read the rest.</p>

<p>This was first published in 3 volumes as <cite>The Eye In The
Pyramid</cite>, <cite>The Golden Apple</cite> and
<cite>Leviathan</cite>, but there's now a one-volume trade
paperback carried by most chain bookstores under SF.</p>

<p>Campbell, Joseph W., <cite>The Masks of God</cite> (Viking
Books, 1971, pb)</p>

<p>One of the definitive analytical surveys of world mythography --
and readable to boot! It's in 4 volumes: <cite>Primitive
Mythology</cite>, <cite>Oriental Mythology</cite>, <cite>Occidental
Mythology</cite>, and <cite>Creative Mythology</cite>.</p>

<p>The theoretical framework of these books is a form of pragmatic
neo-Jungianism which has enormously influenced the neopagans (we
can accurately be described as the practice for which Campbell and
Jung were theorizing). Note especially his predictions in vols. I
&amp; IV of a revival of shamanic, vision-quest-based religious
forms. The recent Penguin pb edition of this book should be
available in the Mythology and Folklore selection of any large
bookstore.</p>

<p>Bonewits, Isaac, <cite>Real Magic</cite> (Creative Arts Books,
1979, pb)</p>

<p>A fascinating analytical study of the psychodynamics of ritual
and magick. This was Bonewits's Ph.D. thesis for the world's only
known doctorate in Magic and Thaumaturgy (UC Berkeley, 1971).
Hardest of the five to find but well worth the effort -- an
enormously instructive, trenchant and funny book.</p>
