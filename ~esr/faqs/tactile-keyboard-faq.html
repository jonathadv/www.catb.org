<div id="content">
<div id="preamble">
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>This io intended to be an easy introduction to tactile keyboards with links to
more in-depth documents.  A glossary of frequently-used jargon terms
is included.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_what_is_a_tactile_keyboard">What is a tactile keyboard?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>A keyswitch is <em>tactile</em> if it has a bump in its response to finger
pressure at or near the engagement point where the keypress registers
and <em>before</em> the key bottoms out at the end of its travel.  A keyboard
is tactile if it is made with tactile keyswitches.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The mass-market keyboards shipped with most computers are not
tactile. Until the mid-1990s they used to be; then computer
manufacturers discovered that it was possible to manufacture keyboards
much more cheaply using rubber-dome switches that give no
feedback. So-called "soft-touch" keyboards became the norm.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_why_tactile_keyboards">Why tactile keyboards?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Why a tactile keyboard?  Why not settle for soft-touch?</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The fundamental reason is ergonomic.  Tactile feedback makes it
possible for a typist to stop pushing down before the keys bottom out,
reducing total effort by up to a (measured) factor of two.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The lowered effort substantially reduces the risk of RSI, and there
field evidence that people with RSI may achieve reduction in symptoms
or even complete remission of RSI by using tactile-feedback devices.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Even people without RSI often find they can type faster and more
accurately on tactile devices than on dome-switch keyboards that don&#8217;t
supply anything but slight uniform resistance or a meaningless click
before they bottom out.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Some tactile keyboards are marketed as high-end equipment to
serious on-line gamers. The reduced effort is believed (rightly
or wrongly) to shave precious milliseconds off one&#8217;s response time.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There&#8217;s a little more to tactile-keyboard fandom than than ergonomics,
though.  Like tribes that have formed around other classic designs,
the tactile, mechanical-switch keyboard has become a marker for
traditions and attitudes that evolved along with it, including a
certain reverence for timeless excellence in engineering, a belief
that paying more for quality is worth it, and a disdain for competing
designs that, while putatively more <em>modern</em>, are felt to be cheap and
junky and ephemeral by comparison.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The archetype of the tactile keyboard, the Model M, is both tactile
and clicky; that is, it gives not just touch feedback but an audible
keypress sound as well.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The model M is particularly favored by old-school computer hackers
(and by people who want to be like them) as a timeless classic of
design, and a vast improvement over most of its successors. A close
parallel to this community of feeling elsewhere is the cult of the
1911-pattern .45ACP among pistol shooters.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>But the Model M is not the only tactile keyboard. Hallf a dozen small
companies produce mechanical-switch keyboards with varying degrees of
tactility. These are sometimes less expensive than a model M and come
with fancy featrures like LED backlights and media keys, but are not
usually anywhere near as long-lasting.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Beware, though, of some tradeoffs.  Tactile keyboards are relatively
expensive to manufacture, rugged, and can last a long time (it is not
all that unusual to see 35-year-old model Ms still in use, having
outlasted generations of computers).  Because of this and the fact
that they&#8217;re a minority preference, making a profit on them is
difficult. Vendors tend to be boutique operations with very little
engineering budget; the devices are made only in small runs and thus
sell at boutique prices.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Despite these inconveniences, most tactile-keyboard fans will never
willingly use a non-tactile keyboard.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A tactile keyboard is most likely to benefit you if you&#8217;re a
computer programmer, writer, or in some other job that requires
you to type day-in and day-out.  Affection for tactile keyboards
is particularly common and strong among programmers.</p></div>

<h2 id="_what_are_the_different_kinds_of_tactile_keyboards">What are the different kinds of tactile keyboards?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>The most important distinction within this category is whether the
keyboard is also <em>clicky</em> - that is, gives auditory as well as tactile
feedback within microseconds of when a key makes contact.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The archetypal tactile keyboard, the IBM/Lexmark/Unicomp "Model M", is
very clicky.  Many tactile-keyboard fans swear by it and will use
nothing else - even used 30-year-old Model Ms are sought after and can
command high prices at auction. The design is still manufactured under
the Unicomp brand name. Much more on the Model M can be found at the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_M_keyboard">Model M Wikipedia
entry</a>. Usual caveats about Wikipedia apply.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Another tactile-clicky design that cast a long shadow was the
Northgate OmniKey, a line of keyboards similar to the Model M that was
produced between 1987 and 2005 by an otherwise undistinguished PC
manufacturer. After Northgate folded, these continued to be sold for a
few years (until not later than 2011) under the "Avant" brand
name. OmniKeys and Avants are now harder to find than Model Ms, but in
their day had a fanbase nearly as fervent. Examples are still in
production use in 2021, often jealously guarded by their owners.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>More modern tactile designs are usually (but not always) silent.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The tactile properties of keyboards are mainly consequences of how the
keyswitches (the active parts under the keycaps) are designed.  You
can learn the basics from reading the glossary later in this document;
a much more detailed technical explanation of keyboard and keyswitch
types is at

<h2 id="_what_are_the_drawbacks_of_tactile_keyboards">What are the drawbacks of tactile keyboards?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>The main drawback of tactile keyboards is that they have to be made
with true mechanical switches, and are significantly more expensive
than the dome- and scissor-switch designs used in most keyboards today.
They have higher manufacturing costs per unit due to increased
mechanical complexity, and because they&#8217;re a minority taste the
production runs are smaller, pushing up prices.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Not everybody instinctively learns to use the feedback tactile keyboards
provide; some people just find them pointlessly stiff and unpleasant.
Sometimes more experience will change this.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Some people find the Model M family too noisy and are better served by
tactile but non-clicky devices.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Before the "New Model M" in 2020, the Unicomp USB variant of the Model
M had not had a design refresh in a long time.  Some Unicomp USB
variants also seem to be prone to cabling problems due to insufficient
strain relief at the keyboard end.  See the
<a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/model-m-troubleshooting.html">Model M
Troubleshooting Guide</a> for details.  It&#8217;s probably best to get a New
Model M and dodge all these; indeed Unicomp&#8217;s website now deprecates
several of its own older models.</p></div>

<div class="dlist"><dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">
linear
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
        The opposite of tactile. A linear keyswitch produces
        constant resistance until it bottoms out at the end of its travel.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
clicky
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
        A clicky keyswitch produces audible feedback at
        its engagement point.  Clicky keyboards are made from
        clicky keyswitches. In older usage "clicky" implied "tactile"
        but this seems to be changing in the last few years;
        increasingly I see "clicky/silent" and "tactile/linear"
        treated as orthgogonal pairs.  To avoid ambiguity I
        suggest using "tactile-clicky" when that&#8217;s what you mean.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
silent
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
        The opposite of <em>clicky</em>. A silent keyswitch may produce some
        noise when the key bottoms out, but generates none at the
        engagement point.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
travel
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
        The trajectory of a keyswitch from the top (when a finger
        begins pressing) to the bottom when it reaches its mechanical
        limit.  Travel distance is usually between 2 and 5 mm.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
stiffness
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
        Proportional to the force required to push a keyswitch from top
        of travel to its engagement point.

<div class="dlist"><dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">
dome switch (or "rubber-dome switch")
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
        A very common, very cheap style of keyswitch consisting of a
        hollow rubber or metallized dome with contacts at the top and
        bottom that meet when the dome is compressed by finger
        pressure.  Usually manufactured in arrays in a formed rubber
        sheet.  Silent and linear, low stiffness.  Most modern
        keyboards use these.  Tactile-keyboard fans despise them.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
scissor switch
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
        Shorter-travel variant of the dome switch often found on
        low-profile keyboards such as most of Apple&#8217;s. So called
        because the keycap is connected to the dome by a plunger
        cradled by two pieces of plastic that are hinged together
        like scissors blades.  Tactile-keyboard fans often find
        these somewhat less nasty than bare dome switches.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
mechanical switch
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
        A keyswitch with a mechanical plunger assembly, springs, and
        contacts. Almost all tactile and clicky keyswitches are mechanical,
        but not vice-versa. Mechanical switches are more durable than
        dome switches, often surviving multiple decades of heavy use.
        They are also (alas) much more expensive.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
buckling-spring switch
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
        The creme de la creme of mechanical keyswitches, found only on
        the IBM Model M and close relatives such as the modern
        Unicomp. Tactile <em>and</em> clicky_ with a relatively long travel;
        too noisy and stiff for some tastes, but the unique feel
        and sound inspires near-fanatical devotion in its fans.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
Cherry switch
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
        A brand name for the most widely used line of mechanical
        keyswitch.  Several different Cherry variants are named for
        colors (with the switch casings actually in that color) and
        offer different stiffnesses and combinations of
        tactile/linear/clicky/silent behaviors.  Cherry Blues and
        Greens are tactile-clicky and generally considered the closest
        in feel to buckling-spring switches. There was an earlier
        Cherry White, now rare, that was also tactile-clicky. Cherry
        Browns, Clears, and Greys are tactile-silent.

island keys
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
        A style of keyboard in which formed keycaps protrude through
        a perforated metal or plastic plate, rather than simply abutting
        each other separated by a very small gap.  Recent Apple
        keyboards are like this.  The term "chiclet keyboard" is
        sometimes incorrectly used for these.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
membrane keyboard
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
        This is what the keypad on your microwave oven uses.  Linear,
        silent, less than a millimeter of travel, effectively zero
        stiffness.  Never found on real keyboards.  Sometimes this
        term is used for a keyboard with actual keys that uses a
        membranr-type sensor internally.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
chiclet keyboard
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
        A variant of the membrane keyboard in which the keys are
        chiclet-shaped rubber nibs bonded to the upper membrane. Even
        people who like dome-switch keyboards usually consider these
        shoddy and nasty; they&#8217;re not deployed unless lowest cost is
        absolutely imperative. In recent years this term has sometimes
        been misapplied to any low-profile keyboard with island keys.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
ergonomic keyboard
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
        Loosely used for keyboard layouts and case designs that
        try to support support a more natural, relaxed position
        of the hands and arms than allowed by the conventional
        rectangular QWERTY design.  Ergonomic keyboards may be
        split or angled in various creative ways, or arrange
        keys in arcs better fitting the hand&#8217;s range of motion.

layer
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
        A keyboard is set to have layers (or overlays) if some symbols
        that a keypress can ship require a moidifier kay.  Almost all
        keyboards have one layer addressed by the shift key.  Most
        have additional layers addressed by Ctrl, Alt and Windows (or
        Super) keys.  70% and smaller layouts have additional special
        modifiers to access nav-cluster and function keys.
