<h1>Quotes on the Right to Bear Arms</h1>
<p>
Don't think of it as `gun control', think of it as `victim
disarmament'. If we make enough laws, we can all be criminals.
</p><p>
The possession of arms by the people is the ultimate warrant
that government governs only with the consent of the governed.
</p><p align=right>        -- Jeff Snyder
</p><p>
As the Founding Fathers knew well, a government that does not trust its honest,
law-abiding, taxpaying citizens with the means of self-defense is not itself
worthy of trust. Laws disarming honest citizens proclaim that the government
is the master, not the servant, of the people.
</p><p align=right>        -- Jeff Snyder
</p><p>
Probably fewer than 2% of handguns and well under 1% of all guns will
ever be involved in a violent crime. Thus, the problem of criminal gun
violence is concentrated within a very small subset of gun owners,
indicating that gun control aimed at the general population faces a
serious needle-in-the-haystack problem.
</p><p align=right>	-- Gary Kleck, "Point Blank: Handgun Violence In America"
</p><p>
When only cops have guns, it's called a "police state".
</p><p align=right>        -- Claire Wolfe, "101 Things To Do Until The Revolution" 
</p><p>
Americans have the right and advantage of being armed - unlike the citizens
of other countries whose governments are afraid to trust the people with arms.
</p><p align=right>	-- James Madison, The Federalist Papers
</p><p>
"The best we can hope for concerning the people at large is that they be
properly armed."
</p><p align=right>        -- Alexander Hamilton, The Federalist Papers at 184-188
</p><p>
"Among the many misdeeds of British rule in India, history will look
upon the Act depriving a whole nation of arms as the blackest."
</p><p align=right>        -- Mohandas Gandhi, An Autobiography, pg 446
</p><p>
The people of the various provinces are strictly forbidden to have in their
possession any swords, short swords, bows, spears, firearms, or other types
of arms. The possession of unnecessary implements makes difficult the
collection of taxes and dues and tends to foment uprisings.
</p><p align=right>        -- Toyotomi Hideyoshi, dictator of Japan, August 1588
</p><p>
"One of the ordinary modes, by which tyrants accomplish their purposes
without resistance, is, by disarming the people, and making it an
offense to keep arms."
</p><p align=right>        -- Constitutional scholar and Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story, 1840
</p><p>
"The bearing of arms is the essential medium through which the
individual asserts both his social power and his participation in
politics as a responsible moral being..."
</p><p align=right>        -- J.G.A. Pocock, describing the beliefs of the founders of the U.S.
</p><p>
Men trained in arms from their infancy, and animated by the love of liberty,
will afford neither a cheap or easy conquest.
</p><p align=right>        -- From the Declaration of the Continental Congress, July 1775.
</p><p>
"As to the species of exercise, I advise the gun. While this gives [only]
moderate exercise to the body, it gives boldness, enterprise, and independence
to the mind.  Games played with the ball and others of that nature, are too
violent for the body and stamp no character on the mind. Let your gun,
therefore, be the constant companion to your walks."
</p><p align=right>        -- Thomas Jefferson, writing to his teenaged nephew.
</p><p>
"Taking my gun away because I might shoot someone is like cutting my tongue
out because I might yell `Fire!' in a crowded theater."
</p><p align=right>        -- Peter Venetoklis
</p><p>
...Virtually never are murderers the ordinary, law-abiding people
against whom gun bans are aimed.  Almost without exception, murderers
are extreme aberrants with lifelong histories of crime, substance
abuse, psychopathology, mental retardation and/or irrational violence
against those around them, as well as other hazardous behavior, e.g.,
automobile and gun accidents."
</p><p align=right>        -- Don B. Kates, writing on statistical patterns in gun crime
</p><p>
The right of the citizens to keep and bear arms has justly been considered as
the palladium of the liberties of a republic; since it offers a strong moral
check against usurpation and arbitrary power of rulers; and will generally,
even if these are successful in the first instance, enable the people to resist
and triumph over them."
</p><p align=right>        -- Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story of the John Marshall Court
</p><p>
Militias, when properly formed, are in fact the people themselves and
include all men capable of bearing arms. [...] To preserve liberty it is
essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms and be
taught alike, especially when young, how to use them.
</p><p align=right>        -- Senator Richard Henry Lee, 1788, on "militia" in the 2nd Amendment
</p><p>
  "...quemadmodum gladius neminem occidit, occidentis telum est."
[...a sword never kills anybody; it's a tool in the killer's hand.]
</p><p align=right>        -- (Lucius Annaeus) Seneca "the Younger" (ca. 4 BC-65 AD),
</p><p>
False is the idea of utility that sacrifices a thousand real advantages for
one imaginary or trifling inconvenience; that would take fire from men because
it burns, and water because one may drown in it; that has no remedy for evils
except destruction.  The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of
such a nature.  They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined
to commit crimes.
</p><p align=right>        -- Cesare Beccaria, as quoted by Thomas Jefferson's Commonplace book
</p><p>
No kingdom can be secured otherwise than by arming the people.  The possession
of arms is the distinction between a freeman and a slave. 
</p><p align=right>        -- "Political Disquisitions", a British republican tract of 1774-1775
</p><p>
Are we at last brought to such a humiliating and debasing degradation,
that we cannot be trusted with arms for our own defence?  Where is the
difference between having our arms in our own possession and under our
own direction, and having them under the management of Congress?  If
our defence be the *real* object of having those arms, in whose hands
can they be trusted with more propriety, or equal safety to us, as in
our own hands?
</p><p align=right>        -- Patrick Henry, speech of June 9 1788
</p><p>
"To disarm the people... was the best and most effectual way to enslave them."
</p><p align=right>        -- George Mason, speech of June 14, 1788
</p><p>
"The great object is, that every man be armed. [...] 
Every one who is able may have a gun."
</p><p align=right>        -- Patrick Henry, speech of June 14 1788
</p><p>
Such are a well regulated militia, composed of the freeholders,
citizen and husbandman, who take up arms to preserve their property,
as individuals, and their rights as freemen.
</p><p align=right>        -- "M.T. Cicero", in a newspaper letter of 1788 touching the "militia" 
            referred to in the Second Amendment to the Constitution.
</p><p>
That the said Constitution shall never be construed to authorize
Congress to infringe the just liberty of the press or the rights of
conscience; or to prevent the people of the United states who are
peaceable citizens from keeping their own arms...
</p><p align=right>        -- Samuel Adams, in "Phila. Independent Gazetteer", August 20, 1789
</p><p>
The danger (where there is any) from armed citizens, is only to the
*government*, not to *society*; and as long as they have nothing to
revenge in the government (which they cannot have while it is in their
own hands) there are many advantages in their being accustomed to the 
use of arms, and no possible disadvantage.
</p><p align=right>        -- Joel Barlow, "Advice to the Privileged Orders", 1792-93
</p><p>
[The disarming of citizens] has a double effect, it palsies the hand
and brutalizes the mind: a habitual disuse of physical forces totally
destroys the moral [force]; and men lose at once the power of
protecting themselves, and of discerning the cause of their
oppression.
</p><p align=right>        -- Joel Barlow, "Advice to the Privileged Orders", 1792-93
</p><p>
Every Communist must grasp the truth, 'Political power grows out of
the barrel of a gun.'
</p><p align=right>        -- Mao Tse-tung, 1938, inadvertently endorsing the Second Amendment.
</p><p>
In the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession 
or use of a 'shotgun having a barrel of less than eighteen inches 
in length' at this time has some reasonable relationship to the 
preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot 
say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear 
such an instrument. [...] The Militia comprised all males 
physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense.  
</p><p align=right>        -- Majority Supreme Court opinion in "U.S. vs. Miller" (1939)
</p><p>
An armed society is a polite society.  Manners are good when one 
may have to back up his acts with his life.
</p><p align=right>        -- Robert A. Heinlein, "Beyond This Horizon", 1942
</p><p>
The most foolish mistake we could possibly make would be to permit 
the conquered Eastern peoples to have arms.  History teaches that all 
conquerors who have allowed their subject races to carry arms have 
prepared their own downfall by doing so.
</p><p align=right>        -- Adolph Hitler, April 11 1942.
</p><p>
The right to buy weapons is the right to be free.
</p><p align=right>        -- A.E. Van Vogt, "The Weapon Shops Of Isher", ASF December 1942
</p><p>
Rifles, muskets, long-bows and hand-grenades are inherently democratic
weapons.  A complex weapon makes the strong stronger, while a simple
weapon -- so long as there is no answer to it -- gives claws to the
weak.
</p><p align=right>        -- George Orwell, "You and the Atom Bomb", 1945
</p><p>
Certainly one of the chief guarantees of freedom under any government,
no matter how popular and respected, is the right of the citizens to
keep and bear arms.  [...] the right of the citizens to bear arms is
just one guarantee against arbitrary government and one more safeguard
against a tyranny which now appears remote in America, but which
historically has proved to be always possible.
</p><p align=right>        -- Hubert H. Humphrey, 1960
</p><p>
No matter how one approaches the figures, one is forced to the rather
startling conclusion that the use of firearms in crime was very much
less when there were no controls of any sort and when anyone,
convicted criminal or lunatic, could buy any type of firearm without
restriction.  Half a century of strict controls on pistols has ended,
perversely, with a far greater use of this weapon in crime than ever
before.
</p><p align=right>        -- Colin Greenwood, in the study "Firearms Control", 1972
</p><p>
Let us hope our weapons are never needed --but do not forget what 
the common people knew when they demanded the Bill of Rights: An 
armed citizenry is the first defense, the best defense, and the 
final defense against tyranny.
   If guns are outlawed, only the government will have guns. Only 
the police, the secret police, the military, the hired servants of 
our rulers.  Only the government -- and a few outlaws.  I intend to 
be among the outlaws.
</p><p align=right>        -- Edward Abbey, "Abbey's Road", 1979
</p><p>
If I were to select a jack-booted group of fascists who are 
perhaps as large a danger to American society as I could pick today,
I would pick BATF [the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms].
</p><p align=right>        -- U.S. Representative John Dingell, 1980
</p><p>
.. a government and its agents are under no general duty to 
provide public services, such as police protection, to any 
particular individual citizen...
</p><p align=right>        -- Warren v. District of Columbia, 444 A.2d 1 (D.C. App.181)
</p><p>
The conclusion is thus inescapable that the history, concept, and 
wording of the second amendment to the Constitution of the United 
States, as well as its interpretation by every major commentator and 
court in the first half-century after its ratification, indicates 
that what is protected is an individual right of a private citizen 
to own and carry firearms in a peaceful manner.
</p><p align=right>         -- Report of the Subcommittee On The Constitution of the Committee On 
            The Judiciary, United States Senate, 97th Congress, second session 
            (February, 1982), SuDoc# Y4.J 89/2: Ar 5/5
</p><p>
In recent years it has been suggested that the Second Amendment
protects the "collective" right of states to maintain militias, while
it does not protect the right of "the people" to keep and bear arms.
If anyone entertained this notion in the period during which the
Constitution and the Bill of Rights were debated and ratified, it
remains one of the most closely guarded secrets of the eighteenth
century, for no known writing surviving from the period between 1787
and 1791 states such a thesis.
</p><p align=right>        -- Stephen P. Halbrook, "That Every Man Be Armed", 1984
</p><p>
To make inexpensive guns impossible to get is to say that you're
putting a money test on getting a gun.  It's racism in its worst form.
</p><p align=right>        -- Roy Innis, president of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), 1988
</p><p>
I don't like the idea that the police department seems bent on keeping
a pool of unarmed victims available for the predations of the criminal
class.
</p><p align=right>         -- David Mohler, 1989, on being denied a carry permit in NYC
</p><p>
Americans have the will to resist because you have weapons. 
If you don't have a gun, freedom of speech has no power.
</p><p align=right>         -- Yoshimi Ishikawa, Japanese author, in the LA Times 15 Oct 1992
</p><p>
You know why there's a Second Amendment?  In case the government fails to
follow the first one.
</p><p align=right>         -- Rush Limbaugh, in a moment of unaccustomed profundity 17 Aug 1993
</p><p>
The whole of the Bill [of Rights] is a declaration of the right of the
people at large or considered as individuals...  It establishes some
rights of the individual as unalienable and which consequently, no
majority has a right to deprive them of.
</p><p align=right>         -- Albert Gallatin, Oct 7 1789
</p><p>
The world is filled with violence. Because criminals carry guns, we
decent law-abiding citizens should also have guns. Otherwise they will
win and the decent people will lose.
</p><p align=right>        -- James Earl Jones
</p><p>
Whether the authorities be invaders or merely local tyrants, the
effect of such [gun control] laws is to place the individual at the 
mercy of the state, unable to resist.
</p><p align=right>        -- Robert Anson Heinlein, 1949
</p><p>
Strict gun laws are about as effective as strict drug laws...It pains
me to say this, but the NRA seems to be right: The cities and states
that have the toughest gun laws have the most murder and mayhem.
</p><p align=right>        -- Mike Royko, Chicago Tribune
</p><p>
According to the National Crime Survey administered by the Bureau of
the Census and the National Institute of Justice, it was found that
only 12 percent of those who use a gun to resist assault are injured,
as are 17 percent of those who use a gun to resist robbery. These
percentages are 27 and 25 percent, respectively, if they passively
comply with the felon's demands. Three times as many were injured if
they used other means of resistance.
</p><p align=right>        -- G. Kleck, "Policy Lessons from Recent Gun Control Research,"
		Law and Contemporary Problems 49, no. 1. (Winter 1986.): 35-62.
</p><p>
If gun laws in fact worked, the sponsors of this type of legislation
should have no difficulty drawing upon long lists of examples of
criminal acts reduced by such legislation. That they cannot do so
after a century and a half of trying -- that they must sweep under the
rug the southern attempts at gun control in the 1870-1910 period, the
northeastern attempts in the 1920-1939 period, the attempts at both
Federal and State levels in 1965-1976 -- establishes the repeated,
complete and inevitable failure of gun laws to control serious crime.
</p><p align=right>        -- Senator Orrin Hatch, in a 1982 Senate Report
</p><p>
Where rights secured by the Constitution are involved, there can be no
rule making or legislation which would abrogate them.
</p><p align=right>        -- Miranda vs. Arizona, 384 US 436 p. 491
</p><p>
Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed, as they
are in almost every kingdom in Europe. The supreme power in America
cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword, because the people are armed,
and constitute a force superior to any band of regular troops.
</p><p align=right>	-- Noah Webster
</p><p>
[President Clinton] boasts about 186,000 people denied firearms under
the Brady Law rules.  The Brady Law has been in force for three years.  In
that time, they have prosecuted seven people and put three of them in
prison.  You know, the President has entertained more felons than that at
fundraising coffees in the White House, for Pete's sake."
</p><p align=right>	-- Charlton Heston, FOX News Sunday, 18 May 1997
</p><p>
(Those) who are trying to read the Second Amendment out of the Constitution by
claiming it's not an individual right (are) courting disaster by encouraging
others to use the same means to eliminate portions of the Constitution they
don't like.
</p><p align=right>	-- Alan Dershowitz, Harvard Law School
</p><p>
The right of self-defense is the first law of nature: in most
governments it has been the study of rulers to confine this right
within the narrowest limits possible.  Wherever standing armies
are kept up, and when the right of the people to keep and bear
arms is, under any color or pretext whatsoever, prohibited,
liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the brink of
destruction." 
</p><p align=right>	-- Henry St. George Tucker (in Blackstone's Commentaries)
</p><p>
"Both oligarch and tyrant mistrust the people, 
and therefore deprive them of arms."
</p><p align=right>	--Aristotle
</p><p>
The biggest hypocrites on gun control are those who live in upscale
developments with armed security guards -- and who want to keep other
people from having guns to defend themselves.  But what about
lower-income people living in high-crime, inner city neighborhoods?
Should such people be kept unarmed and helpless, so that limousine
liberals can 'make a statement' by adding to the thousands of gun laws
already on the books?"
</p><p align=right>	--Thomas Sowell
</p><p>
"Boys who own legal firearms have much lower rates of delinquency and
drug use and are even slightly less delinquent than nonowners of guns."
</p><p align=right>	-- U.S. Department of Justice, National Institute of
	   Justice, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention,
	   NCJ-143454, "Urban Delinquency and Substance Abuse," August 1995.
</p><p>
Gun Control: The theory that a woman found dead in an alley, raped and
strangled with her panty hose, is somehow morally superior to a
woman explaining to police how her attacker got that fatal bullet wound.
</p><p align=right>	-- L. Neil Smith
</p><p>
A man with a gun is a citizen.  A man without a gun is a subject.
</p><p>
"Gun control" is a job-safety program for criminals.
</p><p>
During waves of terror attacks, Israel's national police chief will
call on all concealed-handgun permit holders to make sure they carry
firearms at all times, and Israelis have many examples where
concealed permit holders have saved lives.
</p><p align=right>	-- John R. Lott
</p><p>
"Historical examination of the right to bear arms, from English
antecedents to the drafting of the Second Amendment, bears proof that
the right to bear arms has consistently been, and should still be,
construed as an individual right."
</p><p align=right>	-- U.S. District Judge Sam Cummings, in re U.S. vs Emerson (1999).
