<h1 class="centered">Release 0: Milpitas, 20 August 1998</h1>

<p>The first Geeks with Guns outing took place the last night of
the 1998 Perl conference. It grew out of some email between Larry
Augustin and me a few months earlier. I had recruited Linus
Torvalds for a shooting expedition sometime in the indefinite
future at the 1998 Linux expo. Rob Walker (Larry's sysadmin at VAR)
and Dan Quinlan (of Transmeta and FSSTND fame) joined us.</p>

<p>Though the event was invitation-only, word of it had leaked out
before the Perl conference. Lots of people there were amused/or and
nervous about the whole deal. I enjoyed assuming a slightly manic
grin and telling people that this is all part of my master plan to
convert the hacker culture into wacko libertarian gun nuts like
me.</p>

<p>Just because I was being funny about it, they thought I was
joking. And I must have heard ``Just don't shoot Linus!'' not fewer
than two or three dozen times. Hmmph....</p>

<p>After overcoming a couple of snafus in communications and
logistics, we hauled off to the Targetmaster in Milpitas and shot
pistols for about two hours. I'd brought my Colt .45 Officer's
Model. We rented a couple of 9mm semiautos and (if I'm recalling
correctly) one .22 semiauto.</p>

<p>Our two newbies were Linus and Dan. Linus had actually had some
firearms experience during his compulsory Finnish Army service
years back, mostly rifle shooting with a few hours of pistol. Dan
was completely green.</p>

<p>I can report that Linus is a steady, competent shot -- no crack
marksman, but a careful and scientific one likely to perform well
in a clutch situation. Dan was the real surprise of the evening;
the man is a <em>natural</em>. He was astonishingly good for a
beginner, sometimes putting a couple of rounds through the same
hole at 21 feet.</p>

<p>A good time was had by all. Afterwards, we stopped at a Baker's
Square and plotted world domination over pie and coffee.</p>

<p>This original expedition was planned as a one-time event, and
only renamed ``Geeks With Guns Release 0'' retroactively when it
became clear there would be more outings.</p>
