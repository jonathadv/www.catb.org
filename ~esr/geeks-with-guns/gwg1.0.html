<h1 class="c1">Release 1.0: Atlanta, 24 October 1998</h1>

<p>The second Geeks With Guns outing took place the last night of
the 1998 Atlanta Linux Showcase. The chain of causation began with
some slightly wigged-out speculation on the linux-kernel list about
what might come down on us when Microsoft wakes up (the thread
subject was "Arm the gnus!").</p>

<p>There came a point at which I offered to teach basic defensive
pistol technique to anyone feeling <em>really</em> paranoid about
the Borg from Redmond. This had two main effects: (a) it started a
huge gun-control flamewar in which I carefully took no part, and
(b) it prompted somebody to suggest that I run my tutorial at the
soonest upcoming Linux conference, ALS.</p>

<p>I posted an announcement, and thus was ``Geeks With Guns:
Release 1'' born, announced as an ALS Birds of a Feather session.
The ALS guys (some of them gun fans themselves) swallowed hard and
didn't mess with us, except for telling us not to bring firearms
into the convention hall itself and requesting that the flyer
describe the shenanigans as ``<em>not</em> an ALS-sponsored
event''.</p>

<p>Once again, communications problems nearly screwed us over. But
we managed to meet in the Day's Inn lobby, 1900 Saturday night, and
found Georgia Range and Guns off I75 without difficulty.</p>

<p>Our cast this time included Rob Walker, Russ Nelson, Tom Turner,
Bob Macmillan, myself, and Richard M. Stallman (Richard fulfilling
our quota of at least one demigod per expedition). Richard was our
star newbie this time -- he didn't quite match Dan Quinlan's
bravura performance in Mountainview, but he was a pretty damn good
shot for a first-timer.</p>

<p>Once again it was my .45 and a couple of rented nines. I had a
strange accident early on when the barrel bushing popped out of my
gun; this cut into my shooting time because it turned out my recoil
spring cap had to be unjammed. All ended well, however.</p>

<p>Russ took pictures. Here's <a
href="everybody-but-rn.jpeg">everybody but Russ</a> on the firing
line. And here's RMS <a
href="rms-eat-lead-software-hoarders.jpeg">demonstrating his new
policy towards software hoarders</a>. (Russ's own <a
href="http://www.crynwr.com/~nelson/als98/">report</a> has more
pictures).</p>

<p>Afterwards, RMS steered us to a bar/restaurant called the Somber
Reptile to meet some friends. There indeed proved to be a bunch of
ALS people there; in fact, we basically had the place to
ourselves.</p>

<p>There was live music (with a band that turned out to include a
Linux hacker!). There were games of eight-ball, at which I was
completely incompetent (note: Russ Nelson is a pool shark!). There
was excellent Cajun food, including spicy-hot gumbo and po' boys.
There was an archetypal sexy blonde biker-chick waitress with
tattoos (she offered to show me her new ones if we come back next
year...).</p>

<p>Once again, a good time was had by all.</p>
