<h1 class="c1">Release 10.0: Los Angeles, California, 4 Dec
1999</h1>

<p>The 10.0 Geeks With Guns was a relatively quiet affair on the
evening of my 42nd birthday. I'd come to LA nearly the end of a
three-week road tour that ran through Zurich, Trondheim, Oslo,
Dublin, London, and San Francisco with barely a one-day stop at
home in Philadelphia -- with New Haven, Connecticut yet to go
before I'd come off the road.</p>

<p>I'd given two talks in LA, one at University of California and
one at Caltech. They went pretty well. I got some face time with
Michael Elkins, the author of the mutt mail client that I use.</p>

<p>My host, Clay Claiborne of Cosmos Engineering, took a small
group of us to a range called "LAX" where he'd heard rumors of a
live-fire videogame -- a video shoot-em-up that you play with real
pistols. Turned out to be real enough -- a laserdisc simulation
projected against some kind of target that can locate bullet
impacts.</p>

<p>The premise of the game is that the players are cops shooting
their way through various operations of a drug cartel. Usual
tac-shooting situations -- a heavy premium on reacting fast without
popping any no-shoots. The action was punctuated by various bits of
immemorable dialogue -- like the assault on a smugglers' airfield
that starts with a man in a Panama hat gritting out "They don't
just smuggle dope, they lose your luggage", or the city scenario
that started with a detective yelling "The Cartel is holding
hostages at the courthouse. Let's just hope they're all
lawyers!".</p>

<p>All in all, it was pretty cheesy but nevertheless enjoyable. The
rented Colt Government Model in my hand shot pretty well. It had an
extended ten-round magazine, something I'd never tried shooting
with before; fortunately it didn't seem to change the balance of
the gun seriously.</p>

<p>Afterwards, a small birthday party at Clay's, and talk of many
things with Clay and Rick Moen and Deirdre Saoirse and Mei-Ling Mak
(all three of whom had flown down from the Bay Area to join the
fun).</p>

<p>No pictures from this one, alas.</p>
