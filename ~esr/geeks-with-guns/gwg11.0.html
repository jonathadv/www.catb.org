<h1 class="c1">Release 11.0: Kansas City, 21 June 2000</h1>

<p>Another small GWG -- this one at LinuxFest 2000, a sadly
disorganized Linux trade show in Kansas City. I'd been invited to
do the opening keynote. Greg Palmer (the show organizer) actually
put this event on the show schedule for LinuxFest. This triggering
a minor flap on Slashdot by hysterical anti-gunners, which we
cheerfully ignored.</p>

<p>The tummy.com crew came in from Colorado for this event (see <a
href="gwg7.0.html">7.0</a>). Kevin Fenzi brought his WinMag, which
I duly enjoyed. But we had toys to play with that were more fun; we
had automatic weapons. The range rented us a mini-Uzi, a Heckler
&amp; Koch MP-5 (both of these shoot 9mm), and a Thompson
submachine gun (.45ACP). A master-class shooter and gunsmith named
Denny (I never got his last name) gave us a brief course in
submachine-gun technique, then we blazed away.</p>

<p>It was a very interesting experience; I'd never fired full-auto
before. Of the three weapons, the Heckler &amp; Koch was by far the
most controllable; after shooting it, I immediately understood why
it is widely popular for police and covert-ops use. The Thompson
was the most interesting to shoot. It has a strong tendency to pull
up and left, but the quality of the recoil feels kind of homey and
comforting if you're as fond of 1911-pattern pistols as I am. The
Uzi was kind of intermediate -- somewhat easier to control than the
Tommy, but not as shooter-friendly as the H&amp;K. I can also
report that an Uzi on full auto eats ammo with unbelievable
speed.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the session, I got to try the H&amp;K with a
laser sight. This is a wicked combination -- it's much easier to
hold aim on a target with the designator on, because you get
instant feedback on which way the recoil is making your sight
picture drift.</p>

<p>Denny smiled benignly on the proceedings. He was clearly
enjoying watching us enjoy ourselves -- and also, I think, enjoying
the fact that we were all experienced gun-handlers who learn
quickly and don't play stupid. It must be particularly
nerve-wracking to supervise a bunch of careless randoms playing
with Uzis...</p>

<p>I had to split after an hour and a half or so to prep for my
opening keynote. But many targets were perforated, and we all had a
good time.</p>
