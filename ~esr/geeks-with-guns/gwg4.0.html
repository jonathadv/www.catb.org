<h1 class="c1">Release 4.0: San Jose, March 5 1999</h1>

<p>Our biggest and best GWG yet went down at LinuxWorld, ``Linux's
coming-out party'' in San Jose, California. About forty of us met
at the VA Research Suite, 6:15 Thursday. We hauled off to National
Shooting Club but ended up having to relocate to the Targetmaster
in Milpitas (site of GWG 0) because the lanes at the first place
were full with an hour wait.</p>

<p>The move was accomplished with minimal fuss and a couple hours
of loud noises and general merriment ensued. I checked Don Marti
out on a rented .45; he was pretty good, but may have been
stovepiping a bit (the gun had cycling problems in his hands that I
never experienced).</p>

<p>I was also initiated into some mysteries by cypherpunk Eric
Hughes, who as it turns out is a serious shotgun aficionado. He
taught me the longarm equivalent of a quick-draw, a tricky little
move that lets you go from slung-over-shoulder to ready-to-fire
faster than one might think possible. He also demonstrated the
efficacy of shotgun tactical loads, a special low-dispersion shell
used by police. I myself was able to rip three <em>separate</em>
ragged holes out of the black zone of a B2 target at twenty feet
using these. Cool.</p>

<p>Afterwards, food and talk at Denny's. Much delving into the
mysteries of the <a href="http://www.crackmonkey.org">Crack
Monkey</a>, a bizarre dadaist website. Nick Moffitt looked pretty
rad in his mad-scientist lab coat, the like of which <em>I</em>
might at other times be seen wearing...</p>

<p>Marc Merlin took some <a
href="http://marc.merlins.org/linux/lwce_winter99/Day4/GeeksWithGuns.html">
pictures</a>. The last one is Eric Hughes (in the hat) and me
contemplating the holes made by Eric's magic tactical loads in my
target. The actual shot holes are in the black zone and hard to see
in this picture; the big ones in the white zone were made by the
filler wads in the shells.</p>
