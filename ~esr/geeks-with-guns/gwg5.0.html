<h1 class="c1">Release 5.0: Phoenix, March 21 1999</h1>

<p>So there I was in Phoenix to speak at PC Forum '99, and some
guys from the local Linux User's Group (Jiva deVoe and Ed Nusbaum)
came to get me at the airport. We proceeded to dinner and my
first-ever game of Laser Tag; I got killed a lot, but had the best
accuracy rating in our group of five. While all this was going on,
we planned my Sunday -- a run up to the Sedona red-rock country in
Ed's SUV, followed by a rendezvous with other LUGers at the Ben
Avery Range just north of my hotel.</p>

<p>The red-rock country was gorgeous -- no wonder half the Westerns
and car commercials ever filmed have made the place a bit of a
visual cliche. The pueblo ruins at Montezuma's Castle were pretty
interesting, too, but made us an hour late hitting I17 back to
Phoenix. Then we got stuck in a 5-mile backup behind somebody's
accident. The upshot is that we only got to the range a bit before
sunset, after a good many LUGers had gone home. A small and
stalwart band remained, however, and that made it the official GWG
5.</p>

<p>Ben Avery is a big, clean, well-managed outdoor range run by
friendly rangers from Arizona's Fish &amp; Game Dept. The slanting
sun over the rugged desert hills made a lovely backdrop. The
pistols available for my perusal included a Glock 21 and a
well-tuned Springfield Armory 1911A1 (thanks, Bob Eaton!). Both
nice guns in my favorite calibers, but where the Glock talked the
Springfield sang opera -- I nailed the black zone on a virgin B-2
at fifteen yards, fourteen out of fourteen shots.</p>

<p>OK, the pictures. First, <a href="dsc0311t.png">me, firing Bob's
Colt</a>. Then, one I took of Wes proudly displaying both the
``Tactical Tupperware'' Glock 21 and <a
href="dsc0319t.png">Tux</a>. Protect the right to bear penguins!
Finally, here's a picture of <a href="dsc0325t.png">most of the
gang</a> after shooting. From left: Wes Bateman, me, Bob Eaton, and
Ed Nusbaum. That's my 14-out-of-14 target I'm hugging.</p>
