<h1 class="c1">Release 7.0: Colorado Springs, 14 Aug 1999</h1>

<p>The day after the Milpitas event, I flew to Colorado to do talks
for an R&amp;D group at Hewlett-Packard and the Pike's Peak Linux
User's Group. The day after the talks, a bunch of us went shooting
at a local range called Dragonman's.</p>

<p>Dragonman's is a trip in itself. As you drive up the dirt road
from his front gate to the range and the shop, you pass a number of
wrecked cars all of which appear to have been extensively shot up
by .50-caliber machine guns. The cars are inhabited by plastic
mannequins in poses of distress and death, creating an effect
poised between macabre and comical. These tableaux are illuminated
by signs bearing legends like <a href="gwg7-5.jpg">THIS CUSTOMER
DIDN'T BUY ANYTHING</a>, <a href="gwg7-8.jpg">THIS GUY GAVE
DRAGONMAN A BAD CHECK</a>, <a href="gwg7-10.jpg">CAUGHT STEALING
FROM DRAGON MAN -- SHOT FEB 1 1992</a> and <a
href="gwg7-6.jpg">THIS WOMAN TRIED TO TAKE DRAGONMAN FOR CHILD
SUPPORT</a>. Other signs conveyed Dragonman's unique perspective on
<a href="gwg7-4.jpg">customer relations</a> and <a
href="gwg7-7.jpg">night business</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="gwg7-12.jpg">entrance</a> to Dragonman's shop
looked like a set for a movie version of Farnham's Freehold --
barbed wire and more warning signs. The dominant feature of the
interior was a <a href="gwg7-11.jpg">tasteful floor display</a> of
tripod-mounted .50-caliber machine guns, quite possibly the same
ones with which the cars outside had been shot up. The walls were
covered with automatic weapons, assault rifles, shotguns, and
sundry other destructive hardware. The overall effect was
remarkably tranquil and serene -- you <em>knew</em> there would be
no messing with <em>these</em> folks...</p>

<p>Dragonman himself is a burly biker with lots of tattoos, clear
intelligent eyes, and a sly sense of humor. We paid our range fee,
he sold us a bunch of paper targets featuring pictures of Slobodan
Milosevic and Bill Clinton (among others), and we moseyed on out to
the range.</p>

<p>The range was run by a cowboy-hatted, revolver-toting older gent
with a drawl and an earthy sense of humor straight out of a Zane
Grey novel. We quickly discovered that for all his casual air he
was damn good at his job; I learned a few techniques (like
requiring all shooters to raise their hands before taking the range
either hot or cold) that I'll use if I'm ever the range officer
myself.</p>

<p>Tim Chambers, the local organizer for my trip, had brought a
scoped .213 rifle. The rest of our guns were all pistols; a .22
semiauto, a .22 Magnum revolver, a single-action 9mm semi, and a
Glock 9mm subcompact. Then there was the fun gun of the day,
provided by Kevin Fenzi (principal author of the Linux Security
HOWTO); a .45 "Grizzly" WinMag. This thing is a monster semiauto
hand cannon that fires a special long .45 round heavier than ACP.
While not quite as rude as a .44 magnum, it is supposed to be able
to take out a charging grizzly bear (hence the name).</p>

<p>While I had some <a href="gwg7-13.jpg">fun</a> with the <a
href="gwg7-14.jpg">Grizzly</a>, for the first hour or so I didn't
hit my stride. I wasn't shooting very well and consequently was not
enjoying the proceedings as much as I might have. Not for lack of
good company though; my fellow Python fans and co-conspirators Sean
Reifschneider and Evelyn Mitchell were with us. Kevin Fenzi turned
out to be a big, cheerful, easygoing guy who looks a bit like a
Grateful Dead fan and has a lively sense of fun; I liked him on
sight. A couple of Tim's friends from HP were along too -- nice
people, but I interacted with them less and wasn't able to keep
their names straight.</p>

<p>Here's a picture of about <a href="gwg7-1.jpg">half the gang</a>
at our bench on the 50-foot range. One of the guys from HP is
standing behind the fence. That's Kevin Fenzi with the red hair and
me next to him in the black User Friendly gimme-cap (placed in my
hands by Illiad himself two days before). Tim Chambers is wearing
the sunglasses. And <a href="gwg7-2.jpg">here</a> is Kevin shooting
the Grizzly, Sean with the .22 semiauto, and me with the spotting
scope.</p>

<p>Things started to pick up when I noticed that the two guys over
at the next bench were firing some kind of extremely wicked-looking
automatic weapon (in single-shot mode, alas). Now, one of the
things I like about gun folks is that they tend to respond well to
polite curiosity. If you're respectful and look responsible and
don't act like you presume a right to mess with their weapons and
their business, they'll often be very open and willing to share not
just knowledge but a bit of ammo, too. So I wandered over and
looked interested.</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter I found myself shooting single rounds from a
genuine, Israeli-made <a href="gwg7-17.jpg">Uzi submachine gun</a>.
Pretty interesting, though I found it's harder for me to maintain
accuracy with the peep sight on those things than it is with the
conventional notch sight on a pistol. So that was my first
educational experience of the day.</p>

<p>My second educational experience of the day, and even more fun
to boot, was when I discovered bowling pins. I hadn't been doing
too well with the paper targets at 50 feet; I had persistent
trouble setting up a clean sight picture, I think because the
features on the targets just weren't very distinct to my
less-than-perfect vision. But then we set up a row of bowling pins.
Finally something I could focus on! I had heard of bowling-pin
shooting, but never tried it.</p>

<p>I hefted Kevin's Grizzly, <a href="gwg7-3.jpg">took stance</a>
-- and downed six pins in nine shots, the first three without a
miss. There was a general murmur of admiration, and even the
rangemaster allowed as how that was pretty good. I had found my
groove. Of course, I then got too attached to my performance
despite my best efforts to be Zen about the whole thing, and my
accuracy dropped embarrassingly until I managed to calm down a
bit.</p>

<p>Suddenly everybody was interested in bowling pins. During the
next cold interval, we scrounged a good thirty of them from various
resting places all over the pistol range and set up a serried rank
in front of the timber baulk at the 50-foot line. When the range
went hot again, everybody happily blazed away. At one point I
inadvertently double-tapped -- and knocked over two pins! My
confession that I hadn't really intended that second shot was
greeted with hoots of good-natured derision and ``Suuuure you
didn't''.</p>

<p>Amidst general merriment, we reset the pins, took a <a
href="gwg7-15.jpg">`before' photo</a>, blew them all down in a hail
of pistol fire, and took an <a href="gwg7-16.jpg">`after'
photo.</a> The guys at the next bench with the Uzi were grinning.
The rangemaster was eying the Grizzly joking about not recalling
authorizing any cannons. It was a good day.</p>

<p>We packed up about 1530 and, after some caucusing, repaired to a
local Outback Steakhouse for an early dinner. Later we relocated to
a local bar/lounge for drinks and conversation well into the
evening. Another successful Geeks With Guns for the record.</p>
