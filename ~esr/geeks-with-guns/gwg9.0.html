<h1 class="c1">Release 9.0: Phoenix, Arizona, 17 Oct 1999</h1>

<p>And it was back to the 5.0 venue, Ben Avery shooting range, on
yet another day of perfect Arizona weather. Again about eight
people, but a lot more weapons than Atlanta -- my personal
short-barrel .45, at least one other .45, three .40s, several 9mm
guns, a .22 target pistol, a single-action cowboy-action-shooting
revolver, a black-powder muzzle loader, a couple of scoped hunting
rifles, an AR-16, and an HK M91 bipod gun.</p>

<p>The HK, set up with sniper sights, was an interesting
experience. I generally don't like ring-and-post sights, but these
were pretty good. I actually made consistent hits on a target a
couple hundred yards downrange, three-quarters of the way back to
the berm. The .22 and the AR-16, on the other hand, were not good
to me; the .22 started misfeeding after just a few shots, and the
AR-16 wouldn't fire at all (some kind of lock-up; the owner
concluded lugubriously that it needs a lube job).</p>

<p>The real fun started when the two spinner targets came out.
These things have a inverted-U-shaped support that you hammer into
the ground; this was easy in the loose, sandy desert soil. The
middle, uppermost part of the U threads through a collar with two
paddle-shaped wings. One wing is bigger than the other so that at
rest the spinner is vertical. But if you hit either paddle with a
bullet, the collar will merrily and quite visibly spin around.</p>

<p>We set two of these up at the manufacturer's minimum recommended
distance of 25 yards (ricochets off a metal target are no fun to
have in your face). At that distance, the orange sticker on the
three-inch-wide upper panel is a <em>difficult</em> target for a
pistol.</p>

<p>I couldn't hit it with the .22 at all before that rather elderly
gun packed up on us. But my trusty .45 proved a different matter. I
spent the last four shooting rounds trying to learn how to nail the
spinner reliably. This was initially frustrating but big fun; I
started out making about one in six shots, and pulled my hit rate
up to one in four. One clip I was really in the groove and made
three shots out of seven.</p>

<p>I was working on pulling my hit rate up to one in three when one
of my shots knocked the spinner support clean out of the ground. Ah
well...</p>

<p>The day had one more pleasant surprise waiting. The sun was
setting and the range about to close down when Mike Shelton loaded
up his black-powder muzzle-loader revolver. We got one shot each.
The gun discharged huge showers of gaudy sparks in the gathering
dusk.</p>

<p>The day was a great success. We packed up and proceeded to a
local Mexican place for dinner.</p>
