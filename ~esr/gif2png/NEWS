  Release packaging using automake/autoconf

This program was written by a German university student named Alexander
Lehmann <alex@hal.rhein-main.de> in 1995. He evolved it to a beta
version 0.6 and then dropped off the face of the net.  In Fall 1999,
after the program had been stable and in production use for four years, 
Greg Roelofs <newt@pobox.com> added some minor features and released 0.7.

A short time later, with Greg's consent, I took over maintaining
gif2png in order to give it a proper manual page and release
packaging. Alexander Lehmann is OK with this and has even approved
a change in the license terms to use the libpng/zlib license.

This code was totally stable between 2004 and 2009, so it lay dormant
in a bunch of RCS files for six years before being converted to a more
modern VCS.  If you really care about the release dates for all the
ancient versions, you can deduce them by mining the tagged versions.
