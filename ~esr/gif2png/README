		gif2png -- GIF to PNG graphics file conversion

The gif2png program converts files from the Graphic Interchange Format
to Portable Network Graphics.  It can be built under any operating
system conforming to POSIX.1-2001 and Go; this includes all modern
Unixes.

This distribution also supplies web2png, a Python front end for
gif2png which automagically converts entire web hierarchies (the
graphics files themselves and references to them in web pages).

Installation instructions are in the file INSTALL.

You can test the correctness of this code with the regression-test
suite in the directory test/; this can be done with 'make check' from
the toplevel directory.

Some options supported in older (pre-3.0.0) versions of this tool were
dropped when the code was ported to Go.  If you have a compatibility
requirement for one of these, please file an issue on the project
tracker.

See the file 'control' for repository and hosting information.
