			README for git-weave

git-weave takes a tarball sequence and a metadata file and synthesizes
a live repository. It can invert this, explode git repositories into
sequences of per-commit tarballs. The DAG is expressed as a metadata file
with mailbox-like entries.

An important application is for making a repository out of ancient
fossil tarballs by synthesizing a metadata file.

Requires git, find, and cpio.

To test the software, run 'make check'
