<h1>OVERVIEW</h1>

<p>As early as 1976 it was estimated that more had been written on
the subject of "gun control" than on all other crime-related topics
combined.{2} Yet this pre-1976 academic literature was both
fundamentally flawed and severely biased. The bias stemmed from the
crusading zeal of academics who, by their own admission, could "see
no reason ... why anyone should own a weapon in a democracy"{3} and
felt gun owners embodied an American soul that is "hard, isolate,
stoic and a killer".{4} Naturally this bias led the academic
crusaders to discuss gun ownership as a social pathology rather
than as a value-neutral sociological phenomenon. The only
admissible study topics were problematic ones: gun accidents, gun
violence, gun ownership among extremist groups.{5} Implicitly these
problems were seen as fairly representing the 50% of American
households that contain guns; nor did it occur to the crusaders
that gun ownership might present issues worthy of neutral or
non-problematic study.{6}</p>

<p>Thus, until about the mid-1970s academic writing about guns was
virtually monopolized by crusaders seeking to validate their
contempt and loathing for guns and gun owners. Neutral scholars
eschewed the gun issue, and the gun lobby, though able to exert
great pressure on legislators, was incapable of, and uninterested
in, addressing intellectually sophisticated audiences.{7} However
unavoidable, this intellectual default was a calamity for the gun
owners. They may hold their views without feeling any need for
factual or scholarly support; but the biased, problem-oriented pre-
1976 literature indelibly shaped the views of many humane and
responsible ordinary citizens who did not own guns.</p>

<p>Yet that literature has not proved persuasive to neutral
scholars. Writing in 1976, policy analyst Bruce-Briggs noted with
astonishment that, despite the literature's enormity, "no policy
research worthy of the name has been done on the issue of gun
control. The few attempts at serious work are of marginal
competence and tainted by obvious bias."{8} Likewise a sociologist
has used early problematic literature on guns as a case study of
Znaniecki's concept of "sagecraft" -- the prostitution of
scholarship by partisan academic "sages" who invent, select or
misinterpret data to validate preordained conclusions.{9}</p>

<h2>1. Sagecraft Summarized</h2>

<p>Lest the sagecraft concept seem unduly harsh I briefly review
five particularly insupportable anti-gun claims (they and others
are further detailed in the body of this paper):</p>

<p>a) the claim that homicide is predominantly a matter of
"ordinary law-abiding people" killing a relative or acquaintance
because a loaded gun happened to be available in a moment of anger
--</p>

<p>This claim is contradicted by every national and local study of
homicide. These studies uniformly show that murderers are not
"ordinary law-abiding people." Rather, they (like gun accident
perpetrators) are highly aberrant individuals, characterized by
felony records, alcohol and/or drug dependence and life histories
of irrational violence against those around them.{10}</p>

<p>b) the claim that (though banning all guns may not be
politically feasible) banning handguns only would save lives
because gun attacks are more lethal than knife attacks --</p>

<p>In a recent National Institute of Justice survey among about
2,000 incarcerated felons, well over 80% of those who had often
misused handguns said that if handguns were unavailable they would
turn to long guns (rifles or shotguns) instead.{11} Thus, a crucial
issue in any handgun ban is that, while handgun wounds are 1.3 to 3
times more lethal than knife wounds, a rifle or shotgun wound kills
5-11.4 times more often than a handgun wound. Far from decreasing
homicide, if a handgun ban caused only 30% of handgun attackers to
turn to long guns, the homicide rate might nearly double; if 50%
switched it could more than triple.{12} Astoundingly, not one
academic who argued that banning handguns would save lives (because
knives are less deadly) even mentioned the necessary corollary of
that theory as to the far greater lethality of rifles and
shotguns.</p>

<p>c) the claim that comparison of American statistics to those of
selected gun-banning foreign countries proves that guns cause crime
and banning them reduces it --</p>

<p>Differentials in international crime rates reflect basic
socio-cultural and economic differences that have nothing to do
with gun laws. After all: 1) Western Europe has not just far less
gun violence but less violence of all kinds per capita; 2) This
difference between the U.S. and Western Europe was even greater
before the latter's gun laws were adopted in the 1920s and 1930s;
3) Those laws were adopted to control political violence -- to
which those countries have always been far more subject than the
U.S.; 4) As American violence skyrocketted from the mid-1960s on,
violence rates increased even more rapidly in the gun banning
countries (particularly gun violence); 5) In such equally crime-
free countries as Switzerland, Israel and New Zealand there is even
more gun availability than there is in the U.S.{13}</p>

<p>d) The claim that guns are generally not useful and not used for
self-defense --</p>

<p>The definitive study finds that, while handguns are used in vast
numbers of crimes annually, they are even more often used by good
citizens to repel crime (c. 581,000 crimes vs. c. 645,000 defense
uses, annually).{14}</p>

<p>e) the claim that there is no individual right to arms because
the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution protects
only the states' right to arm the militia --</p>

<p>Though mere control is constitutional, wholesale prohibition and
confiscation is not; the Constitution precludes laws barring
responsible, law-abiding adults from choosing to own guns for self-
defense. A leading constitutional scholar (who personally opposes
gun ownership) recently dismissed academic obliviousness to this
clear fact in a paper fittingly entitled "The Embarrassing Second
Amendment".{15}</p>

<h2>2. The National Institute of Justice Evaluation</h2>

<p>My condemnation of anti-gun sagecraft should not at all be
misconstrued as an endorsement of such equally baseless pro-gun
shibboleths as the obnoxious, reflexive assumption that any form of
control the gun lobby opposes ipso facto violates the Second
Amendment. But gun lobby nonsense does not justify academic anti-
gun crusaders in departing from ordinary canons of scholarship to
indulge their personal antipathy to guns and their owners.</p>

<p>In 1978 the National Institute of Justice funded a review of the
whole corpus of then-extant social scientific literature on gun
control (hereinafter called the NIJ Evaluation). Done at the
University of Massachusetts, this encyclopedic analysis provides
the benchmark and point of departure for all later research in the
field. Its senior authors began with the expectation that it would
confirm the anti-gun views they admittedly shared. Instead it
provides an almost unrelieved condemnation of the one-sided
problem-oriented literature of the 1960s and early 1970s.{16}</p>

<p>My purpose in this paper is to summarize the current data on all
major aspects of the gun controversy. I shall supplement and update
the NIJ Evaluation in light of numerous credible studies that have
appeared since the mid-1970s. Predictably, this data has emerged
from analyses approaching gun ownership as a social phenomenon to
be studied rather than as a problem to be exorcised by polemics
thinly disguised as academic discourse.</p>

<h2>3. Realistic gun control advocacy</h2>

<p>Rejection of specious or unproven anti-gun views does not entail
accepting equally specious or unproven pro-gun propaganda. By the
same token, realistically acknowledging that gun laws cannot
overcome basic socio-economic and cultural causes of violence does
not at all justify the gun lobby's myopic rejection of the very
concept of control. Rather, recognizing the inherent limitations of
control means freeing it from unrealistic expectations of what it
can actually accomplish. Such realism precludes only counter-
productively utopian legislation: gun laws whose potential
enforcement and other costs are likely to exceed their probable
benefits. By rejecting such laws we deprive the gun lobby of a
major propaganda device: crowing over the failure of gun control to
accomplish the miracles its incautious advocates so rashly promise.
One of the most the scrupulous and sophisticated of academic gun
control advocates puts the issues in perspective:</p>

<dl>
<dd>...handgun control advocates have often given a greatly
exaggerated picture of what might be accomplished through gun
control. Feasible control programs might be capable of reducing the
overall amount of violent crime by a few percentage points, and, if
so, these programs may be worthwhile. But handgun control by itself
will not make the streets safe.</dd>

<dd>... the "ideal" gun control program [is] one that does not pose
serious barriers to the possession of handguns for legitimate
purposes, but does effectively inhibit the use of handguns in crime
by a method which has low cost to the criminal justice system and
to the society at large.{17}</dd>
</dl>

<p>In this connection it is crucial to disavow a myth that has been
perpetrated by both pro- and anti-gun extremists: that what
"control" really means is reducing -- eventually banning -- guns to
all but the military and the police. Of course the myth is true
insofar as its represents the goal of anti-gun crusaders who deny
that gun owners have any legitimate interests.{18} But that is not
what "control" means, either literally or to the majority of
Americans who support it (a majority that includes, surveys show,
most gun owners). The literal meaning of "control" is regulation,
not prohibition. Likewise, what "control" means to most Americans
is reasonable compromise to accommodate both the legitimate
interests of responsible gun owners and the clear social need for
rational control over a deadly instrumentality.{19} Regrettably,
the trust that is essential for compromise and accommodation has
been destroyed by the rancorous vituperation that has characterized
the debate over gun control.</p>

<h2>4. Respectable bigotry.</h2>

<p>We are so inured to the vituperative terms in which the gun
debate is carried on that it may be useful to consider the issue in
a wholly different context. Recently a psychiatrist publicized the
terrifying story of her repeated vain attempts to control, or have
incarcerated, a malicious bi-sexual patient who continues to have
promiscuous, unsafe sex with people who don't know that he has the
AIDS virus.{20} Doubtless other examples could be cited of people
who spread AIDS irresponsibly or even deliberately. But
enlightened, liberal people would not jump from the few such
examples to vilifying bi-sexuals or gays or gay rights activists,
in general. Enlightened, liberal people rightly see it as bigotry
to blame the wrong-doing of an irresponsible, aberrant few on a
whole group of innocent, responsible people.</p>

<p>Returning to gun control, studies trying to link gun ownership
to violence rates find either no relationship or a negative, i.e.,
cities and counties with high gun ownership suffer less violence
than demographically comparable areas with lower gun ownership.{21}
Summarizing these and other studies, a recent National Institute of
Justice analysis finds: It is clear that only a very small fraction
of privately owned firearms are ever involved in crime or
[unlawful] violence, the vast bulk of them being owned and used
more or less exclusively for sport and recreational purposes, or
for self-protection.{22} Concommitantly, it has been estimated that
98.32% of owners do not use a gun in an unlawful homicide (over a
50 year adult life span).{23}</p>

<p>In sum, murderers comprise only a small, highly aberrant (and
malignant and irresponsible) subset of all gun owners. Why, then,
is it enlightened and liberal: to vilify the 50% of American
householders who have guns as barbaric and/or deranged ("Gun
Lunatics Silence [the] Sounds of Civilization"{24}), "gun nuts",
"gun fetishists", "anti-citizens" and "traitors, enemies of their
own patriae"{25}, as sexually warped{26} "bulletbrains"{27} who
engage in "simply beastly behavior"{28} and represent "the worst
instincts in the human character"{29}; or to traduce pro-gun groups
as the "pusher's best friend"{30} and their entire membership as
"psychotics", "hunters who drink beer, don't vote and lie to their
wives about where they were all weekend"{31}; to characterize the
murder of children as "another slaughter co-sponsored by the
National Rifle Association"{32} and assert that "The assassination
of John Lennon has been brought to you by the National Rifle
Association"{33}; and to cartoon gun owners as thugs and/or
vigilantes, intellectually retarded, educationally backward and
morally obtuse, or as Klansmen?{34}</p>

<p>The NIJ Evaluation accurately describes how the anti-gun
advocates sees gun owners: as "demented and blood-thirsty
psychopaths whose concept of fun is to rain death upon innocent
creatures both human and otherwise." It is really quite remarkable
for such calumnies to issue from people who, rightly, regard it as
egregious bigotry when other bigots: seek to blame AIDS deaths on
gays whom they revile as sexually warped, moral degenerates who
engage in simply bestial behavior; or blame gay rights activists
for AIDS because they lobby against ordinances that would close
bath houses; describe abortion rights activists as murderers, "baby
butchers" and abortion clinics as "merchants of death"; dismiss all
homeless people and welfare recipients as slackers, drug addicted,
alcoholic or retarded; or traduce the ACLU as the "best friend" of
criminals and drug pushers.</p>

<p>The fact that anti-gun crusaders are commendably eager to oppose
racism, gay bashing and other evils they recognize as bigotry does
not excuse their inability to recognize their own bigotry. On the
contrary, it compounds that bigotry with myopia, if not
hypocrisy.</p>

<h2>5. The Political Cost of Bigotry.</h2>

<p>As important as the issue of bigotry is that this incessant
vilification of gun owners precludes reasonable compromise over gun
laws. The gun lobby press faithfully reports the philippics, and
reprints the most vituperative anti-gun cartoons, to inflame its
readers.{35} Why would the gun lobby actually pay royalties to
Herblock, Oliphant etc. for their anti-gun cartoons? Because the
gun lobby's purposes are best served by convincing gun owners they
are a hated minority. There can be no greater incentive for
monetary contributions to the gun lobby and fanatic hatred of gun
law proposals, no matter how apparently reasonable.</p>

<p>Gun owners are convinced (in part, by bitter experience) that
gun laws will be invidiously administered and unfairly enforced;
and, just as important, that gun owners are anathema to persons and
groups like the ACLU to whom other American can look for help
against mistreatment at the hands of the state.{36} So gun owners
hysterically oppose controls substantially similar to ones they
readily accept for cars and prescription medicines. This is only
natural, given the rancor with which controls are advocated and the
purposes avowed by their more extreme advocates. Would driver
licensing and automobile registration have been adopted if they had
been advocated on the basis that having a car is evidence of moral,
intellectual or sexual incapacity -- or that the desired end is to
progressively increase regulation until cars are unavailable to all
but the military and the police? Would not diabetics and others
with chronic illness hysterically oppose the prescription system if
doctors were under constant pressure from church groups and
editorialists denouncing medication as immoral? Do not gay rights
activists vehemently oppose policies (however apparently
reasonable), they see as motivated by enmity to gays and likely to
be administered in that spirit of enmity?</p>

<p>Two clarifications are in order here: 1) I recognize that cars,
guns and medicines are different commodities that may require very
different policy responses. My point is only that no policy,
however rational in the abstract, can succeed if those it regulates
see it as motivated by hatred, contempt and denial that they have
any legitimate interests to be considered. 2) I also recognize that
gun owners respond to anti-gun attacks no less hatefully. But there
is a crucial difference: gun owners are not seeking to make their
enemies own guns. In contrast, what control advocates do by heaping
contempt on gun owners is forever alienate those whose compliance
is indispensable if gun laws are to work. However satisfying it may
be to anti-gun crusaders to portray gun owners as "demented and
blood-thirsty psychopaths whose concept of fun is to rain death
upon innocent creatures both human and otherwise", the result is
catastrophically counter-productive to the cause of gun
control.</p>

<h2>6. Realistic control vs. symbolic gun prohibition</h2>

<p>Stanford Law Professor John Kaplan (until his death, the leading
American authority on narcotics policy) used to remark on anti-gun
crusaders' profound ignorance of guns as technological objects and
of gun owners and of why and how guns are owned and used. An apt
simile would be to narcotics regulations proposed by people so
ignorant of the subject that they thought cocaine a common
vegetable and marijuana a gas. This ignorance leads anti-gun
crusaders to formulate proposals that, if effective, would double
or even triple the death tolls from gun accidents and
assaults.{37}</p>

<p>This comprehensive ignorance is part and parcel of the anti- gun
crusaders' loathing and contempt for gun owners. Anti-gun crusaders
often express their pride in knowing nothing about guns because it
sets them apart from the barbaric gun lover. Nor do they care that
this ignorance precludes their evaluating the viability and
pragmatic value of potential control strategies. That is not a
great problem for anti-gun crusaders because, ultimately, they are
more interested in the symbolic significance of having guns banned
than in establishing pragmatic and effective control over them.</p>

<p>Unlike the great majority of Americans (even a majority of gun
owners) who seek controls for pragmatic purposes like saving lives,
the anti-gun crusader's goal is with the symbolic function of a ban
as an official endorsement of his views and moral superiority and
as a concommitant condemnation of guns and their owners.{38} That
their concern is symbolism rather than pragmatic value is proven by
an astonishing fact: it happens that many who are anti-gun are, at
the same time, strongly oppose pornograpy, narcotics, and other
blue laws on the grounds, primarily, that they are unenforceable;
yet the enormous literature they have produced advocating gun bans
contains not a single attempt to show how a ban would be
enforceable.{39} Though acutely aware of the issue of enforcibility
in other contexts, anti-gun crusaders have not even tried to show
that a gun ban would stop the millions of people who think they
have both a constitutional right and an urgent need to a handgun
for family protection from keeping or getting one. The anti-gun
crusader ignores enforcibility for, at bottom, his opposition to
gun ownership is not pragmatic, but symbolic. It parallels the
"sophisticated" argument for banning suicide, homosexuality or
pornography -- even if it is not enforceable, the ban symbollizes
society's condemnation of this morally abhorrent excresence.</p>

<h1>PEJORATIVE CHARACTERIZATIONS OF GUN OWNERSHIP</h1>

<h2>1. The Penis Theory--{40}</h2>

<p>Reviewing unsubstantiated, mostly "derogatory... speculative
literature on the personality characteristics of gun owners", the
NIJ Evaluation (p. 120) mentions "the psychoanalytic" view that
"weapons are phallic symbols representing male dominance and
masculine power." The idea of gun ownership as sexual aberration
has been casually espoused by such anti-gun luminaries as Arthur
Schlessinger, Jr., Harlan Ellison, Mike Royko and Joyce
Brothers.{41} The only serious study endorsing this view is by
psychiatrist Emmanuel Tanay who sees "the need for a gun" as
serving "libidinal purposes ... to enhance or repair a damaged
self-image...", and involving "narcissism..., [p]assivity and
insecurity".{42}</p>

<p>There is no viable argument for the penis theory as against
pragmatic explanations for gun ownership. Psychiatrist Bruce Danto
rejects the penis theory because it fails to account for female gun
ownership. In fact, 50% of those who own a gun for protection only
are women (especially black women), even though women are much less
likely than men to own guns for sport.{43} To say the very least,
this pattern is more easily explicable by reference to women's felt
need for protection than by feelings of penile inadequacy.</p>

<p>Dr. Danto also notes that the penis theory would predict that
male gun owners would be inclined toward the largest barrel and
bore weapons available. But the respective popularity of guns of
different sizes uniformly appears to reflect purely pragmatic
concerns.{44} The penis theory is equally incapable of explaining
other demographic differentials in gun ownership. When all gun
owners are counted (not just those who own for protection alone)
survey evidence shows that</p>

<dl>
<dd>gun owners are disproportionately rural, Southern, male,
Protestant, affluent and middle class... [and that] weapons
ownership tends to increase with income, or occupational prestige,
or both.{45}</dd>
</dl>

The explanations here are, once again, purely pragmatic; hunting is
more an activity of rural people generally, and Southerners
particularly, than of city dwellers; among urbanites, guns are most
owned by the affluent because they are more likely to hunt -- and
also to have the money to afford guns and property that they may
feel the need to defend; most guns are owned for sport and males
engage in gun sports more than females. As to Protestants, survey
evidence shows them more likely to hunt than Catholics or Jews
(Protestantism is most predominant in rural areas); and, beyond
that, Protestants and gun owners both tend to be descended from
older American stock, retaining cultural values redolent of the
"individualistic orientation that emanated from the American
frontier...."{46} 

<p>In contrast, the penis theory has no explanatory value for these
demographic trends. Are Protestants or the affluent or rural
dwellers or Southerners more subject to feelings of penile
inadequacy than Catholics or urbanites or the poor etc., etc.? In
this connection it may be relevant to note that surveys show gun
owners are no more hostile to feminism and the women's movement
than are non-owners.{47}</p>

<p>Tanay's arguments for the penis theory validate only his own
(self-admitted) fear and loathing of guns. He asserts that "The
owner's overvaluation of his gun's worth is an indication of its
libidinal value to him." Because Tanay never attempts to explain
what "overvaluation" means, there is nothing to distinguish guns
from the "overvaluation" involved in having other collectibles.
People who do not share the passion marvel at the amounts of time
and money that others who "over-value" them expend on such more or
less intrinsically worthless items as old phonograph records,
musical instruments, cars, political campaign buttons, stamps,
coins and candelabra.{48} Much the same problem inheres in Tanay's
evidence of "narcissistic investment":</p>

<dl>
<dd>Most of the dedicated gun owners handle the gun with obvious
pleasure; they look after the gun, clean, polish and pamper it...
speak of their love and respect for guns.</dd>
</dl>

So, of course, do most, if not all, collectors revere the objects
they collect, cleaning and polishing them (if coins or antiques),
encasing them (if coins or musical instruments) in velvet, suede or
other attractive settings, etc. Are all collectors motivated by
feelings of penile inadequacy? Or does Dr. Tanay's depiction of gun
owners reflect only his own narrow-minded inability to evaluate the
feelings of those who love and respect something he admittedly
loathes? 

<p>A final point of interest is Dr. Tanay's citation of Freud's
view that weapons may symbolize the penis in dreams. This, Freud
says, is true of dreams involving any long object (e.g. "sticks,
umbrellas, poles, trees") but especially of objects that may be
viewed as penetrating, and injuring ("knives, daggers, lances,
sabers; firearms are similarly used...."). This passage refers to
dreams in general without distinguishing gun owners from others.
Dr. Tanay is perhaps unaware of -- in any event he does not cite --
other passages more relevant to his argument. In these other
passages Freud associates retarded sexual/emotional development not
with gun ownership, but with fear and loathing of weapons.{49} The
probative importance that ought to attach to the views of Freud is,
of course, a matter of opinion. The point here is only that those
views provide no support for the penis theory of gun ownership.</p>

<h2>2. Gun ownership as a cause of aggression --</h2>

<p>Obviously some gun owners are highly aggressive, indeed violent,
else the U.S. would not suffer hundreds of thousands of gun crimes
each year. The question is: are gun criminals properly considered
representative of all gun owners, or are they a tiny aberrant
minority best understood in the context of the larger aberrant
minority of criminals who, with and without guns, commit millions
of violent crimes in the U.S. each year? Based on the recent NIJ
felon survey it appears that criminals who used guns in their
crimes either sporadically or regularly are among the "hardest" of
offenders. Per capita they had committed not only a larger number
of violent crimes (often while armed with knives or weapons other
than guns) than other offenders, but more crimes of all
kinds.{50}</p>

<p>Nevertheless the anti-gun "sagecraft" literature portrayed gun
crime as more or less a necessary effect of gun ownership. In a
series of articles Prof. Leonard Berkowitz asserted that guns
arouse hostile and aggressive impulses in their owners. To prove
this he conducted laboratory tests supposedly showing subjects'
hostility levels rose particularly when others who annoyed them
were associated with guns in various ways.{51} Evidence of this
"weapons effect" is limited and erratic. Other psychologists have
been unable to replicate Berkowitz's results; indeed, some found
subjects less willing to express hostility against persons whom
they associated with weapons.{52}</p>

<p>More important is that, no matter what the results, the design
of these experiments precluded Berkowitz's conclusion that a weapon
increases its owners' hostility and aggressiveness. For none of his
experiments involved a weapon being possessed by the subject, i.e.,
the person whose hostility was being tested. In Berkowitz's tests
the weapon was associated only with the person against whom
hostility would run. Thus Berkowitz was testing not gun owner
hostility but hostility against persons his college student
subjects associated with guns.{53} Buss, Brooker &amp; Buss did
test the hostility level of both owners and non-owners after
actually firing guns, but could find "no evidence that the
presence, firing or long-term use of guns enhances subsequent
aggression."{54}</p>

<h2>3. Violent personality or attitude characteristics of gun
owners</h2>

<p>Another attempt to demonstrate the iniquity of gun owners
concluded that they are "violence prone" -- based on survey data in
which what the subjects actually approved was not illegal violence
but the use of force necessary to stop crime or aid its
victims.{55} A more recent study offers a more neutral assessment
based on three national surveys: gun owners differ from non-owners
only in being more likely to approve "defensive" force, i.e. force
directed against violent attackers. In contrast, those exhibiting
"violent attitudes" (as defined by approval of violence against
social deviants or dissenters) are no more likely to be gun owners
than non-owners. Interestingly, the holders of violent attitudes
were less likely than the average gun owner to approve of defensive
force (perhaps perceiving it would be directed against violent
people like themselves).{56}</p>

<p>In addition to such directly relevant studies, there exists a
substantial quantity of macrocosmic evidence against both the
Berkowitz hypothesis that guns promote violent impulses and the
alternative anti-gun hypothesis that gun ownership signifies a
violent personality. If either hypothesis were true, it should
follow that increased gun ownership would be highly correlative
with violent crime, i.e. the more guns the more violence. Yet the
consistent result of studies attempting to link gun ownership to
violence rates is either no relationship or a negative one, i.e.
that urban and other areas with higher gun ownership have less
violence than demographically comparable areas with lower gun
ownership.{57}</p>

<h2>4. Paranoia, sexism and racism --</h2>

<p>Anti-gun crusaders have traditionally derided gun ownership as a
product of exaggerated, unrealistic public fears of crime.{58}
Extreme, unrealistic fear of crimes may amount to mental illness
and anti-gun crusaders do epithetically dismiss gun owners as
paranoid and gun ownership as a "national paranoia".{59} Moreover,
precautionary handgun ownership is commonly held to signify and
promote irrational fears, intolerance and belligerence: "The mere
possession of a gun is, in itself, an urge to kill, not only by
design, but by accident, by madness, by fright, by
bravado."{60}</p>

<p>Yet gun owners do not seem to be more fearful of crime than
other members of the general public. Rather, polls and attitude
studies suggest that gun owners may actually be less afraid than
non-owners.{61} This lesser fear may be explained by findings of a
study of "Good Samaritans" who had arrested criminals or rescued
their victims. In contrast to the less than 33% of Americans who
then owned any kind of gun, almost two-and-one-half as many of the
Samaritans (81%) "own guns and some carry them in their cars. They
are familiar with violence, feel competent to handle it, and don't
believe they will be hurt if they get involved."{62}</p>

<p>So the charge of paranoia against gun owners seems not to be
substantiated. What about the charges of intolerance, bigotry and
belligerence? As to sexism, I have already noted that analysis of
two national surveys shows gun owners no more hostile to feminism
and the women's movement than are non-owners.{63} As to racism, the
result of one local attitude study can be deemed to suggest that
gun owners are likely to hold racist views.{64} But the asserted
correlation between gun ownership and racism is not borne out by
the several state and national studies of gun owner attitudes that
have included questions designed to elicit racist views.{65}
Analysis of another national poll reveals that, while liberals were
less likely to own guns than the general populace, those liberals
who own a gun were no less willing than other gun owners to use it
if necessary to repel a burglar.{66}</p>

<dl>
<dd>The NIJ Evaluation pithily summarizes the contrast between
partisan sagecraft and actual social science: ... even in much of
the scholarly literature[,] the "typical" private weapons owner is
often depicted as a virtual psychopath -- unstable, violent,
dangerous. The empirical research [we have] reviewed leads to a
sharply different portrait... There is no evidence suggesting [gun
owners] to be an especially unstable or violent or maladapted lot;
their "personality profiles" are largely indistinct from those of
the rest of the population. [p. 122]</dd>

<h1>DEFENSIVE GUN OWNERSHIP VS. CRIME</h1>

<p>The impossibility of the police preventing endemic crime, or
protecting every victim, has become all too tragically evident over
the past quarter century. The issues are illustrated by the on-
going phenomenon of pathological violence against women by their
mates or former mates{67}:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Baltimore, Md.</dt>

<dd>Daonna Barnes was forced into hiding with her children because,
since making threats is not a crime, police could not arrest her
former boyfriend for his threats to kill her. On August 11, 1989 he
discovered the location of her new apartment, broke in and shot and
stabbed her and a new boyfriend. Released on bail while awaiting
trial on charges of attempted murder, he continues to harass Ms.
Barnes who says: "I feel like there is nobody out there to help me.
It's as if [I'll have to wait until he kills me] for anyone to take
this seriously...."</dd>

<dt>Mishawaka, Ind.</dt>

<dd>Finally convicted of kidnapping and battery against her, Lisa
Bianco's husband was sentenced to seven years imprisonment. On
March 4, 1989 he took advantage of release on an 8 hour pass to
break into her house and beat her to death.</dd>

<dt>Los Angeles, Ca.</dt>

<dd>On Aug. 27, 1989 Maria Navarro called the Sheriff's Office to
report that her former husband was again threatening to kill her,
despite a restraining order she had obtained against him. The
dispatcher instructed her "If he comes over, don't let him in. Then
call us." Fifteen minutes later he burst in on her 27th birthday
party and shot her and three others dead. Noting that Ms. Navarro's
call was part of a perennial overload of 2,000 or more 911 calls
the Sheriff's Office receives daily, a spokesman frankly admitted
"Faced with the same situation again, in all probability the
response would be the same."</dd>

<dt>Denver, Colo.</dt>

<dd>On February 16, 1989, nine days after she filed for divorce,
Lois Lende's husband broke into her home, beat and stabbed her to
death and then shot himself to death.</dd>

<dt>Connecticut</dt>

<dd>Late last year Anthony "Porky" Young was sentenced to a year in
prison for stripping his girlfriend naked and beating her senseless
in front of her 4 year old son. "He says next time he's going to

death threats he has written her while in prison, the prison
authorities will have to release him when his year is up.</dd>

<hr />
Literally dozens of such newspaper stories appear each week around
the U.S. Even extreme anti-gun advocates must wonder if a society
that cannot protect its innocent victims should not leave them free
to choose to own a handgun for defense.{68} This section of the
paper is devoted to analyzing the arguments offered for denying
that choice. 

<h2>1. Police protection vs. the capacity to defend oneself--</h2>

<p>Perhaps the single most common argument against freedom of
choice is that personal self defense has been rendered obsolete by
the existence of a professional police force.{69} For decades anti-
gun officials in Washington, D.C., Chicago, San Francisco and New
York have admonished the citizenry that they don't need guns for
self-defense because the police will defend them. This advice is
mendacious: when those cities are sued for failure to provide
police protection, those same officials send forth their city
attorneys to invoke</p>

<dl>
<dd>[the] fundamental principle of American law that a government
and its agents are under no general duty to provide public
services, such as police protection, to any individual
citizen.{70}</dd>
</dl>

Even as a matter of theory (much less in fact), the police do NOT
exist to protect the individual citizen. Rather their function is
to deter crime in general by patrol activities, and by apprehension
after the crime has occurred. If circumstances permit, the police
should and will protect a citizen in distress. But they are not
legally duty bound even to do that, nor to provide any direct
protection -- no matter how urgent a distress call they may
receive. A fortiori the police have no duty to, and do not, protect
citizens who are under death threat, e.g. women threatened by
former boyfriends or husbands. 

<p>An illustrative case is Warren v District of Columbia in which
three rape victims sued the city under the following facts: Two of
the victims were upstairs when they heard the other being attacked
by men who had broken in downstairs. Half an hour having passed and
their roommate's screams having ceased, they assumed the police
must have arrived in response to their repeated phone calls. In
fact, their calls had somehow been lost in the shuffle while the
roommate was being beaten into silent acquiesence. When her
roommates went downstairs to see to her, as the court's opinion
graphically describes it, "For the next fourteen hours the women
were held captive, raped, robbed, beaten, forced to commit sexual
acts upon each other, and made to submit to the sexual demands" of
their attackers.</p>

<p>Having set out these facts, the District of Columbia's highest
court exonerated the District and its police, because (to
reiterate) it is</p>

<dl>
<dd>a fundamental principle of American law that a government and
its agents are under no general duty to provide public services,
such as police protection, to any individual citizen.{71}</dd>
</dl>

In addition to the caselaw I have cited, this principle has been
expressly enunciated over and over again in statute law.{72} 

<p>The fundamental principle that the police have no duty to
protect individuals derives equally from practical necessity and
from legal history. Historically there were no police, even in
large American or English cities, before almost the mid-19th
Century. Citizens were not only expected to protect themselves (and
each other), but legally required in response to the hue and cry to
chase down and apprehend criminals. The very idea of a police was
anathema, American and English liberalism viewing any such force as
a form of the dreaded "standing army."{73} This view yielded only
grudgingly to the fact that citizens were unwilling to spend their
leisure hours patrolling miles of city streets and incapable even
of chasing fleeing criminals down on crowded city streets -- much
less tracing and apprehending them or detecting surreptitious
crimes.</p>

<p>Eventually police forces were established to augment citizen
self-protection by systematic patrol to deter crime and to detect
and apprehend criminals if a crime occurs. Historically there was
no thought of the police displacing the citizen's right of self-
protection. Nor, as a practical matter, is that remotely feasible
in light of the demands a high crime society makes on the limited
resources available to police it. Even if all 500,000 American
police officers were assigned to patrol they could not protect 240
million citizens from upwards of 10 million criminals who enjoy the
luxury of deciding when and where to strike. But there are nothing
like 500,000 patrol officers: to determine how many police are
actually available on any one shift the 550,000 figure must be
divided by four (three shifts per day, plus officers on days-off,
sick leave etc.). After this calculation, the resulting number must
be cut in half to take account of the officers assigned to
investigations, juvenile, records, laboratory, traffic etc., rather
than patrol.{74}</p>

<p>Doubtless the deterrent effect of the police helps assure that
many Americans will never be so unfortunate as to live in
circumstances requiring personal protection. But for those who do
need such protection the fact is that police do not and cannot
function as bodyguards for ordinary people (though in New York and
other major cities police may perform bodyguard services for the
mayor and other prominent officials). Consider the matter just in
terms of the number of New York City women who each year seek
police help, reporting threats by ex-husbands, ex-boyfriends etc.:
to bodyguard just those women would exhaust the resources of the
nation's largest police department, leaving no officers available
for street patrol, traffic control, crime detection and
apprehension of perpetrators, responding to emergency calls etc.,
etc.{75}</p>

<p>Given what New York courts have called "the crushing nature of
the burden"{76}, the police cannot be expected to protect the
individual citizen. Individuals remain responsible for their own
personal safety, with police providing only an auxiliary general
deterrent. The issue is whether those individuals should be free to
choose gun ownership as a means of protecting themselves, their
homes and families.</p>

<h2>2. The defensive utility of victim firearms ownership --
pre-1980s analysis</h2>

<p>Until recently a combination of problematic data, lacunae and
legerdemain allowed anti-gun advocates to claim "The handgun owner
seldom even gets the chance to use his gun" -- "Guns purchased for
protection are rarely used for that purpose."{77} The evidence to
support this came from selective and manipulative rendition of pre-
1980s city-level figures on the number of violent felons whom
civilians lawfully kill. Due to lack of any better data these
lawful homicide data were the best available before the 1980s. But
anti-gun discussions did not mention the grave lacuna involved in
judging the amount of defensive gun use from the number of such
killings: the vast majority of civilian defensive gun uses are
excluded since they do not involve killing criminals but only
scaring them off or capturing them without death. Thus failure to
mention this fact speciously minimizes the extent of civilian
defensive gun use. Data now available shows that gun-armed
civilians capture or rout upwards of 30 times more criminals than
they kill.{78}</p>

<p>Exacerbating this problem of minimization was the highly
misleading way in which opponents of handgun ownership selected and
presented the pre-1980s lawful homicide data. Some big cities had
been keeping lawful homicide data since the 1910s. Naturally, many
more felons were killed by victims in high crime eras like the
1970s and 1980s, or the 1920s and 1930s (when victims tended to buy
and keep guns loaded and ready) than in the low crime era 1945-65.
For instance, Chicago figures going from the 1920s show: that
lawful civilian homicide constituted 31.4% of all homicides
(including fatal automobile accidents); that for decades the number
of felons killed by civilians roughly equalled those killed by
police; and that by the 1970s civilians were lawfully killing about
three times as many felons as were police. Yet no mention of
Chicago or this data (or comparable Washington, D.C. figures) will
be found in the anti-gun literature.{79}</p>

<p>Instead, that literature concentrated on Detroit. Even so it
somehow omitted the following pertinent facts: that in the 1920s
felons killed by civilians constituted 26.6% of all homicide in
Detroit{80}; that, as crime rose after 1965, civilian killings of
felons rose 1350% (by 1971) and continued rising so that, by the
late 1970s, twice as many felons were being lawfully killed by
civilians as police.{81}</p>

<p>Without mentioning any of this, even the most scrupulous of the
anti-gun analysts, Newton &amp; Zimring, advanced the highly
misleading claim that in the five years 1964-8 only "seven
residential burglars were shot and killed by" Detroit householders
and there were only "three cases of the victim killing a home
robber".{82} This is highly misleading because Newton &amp; Zimring
have truncated the lawful homicide data without informing readers
that they are omitting the two situations in which the great
majority of lawful defensive homicides occur: robbers killed by
shopkeepers and the homicidal assailant shot by his victim (e.g.
the abusive husband shot by the wife he is strangling). Had these
two categories not been surreptitiously omitted, Newton &amp;
Zimring's Detroit lawful civilian homicide figure would have been
27 times greater -- not 10, but rather 270 in the 1964-8
period.{83}</p>

<h2>3. 1980s data on the defensive efficacy of handguns</h2>

<p>In any event, all pre-1980s work has been eclipsed by more
recent data which allows estimation not only of how many felons
armed citizens kill annually but also of those they capture or
scare off. This evidence derives from private national surveys on
gun issues. Though sponsored by pro- or anti-gun groups the polls
were conducted by reputable independent polling organizations and
have all been accorded credibility by social scientists analyzing
gun issues.{84} Further evidencing the polls' accuracy, is that
their results are consistent (particularly their results on
defensive gun use), regardless of their sponsorship.{85} Moreover,
because the different surveys' data are mutually consistent, any
suspicion of bias or falsification may be precluded by simply not
using the data from the NRA-sponsored polls.</p>

<p>Based therefore only on the anti-gun polls, it is now clear that
handguns are used as or more often in repelling crimes annually as
in committing them, c. 645,000 defense uses annually vs. c. 580,000
criminal misuses.{86} Handguns are used another 215,000 times
annually to defend against dangerous snakes and animals. As to
their effectiveness, handguns work equally well for criminals and
victims: in about 83% of the cases in which an victim is faced with
a handgun, he (or she) submits; in 83% of the cases in which a
victim with a handgun confronts a criminal the criminal flees or
surrenders.</p>

<p>This victim survey data is confirmed by complementary data from
a survey among felons in state prisons across the country.
Conducted under the auspices of the National Institute of Justice,
the survey found 34% of the felons saying that</p>

<dl>
<dd>they had been "scared off, shot at, wounded or captured by an
armed victim," [quoting the actual question asked] and about
two-thirds (69%) had at least one acquaintance who had had this
experience.{87}</dd>
</dl>

In response to two other questions: 34% of the felons said that in
contemplating a crime they either "often" or "regularly" worried
that they "Might get shot at by the victim"; and 57% agreed that
"Most criminals are more worried about meeting an armed victim than
they are about running into the police."{88} 

<p>In sum: the claim that "Guns purchased for protection are rarely
used for that purpose" could not have been maintained by a full and
accurate rendition of even the pre-1980s data; and that claim is
definitively refuted by the comprehensive data that have been
collected in the 1980s under the auspices of the National Institute
of Justice and both pro- and anti-gun groups.</p>

<h2>4. Anti-gun obliviousness to women's defensive needs: (a) the
case of domestic and spousal homicide</h2>

<p>My point here is not that opponents of precautionary handgun
ownership are oblivious to domestic homicide, but only that they
are oblivious (or worse) to the situation of the woman in such
homicides. That obliviousness (or worse) is epitomized by the
failure to differentiate men from women in the ubiquitous anti-gun
admonition that: "the use of firearms for self-protection is more
likely to lead to ... death among family and friends than to the
death of an intruder."{89} This admonition misportrays domestic
homicide as if it were all murder and ignores the fact that c. 50%
of interspousal homicides are committed by abused wives.{90} To
understand domestic homicide it is necessary to distinguish
unprovoked murder from lawful self-defense against homicidal attack
-- a distinction which happens to correlate closely with the
distinction between husband and wife.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly when we look at criminal violence between
spouses we find that "91% were victimizations of women by their
husbands or ex-husbands...."{91} Thus, the 50% of interspousal
homicides in which husband kills wife are real murders -- but in
the overwhelming majority of cases where wife kills husband, she is
defending herself or the children.{92} In Detroit, for instance,
husbands are killed by wives more often than vice versa, yet men
are far more often convicted for killing a spouse -- because three-
quarters of wives who killed were not even charged, prosecutors
having found their acts lawful and necessary to preserve their
lives or their childrens'.{93}</p>

<p>In the vast majority of cases a woman who kills a man requires a
weapon (most often a handgun) to do so. Eliminating handguns from
American life would not decrease the total number of killings
between spouses. (If anything, it would increase it since, as we
have seen, gun armed victims may ward off 25-30 attack without
killing for every time they have to kill.) To eliminate handguns
would only change the sex of the decedents by assuring that in
virtually every case it would be the abused wife, not the murderous
husband. After all, a gun is of far more use to the victim than her
attacker. "Husbands, due to size and strength advantages, do not
need weapons to kill."{94} Having a gun is not necessary to attack
a victim who is unarmed, alone, small, frail ...[But] Even in the
hands of a weak and unskilled assailant a gun can be used ...
without much risk of effective counterattack ... [and] because
everyone knows that a gun has these attributes, the mere display of
a gun communicates a highly effective threat.{95} Of course it is
tragic when an abused woman has to kill a current or former mate.
But such killings can not be counted as if they were costs of
precautionary handgun ownership; rather they are palpable benefits,
from society's and the woman's point of view, if not from the
attacker's. Thus it is misleading to the point of wilful falsehood
for critics of handgun ownership to misrepresent such lawful
defensive killings as what, instead, they prevented -- domestic
murder.</p>

<p>A final tangential, but significant, point emerges from the
statistics on use of guns in domestic self-defense. Those
statistics strongly support the defensive efficacy of firearms. As
noted above, "Men who batter [wives] average 45 pounds heavier and
4 to 5 inches taller than" their victim.{96} If guns were not
effective for defense, a homicidal attack by a husband upon his
wife would almost invariably end in the death of the wife rather
than in his death c. 50% of the time.</p>

<h2>5. Anti-gun obliviousness to women's defensive needs: (b)
attacks by male acquaintances.</h2>

<p>In arguing against precautionary handgun ownership, anti-gun
authors purport to comprehensively refute the defensive value of
guns, i.e., to every kind of victim. Yet, without exception (and
without mentioning the omission), those authors omit to analyze the
acquaintance crime to which women are most often subjected. The
empirical evidence establishes that "women are more likely to be
assaulted, more likely to be injured, more likely to be raped, and
more likely to be killed by a male partner than by any other type
of assailant."{97} Yet, to a man (and, invariably, they are men)
anti-gun authors treat self-defense in terms of the gun owner's
fears "that a hostile stranger will invade his home".{98}</p>

<p>It is only by turning a blind eye to acquaintance crime that the
Chairman of Handgun Control Inc. can claim that "The handgun owner
rarely even gets the chance to use his gun." That assertion
restates the argument of Newton &amp; Zimring and the Handgun
Control Staff. They emphasized the unexpectedness of stranger
attacks -- from which they characterized it as "ludicrous" to think
a victim "will have sufficient time to retrieve" her
handgun.{99}</p>

<p>As discussed above, even as to stranger crime, this view is
supported only by Newton &amp; Zimring's inaccurate and misleading
rendition of pre-1980s data which is further discredited by
subsequent data available today. Moreover, in relation to violence
against women, the assertion that they would almost invariably be
too surprised by violent attack to be able to use a handgun in
self-defense is insupportable. On the contrary, in the clear
majority of instances, the man who beats or murders a woman, and
often even the rapist, is an acquaintance who has previously
assaulted her on one or more occasions.{100} Such crimes commonly
occur after protracted and bellicose argument over a long-simmering
dispute. The women's defensive homicide literature shows that such
a victim is almost uniquely positioned for self-defense: knowing
the mannerisms and circumstances that triggered or preceded her
attacker's prior attacks, she has</p>

<dl>
<dd>"a hypervigilance to cues of any kind of impending violence...
[She is] a little bit more responsive to situations than somebody
who has not been battered might be." A woman who has [previously]
been battered and then is threatened with more abuse is more likely
to perceive the danger involved faster than one who has not been
abused. {101}</dd>
</dl>

In this connection consider a point that anti-gun crusaders make in
another context, but ignore in this one. They (rightly) warn
victims that a defense gun may be of little use if attacked by
robber who is himself using a gun. The fact is that a gun is so
dangerous a weapon that it is extremely risky for a victim to
resist even if the victim him/herself has a gun. A basic dictum of
police and martial arts training is that even a trained
professional should never attack a gun-armed assailant unless
convinced that he is about to shoot (in which case there is nothing
to lose).{102} 

<p>The very strength of this point about the overwhelming power of
one who wields a gun should have provoked academic anti-gun
crusaders into at least considering a correlative question: where
does the balance of power lie between a victim who has a gun and an
attacker armed only with a knife or some other lesser weapon? Under
those circumstances it seems that the victim will usually have the
clear advantage (remembering Kleck's finding that in 83% of cases
in which a victim has a handgun the criminal surrenders or flees).
But anti-gun crusaders avoid the embarrassment of admitting that a
victim with a gun might have the advantage over a lesser-armed by
either ignoring the issue or assuming it away. Those anti-gun
analyses that expressly deal with the situation in which a victim
tries to use a gun against an attacker wantonly assume that in any
such situation the attacker will have a gun himself.{103} In fact,
however, in 89.6% of the violent crimes directed against women
during the ten years 1973-82, the offender did not have a gun{104};
only 10% of rapists used guns{105} and only 25% of non-strangers
who attacked victims (whether male or female) had any weapon
whatever.{106} In sum, the same strong arguments anti-gun analysts
offer against the wisdom of a victim resisting a gun-armed attacker
suggest that women with handguns will have the advantage since the
vast majority of rapists and other attackers do not have
guns.{107}</p>

<p>(At this point it may be appropriate to address the old bugaboo
that a woman who seeks to resist a male attacker will have her gun
taken away and used against her. It bears emphasis that this is
only a theoretical bugaboo: the rape literature contains no example
of such an occurrence.{108} Moreover police instructors and
firearms experts strongly reject its likelihood. Not only do they
aver that women are capable of gun-armed self-defense{109} they
find women much easier to properly train than men, since women lack
the masculine ego problems which cause the men to stubbornly resist
accepting instruction. Viz. the experience of a police academy
instructor who simultaneously trained a male police academy class
and a class of civilian women "most of [whom] had never held a
revolver, much less fired one"; after one hour on the range and two
hours classroom instruction in the Chattanooga Police Academy
combat pistol course the women consistently outshot police cadets
who had just received eight times as much formal instruction and
practice.{110})</p>

<h2>6. Anti-gun obliviousness to women's defensive needs: (c)
rape.</h2>

<p>Anti-gun academics necessarily neglect to analyze the value of a
gun in defending against rape because, almost to a man, they eschew
any mention of rape.{111} This surprising omission cannot be
explained as a mere side effect of ignoring acquaintance crimes.
After all, many rapists are strangers rather than acquaintances;
indeed, many rapes are committed in the course of the kinds of
crimes the anti-gun literature does address, robbery and
burglary.{112} But, almost invariably, the "intruder" whom anti-gun
authors discuss is not rapist but a "robber" whom they represent as
"confront[ing] too swiftly" for rape or a "burglar" whom they
represent as breaking only into unoccupied homes.{113}</p>

<p>This obliviousness to women's self-defense in general, and to
rape in particular, leaves anti-gun authors free to deprecate the
defensive utility of guns on grounds that don't apply to most
circumstances in which women use guns defensively. Anti-gun works
correctly stress that it is illegal to shoot to prevent mere car
theft, shoplifting or trespass on land (i.e. not involving entry
into the home itself).{114} In contrast, the law allows a woman to
shoot a rapist or homicidal attacker.{115} Also, in some cases, a
man attacked by another man of comparable size and strength may be
hard put to justify his need to shoot; but this is far less of a
problem for a female victim of male attack.{116}</p>

<p>In short, to the extent academic anti-gun crusaders have made
valid point about armed self-defense these points do not apply to
women. The anti-gun crusaders avoid acknowledging this by the
simple device of never mentioning rape, or women's armed self-
defense, at all. One anti-gun writer, Drinan, did discuss rape,
albeit not entirely voluntarily; he was responding to an article in
which I highlighted the issue as a justification for allowing women
the freedom to choose to own guns for self-defense. Drinan
responded, in essence, that women detest guns and don't want to own
them for self-defense.{117} This response is both factually and
conceptually erroneous. It is factually erroneous because the
evidence shows that currently (though not necessarily when Drinan
wrote) women constitute one half of purely precautionary gun
owners. It is conceptually erroneous because freedom of choice is a
residual value even as to things that many or most people do not
now want to choose, and even if they may never want to.</p>

<p>Newton &amp; Zimring's chapter on self-defense dismisses women's
concerns about self-defense against rape (or, presumably, other
kind of attack) in one contemptuous sentence to the effect that
"women generally are less capable of self-defense [than men] and
less knowledgeable about guns."{118} Feminist outrage about this
derisive comment may account for the fact that Prof. Zimring's
subsequent writings, including the chapter on self-defense in a
1987 book, prudently eschew any attempt to deal with women's right
to, or capacity for, self-defense with guns.{119}</p>

<p>Other anti-gun treatments do not specifically address rape
beyond their general position that victims should always submit to
criminals unless flight is possible: the best way to "keep you
alive [is to] put up no defense -- give them what they want or run"
advises Handgun Control, Inc.{120} However unacceptable that advice
may be to feminists, at least it avoids the confusion that marks
the discussion of gun-armed defense against rape by the Handgun
Control Staff of the U.S. Conference of Mayors. For the first 31 of
its 36 pages the HANDGUN CONTROL STAFF pamphlet harps on the
prohibitive dangers of any kind of physical resistance to crime.
Throughout, the Handgun Control Staff's argument against
precautionary gun ownership consists in warning against handguns or
any other form of physical resistance -- the risk of any kind of
physical resistance is so high that victims should always submit to
attackers.{121}</p>

<p>But when the Handgun Control Staff finally get to rape, it
offers a startling volte face -- all the more startling because it
lacks even an explanation, much less a justification of its
contradicting all that has preceded it. The Handgun Control Staff
just blithely announces that women don't need handguns to resist
rape because of "the effectiveness of other means of resistance
such as verbal and physical resistance".{122} Yet, if the authors
believe their own prior warnings, "physical resistance" is
prohibitively dangerous; e.g. the Pamphlet's twice-repeated point
(each time in italics) that "a victim is more than eight times as
likely to be killed when using a self-protective measure" of any
kind;{123} or its more general admonition (again in italics) that
"victims who resist experience much higher rates of fatality and
injury."{124}</p>

<p>The HANDGUN CONTROL STAFF pamphlet also points out that many
rapes do not occur in the victim's home but in other locations
where she presumably would not be legally entitled to carry a gun.
But this highlights the fact that the majority of rapes do occur in
the victim's home where she is entitled to have a gun (in all but
the few jurisdictions like Washington, D.C. where victims are not
permitted to have guns for self-defense). In short, the majority of
rapes occur where a woman may legally have a gun and the empirical
evidence is that in 83% of the cases it will protect her from being
raped.</p>

<h2>7. Incidence of injury to handgun-armed victims who resist
criminal attack.</h2>

<p>Some readers may object that the preceding section of this paper
shirks the crucial issue of victim injury by veering off onto the
side-issue of intellectual honesty. Yes (they may say) the Handgun
Control Staff's discussion of rape is inconsistent to the point of
dishonesty; nevertheless, the pamphlet does marshall impressive
data that victims who resist are often seriously hurt or
killed.{125} Does that data not validate Zimring, Hawkins and
Handgun Control, Inc. in teaching that victims ought to submit to
rapists, robbers or other violent criminals: the best way to "keep
you alive [is to] put up no defense -- give them what they want or
run."{126}</p>

<p>The short answer is that the data the HANDGUN CONTROL STAFF
pamphlet presents is irrelevant to the risk of injury to victims
who resist with a handgun. This pre-1980s data does not deal with
guns specifically. It gives only a conglomerate figure for the
percentage of victims injured or killed when resisting physically
in any way whatever. This conglomerate figure includes some few
victims who resisted with a gun, many more who used knivee, clubs
or some makeshift weapon, and many who resisted totally unarmed. It
is crucial to distinguish resistance with a gun from all other
kinds of resistance, because a gun differs qualitatively from all
other weapons in its defensive value. Criminals generally select
victims who are weaker than themselves. Only a gun gives weaker,
older, less aggressive victims equal or better chances against a
stronger attacker; as even Zimring and Hawkins state, guns empower
"persons [who are] physically or psychologically unable to
overpower [another] through violent physical contact."{127}</p>

<p>The difference is evident in post-1978 National Crime Survey
data which do allow us to distinguish victim injury in cases of
gun-armed resistance from victim injury where resistance was with
lesser weapons, and from cases of non-resistance. Ironically, the
results validate the anti-gun critics' danger-of-injury concerns as
to every form of resistance except with a gun. The gun-armed
resister was actually much less likely to be injured than the non-
resister, who was, in turn, much less likely to be injured than
those who resisted without a gun. Only 12-17% of the gun armed
resisters were injured. Those who submitted to the felons' demands
were twice as likely to be injured (gratuitously); those resisting
without guns were three times as likely to be injured as those with
guns.{128}</p>

<p>(It bears emphasis that these results do NOT mean that a gun
allows victims to resist, regardless of circumstances. In many
cases submission will be the wiser course Indeed, what the victim
survey data suggests differs startlingly from both pro- and
anti-gun stereotypes: keeping a gun for defense may induce sober
consideration of the dangers of reckless resistance; their low
injury rate may show that gun owners are not only better able to
resist, but to evaluate when to submit, than are non-owners who,
having never seriously contemplated those choices, must suddenly
decide between them.)</p>

<h2>8. The "submission position" in white, male academia</h2>

<p>By the "submission position", of course, I mean the view
embraced by various anti-gun scholars that victims should submit to
felons rather than offering forcible resistance of any kind; if an
attacker cannot be "talked out" of his crime, the victim should
comply in order to avoid injury.{129} Not insignificantly, the
academic proponents of the submission position are all white
males.{130}</p>

<p>This is significant insofar as the submission position is
conditioned by the relative immunity to crime its proponents enjoy
due to their racial, sexual and economic circumstances. In general,
the submission position literature does not even mention rape.
Equally significant, it treats robbery as the once-in-a-lifetime
danger it is for a salaried white academic. His risk of meeting a
robber is so low that he is unlikely to keep a gun ready for that
eventuality. Moreover, submitting once in his life to the loss of
the money in his wallet may well be "the better part of valor" for
the kind of victim who can replace that money by a trip to his ATM
and can minimize the loss by taking it off his taxes. A very
different calculus of costs and benefits of resisting may apply
to</p>

<dl>
<dd>an elderly Chicano whom the San Francisco Examiner reports has
held onto his grocery by outshooting fifteen armed robbers [while]
nearby stores have closed because thugs have either bankrupted them
or have casually executed their unresisting proprietors... [Or]
welfare recipients whom robbers target, knowing when their checks
come and where they cash them [or] the elderly trapped in
deteriorating neighborhoods (like the Manhattan couple who in 1976
hanged themselves in despair over repeatedly losing their pension
checks and furnishings to robbers).{131}</dd>
</dl>

Regrettably, for many victims crime is not the isolated
happenstance it is for white male academics.{132} Let us
hypothesize a Black shopkeeper; perhaps a retired Marine master
sergeant who has invested the life savings from "20-years-and out"
in the only store he can afford. Not coincidentally, it is located
in an area where robbery insurance is prohibitively high or
unobtainable at any price. In deciding whether to submit to robbery
or resist, he and others who live or work in such areas must weigh
a factor which finds no place in the submission position
literature: that to survive they may have to establish a reputation
for not being easily victimized.{133} The submission position
literature is equally oblivious to the special factors that may
have importance for rape victims; even one rape -- much less
several -- may cause catastrophic psychological injury that may be
worsened by submission, mitigated by even unsuccessful
resistance.{134} 

<p>By no means am I arguing that resistance with guns (or without)
is optimum for crime victims in any or all situations. I am only
noting additional factors that really ought to be considered by
well-salaried white, male intellectuals presume (as I certainly
would not) to tell the kind of people who are most often crime
victims what is best for them. It is presumptuous for scholars,
however learned, to pontificate as to what course is best for an
individual victim whose values and situation they may not share.
Consider the reflections of a woman who (without a gun)
successfully resisted rape:</p>

<dl>
<dd>I believed he would kill me if I resisted. But the other part
was that I would try to kill him first because I guess that for me,
at that time in my life, it would have been better to have died
resisting rape than to have been raped.</dd>

<dd>I decided I wasn't going to die. It seemed a waste to die on
the floor of my apartment so I decided to fight.{135}</dd>
</dl>

<h1>COMPARISONS BETWEEN NATIONS AND OVER TIME</h1>

<p>Anti-gun crusaders are addicted to the making of foreign
comparisons which constitute probably the single most pernicious
source of misinformation and misunderstanding of gun regulation
issues. This misinformation and misunderstanding (which are also
involved in comparisons made across time) result from a grotesque
mix of statistical misrepresentation with partisan selection and
presentation, and sheer historical ignorance.</p>

<p>Such comparisons are used to argue that gun ownership causes
crime -- a causation that supposedly results in the U.S. having
more homicide per capita (i.e., a higher rate of murder) than do
selected other countries which virtually prohibit gun ownership. In
fact, the determinants of the relative amounts of violence in
nations are socio-cultural and institutional. The effects of such
basic determinants cannot be offset by any gun control strategy, no
matter how well-crafted and rigorous. Reducing availability of any
other particular kind of weapon, including guns, in general cannot
radically decrease crime because the number of guns that are
illegally available will always suffice for those who are
determined to obtain and misuse them.</p>

<h2>1. Do international homicide rate differentials reflect gun
availability or socio-cultural differences?</h2>

<p>Two examples of socio-cultural differences that result in widely
different murder rates come immediately to mind. The first is the
unknown (to Americans) fact that each year hundreds of men in Japan
murder their families and then kill themselves. This is so much a
tradition of Japanese culture that it was not even a crime until
fairly recently. Japanese murder rates remain admirably low because
they exclude these "family suicides".{136}</p>

<p>Second, compare America's high murder rate to Europe's far
higher suicide rates: sociologist Seymour Martin Lipset has
suggested that cultural factors cause disturbed Americans to strike
out against others whereas disturbed Europeans tend to turn their
violence on themselves. This helps explain the details of American
and European statistics set out in the International Intentional
Homicide Table, below.</p>

<p>In contrast, blaming gun ownership explains nothing because that
interpretation is flatly inconsistent with the international
statistical evidence. If gun ownership were a major "cause" of
crime and gun availability a major factor in the amount of criminal
homicide: a) nations where gun availability is as or more
widespread than in the U.S. would uniformly have appreciably higher
murder rates than the norm for demographically comparable
nations;{137}; and b) nations which ban or severely restrict gun
ownership would have appreciably lower homicide rates than the U.S.
at least. Yet, as the International Intentional Homicide Table set
out below shows, the homicide rates in nations where gun
availability exceeds the U.S. (e.g., Israel, New Zealand and
Switzerland{138}) are as low as those of the highly gun-restrictive
Western European and British Commonwealth countries to which
America is frequently adversely compared. Moreover, the two nations
which very severely restrict gun ownership (and punish violation
with death), Taiwan and South Africa, both have far higher
apolitical murder rates than the U.S.</p>

<h2>2. Historical ignorance and the anti-gun crusade</h2>

<p>Likewise, the historical evidence refutes the attribution of
differential international violence rates to differences in gun
laws rather than socio-institutional and cultural differences.
Those who attribute low European violence rates to banning guns are
apparently unaware that those low rates long preceded the gun
bans.{139} In fact, stringent gun laws first appeared in the U.S.,
not Europe -- despite which high American crime rates persisted and
grew.{140} Ever-growing violence in various American states from
the 1810s on, led them to pioneer ever more severe gun
controls.{141} But in Europe, where violence was falling, or was
not even deemed an important problem, gun controls varied from the
lax to the non- existent. During the 19th Century in England, for
instance, crime fell from its high in the late 18th Century to its
idyllic early 20th Century low -- yet the only gun control was that
police could not carry guns.{142}</p>

<p>In considering reasons for the differentials between U.S. and
British homicide historically, Prof. Monckkonen rejects the
conventional explanations including gun ownership, remarking:</p>

<dl>
<dd>Virtually every analysis put forward to explain the
[comparatively] very high United States homicide rate has been
ahistorical.... Had they been proposed as historical, they would
have foundered quickly for the explanatory inadequacy of these
"pet" theories becomes immediately apparent in a historical
context.{143}</dd>
</dl>

When most European countries finally began enacting gun laws in the
post-WWI period, the motivation was not crime (with which those
countries had been little afflicted) but terrorism and the
political violence from which they have continued to suffer to the
present day far more than the U.S. ever has.{144} This difference
is reflected in a practice that helps to keep official English
murder rates so admirably low: English statistics do not include
"political" murders, e.g. those by the IRA, whereas the American
statistics include every kind of murder and manslaughter.) The
different purposes of European versus American laws is evidenced by
their diametrically opposite patterns: many of the "Saturday Night
Special" laws American states enacted to deal with 19th Century
crime banned all but standard military- issue revolvers, i.e. the
very expensive large, heavy Colt. In stark contrast, such military
caliber arms were the first guns banned in post-WWI Europe, the
purpose being to disarm restive former soldiers and the para-
military groups they formed.{145} 

<p>Moreover, if greater American gun relative availability were the
cause of international crime differences, the difference in crime
would only be as to crimes with guns. Yet American rates for
robbery, rape and other violent crimes committed without guns are
enormously higher than the rates for such crimes (with and without
guns, combined) which are uniformly low among Western European,
British Commonwealth etc. countries regardless of whether they
allow or ban gun ownership. England's leading gun control analyst
sardonically disposes of the issues with two rhetorical questions:
1) How do those who blame "lax American gun laws" for the far
higher U.S. rate of gun crime explain its also having far more
knife crime: do they think that Englishmen have to get a permit to
own a butcher knife?; and 2) How do those who attribute U.S. gun
murders to greater gun availability explain the far higher U.S.
rate of stranglings and of victims being kicked to death: do they
think that Americans "have more hands and feet than" Britons?
Flatly asserting that, no matter how stringent the gun laws, there
will always be enough guns in any society to arm those desiring to
obtain and use them illegally, he attributes grossly higher
American violence rates "not to the availability of any particular
class of weapon" but to socio-cultural and institutional factors
which dictate</p>

<dl>
<dd>that American criminals are more willing to use extreme
violence[; quoting a report of the British Office of Health
Economics:] "One reason often given for the high numbers of murders
and manslaughters in the United States is the easy availability of
firearms.... But the strong correlation with racial and linked
socio-economic variables suggests that the underlying determinants
of the homicide rate relate to particular cultural
factors."{146}</dd>
</dl>

<h2>3. If increasing gun ownership caused American murder rates to
rise in the 1960s, did it also cause them to stabilize in the 1970s
and fall in the 1980s?</h2>

<p>The theory that widespread gun ownership causes murder seemed
plausible to Americans in the 1960s when ever-increasing gun sales
went hand-in-hand with (actually, were a reaction to) ever-
increasing crime rates. But this interpretation is exploded when
the time frame is expanded to include statistics from the 1970s and
1980s. In those decades, handgun ownership continued to rise by c.
2 million per year, so that the American handgun-stock increased
from 24-29 million in 1968 to 65-70 million in 1988. Yet homicide
actually fell somewhat and handgun (and other gun) homicides
decreased markedly.{147} The point is even more striking in
comparison to the English homicide rate: in 1974 the American rate
was 40 times the English; 15 years (and 30 million more American
handguns) later, the American rate was only ten times greater.{148}
Since this trend occurred in decades in which English gun law
severity increased, both administratively and by added legislative
rstrictions, it cannot be explained by attributing murder to
widespread gun availability.</p>

<p>The attribution is further undermined if violent crimes are
differentiated by type. Anti-gun academic crusaders do not claim
that buying a handgun suddenly turns otherwise law abiding people
to rape, robbery and burglary. Yet it was such crimes (and murder
in the course of them) that grew spectacularly from the mid-1960s
on. In contrast, there was no increase in the domestic homicides
the sages theorize guns cause. (Indeed, the c. 100% increase in
handguns in the era 1968-79 was followed by a 26.6% decrease in
domestic homicide from 1984 on -- despite the addition of another
c. 2,000,000 handguns in 1980 and each succeeding year.{149})</p>

<h2>4. Concealing the declining American murder trend by combining
suicide and murder statistics</h2>

<p>Anti-gun sages have seized on a new device in order not to have
to deal with these embarrassing facts. They conceal the fact of
declining American homicide (particularly gun homicide) by adding
in suicide figures, producing a combined "Intentional Homicide"
rate which they then claim to be "caused" by widespread gun
ownership.{150} Yet these same anti-gun academics continue to
compare the American murder rate (alone) to the murder rates of
specially selected foreign countries -- without mentioning that
virtually every country they select to compare has enormously
higher suicide rate than the U.S. For instance, Prof. Baker, the
originator of the combined homicide-suicide approach, compares
American and Danish murder rates, placing great emphasis on the
fact that the American rate is higher by about 7 per 100,000
population. Yet Baker somehow forgets to mention that making the
same comparison as to suicide rate would show the Danish rate to be
much higher yet than the American: higher by 16.5 deaths per
hundred thousand. Nor, of course, does Baker mention that when
suicide and murder figures are combined according to the Baker
method, the Danish death rate per 100,000 population is almost 50%
higher than the American.{151}</p>

<p>Despite their reliance on international murder comparisons, none
of the anti-gun academics who apply the combined murder- suicide
figure approach (in describing American figures) follow the
combined figure approach when making those international
comparisons. Could that have anything to do with the following
facts which emerge from the International Intentional Homicide
Table (below): that of 18 nations for which figures were available,
the U.S. ranks only 11th in intentional homicide; that its combined
homicide/suicide rate is less than half of the suicide rate alone
in gun-banning Hungary and less than 1/3 the suicide rate alone of
gun-banning Rumania; that New Zealand ranks 16th despite a rate of
gun ownership that far exceeds the U.S.'; and that the lowest rate
on the Table is for Israel, a country that actually encourages and
requires almost universal gun ownership.</p>

</pre>

<p>The evidence from international comparisons is confirmed by the
various neutral attempts to determine whether gun ownership causes
violence footnoted earlier and by the most extensive and
methodologically sophisticated study, Kleck's application of
modern, computer-assisted statistical techniques to post-World War
II American crime rate data. The interactive cause and effect
result he found contradicts that posited by anti-gun crusaders.
Kleck concludes that from the 1960s on fear engendered by violent
crime sparked enormously increased gun ownership among the general
populace. This increased gun ownership did not itself increase
crime of any kind (if anything, it dampened it); but an increase in
gun ownership, or at least in gun use, by criminals helped cause
the post-1960 increases violent crime, including murder.{153}</p>

<p>It may be of interest that Kleck simultaneously investigated the
possible effect of the cessation of capital punishment of the 1960s
and '70s in causing the crime wave. He concludes that the increased
violence was also not attributable to the cessation of capital
punishment caused. Note also that this criminological evidence does
not support the gun lobby's myopic opposition to gun controls. On
the contrary, Kleck endorses sweeping, strongly enforced laws
against possession of any kind of firearm by persons convicted of
any kind of felony.{154}</p>

<p>Guns are more lethal than some other means of death, though less
lethal than others such as hanging, certain poisons and falls from
great heights. Because of their lethality guns may facilitate
murder or suicide among those inclined to them anyway. On the other
hand, they are also incomparably the most effective means by which
a victim may resist violent attack.</p>

<h1>MASSACRES</h1>

<dl>
<dt>July, 1984:</dt>

<dd>an unemployed and apparently deranged security guard with a
shotgun killed 21 customers and employees at a San Ysidro,
California MacDonalds Hamburger outlet.</dd>

<dt>August, 1986:</dt>

<dd>a National Guard marksmanship instructor who had been
discharged from his job as a postal worker killed 15 former co-
workers in an Oklahoma Post Office.</dd>

<dt>February, 1988:</dt>

<dd>a disgruntled employee in Sunnyvale, Ca. killed 7 and wounded
four fellow employees with a shotgun.</dd>

<dt>January, 1989:</dt>

<dd>a petty criminal and former mental patient with an assault
rifle killed 5 children and wounded 30 other people in a Stockton,
Ca. schoolyard.</dd>

<dt>Setpember, 1989:</dt>

<dd>a suicidal manic-depressive with an assault rifle killed 8 and
wounded 12 in a Louisville, Ky. industrial plant.</dd>
</dl>

In each of these incidents the perpetrator committed suicide or
remained on the scene to be killed, eschewing any opportunity to
escape before the police arrived. 

<p>It is deceptive for gun prohibition-confiscation advocates to
use the pathos and horror induced by such tragedies -- and by
assassinations -- to argue their case.{155} In more candid moments
they concede that it is impossibile to take guns away from those
who are determined to misuse them: "No amount of control will stop
a determined assassin -- or a determined street robber -- from
getting a gun."{156} The theory of gun prohibition is bottomed on
an entirely different claim. That claim (which is examined in the
next section of this paper) is that guns cause acquaintance or
domestic homicides committed, supposedly, by the ordinary
law-abiding citizenry who would never have killed if they had not
had access to a gun in a moment of wild anger.{157}</p>

<p>In sum, no confiscation effort, however broad or stringent will
disarm hardened criminals, much less political terrorists or
killers so highly motivated for personal reasons as to undertake
massacres that are substantially likely to result in their own
deaths. On the contrary, if massacre were a serious threat to life
in the U.S., probably the best policy response would be that of
Israel which depends upon the defensive value of widespread
precautionary gun possession among vast sectors of the populace.
Consider an incident in a Jerusalem cafe just four months prior to
the California MacDonalds massacre: three terrorists who tried to
machine-gun the crowd were able to kill only 1 victim before being
shot down by handgun-armed Israelis. When presented to the press
the next day, the surviving terrorist bitterly explained that his
group had not realized that Israeli civilians were armed. The
terrorists had planned to machine-gun a succession of crowd spots,
believing that they would be able to escape before the police or
army could arrive to deal with them.{158}</p>

<p>In sum, anti-gun policies not only offer no solution for the
massacre situation, but are detrimental in precluding whatever
chance the victims might have to protect themselves in the crucial
time before the police can arrive on the scene.{159} Please note
that I am not necessarily suggesting this as a model for American
policy. Because terrorism is Israel's most pressing criminal
justice problem, Israel maximizes the presence of armed citizens by
firearms training and encouraging gun ownership and carrying by
almost the entire populace (Jews of both sexes and for the Druse
and other pro-Israeli Arabs). The advisability of such measures is
quite different for the U.S. where military training is not
universal even for males.</p>

<p>Arguably the issue does not even merit examination since
massacres represent a very small part of the American homicide
problem. Melodramatic as they were, if the death total for all the
massacres I have listed is combined, it still constitutes less than
1% of the American murder total in any single year. But there is a
tangential significance to the manner in which anti-gun advocates
have exploited the massacre issue for which they (in calmer
moments) admit their proposals have no value. By capitalizing on
the emotions these tragedies arouse, anti-gun advocates display a
cynical unscrupulousness that is wildly at variance with their
pretensions of moral superiority over the gun lobby. Indeed, this
may help explain the agreement of members of Congress in a recent
poll that the two lobby groups which provide them the most
consistently reliable information are the American Library
Association and the National Rifle Association.</p>

<h1>THE LAW ABIDING GUN OWNER AS ACQUAINTANCE &amp; DOMESTIC
MURDERER</h1>

<p>Conceding that banning handguns would not disarm terrorists,
assassins etc., the anti-gun argument portrays them as exceptions
to the generality, which is "previously law abiding citizens
committing impulsive gun-murders while engaged in arguments with
family members or acquaintances."{160} The anti-gun crusaders deem
most murder to result from gun ownership among such ordinary
citizens: "That gun in the closet to protect against burglars will
most likely be used to shoot a spouse in a moment of rage....The
problem is you and me -- law-abiding folks."{161}</p>

<p>If this portrayal of murderers were true, a gun ban might
drastically reduce murder because the primary perpetrators (the law
abiding) might give up guns even though hardened criminals,
terrorists and assassins would not. Unfortunately for this
appealingly simple nostrum, every national and local study of
homicide reveals that murderers are not at all ordinary citizens --
nor are they people who are likely to comply with gun laws.
Murderers (and fatal gun accident perpetrators) are atypical,
highly aberrant individuals whose spectacular indifference to human
life, including their own, is evidenced by life histories of
substance abuse, automobile accident, felony and attacks on
relatives and acquaintances.{162}</p>

<h2>1. The prior felony record of murderers</h2>

<p>The F.B.I.'s annual crime reports do not regularly compile data
on the prior criminal records of murderers and no such data are
otherwise available on a national basis. But in a special data run
for the Eisenhower Commission, the FBI found that 74.7% of murder
arrestees nationally over a four year period had had prior
arrest(s) for violent felony or burglary.{163} In another one year
period 77.9% of murder arrestees had priors.{164} Over yet another
five year period, nationally: arrested murderers had adult criminal
records showing an average prior criminal career of at least six
years duration including four major felony arrests; 57.1% of these
murder arrestees had been convicted of at least one of these prior
adult felonies; and 64% of a national sample of convicted murderers
who had been released were rearrested within four years.{165}</p>

<p>These data are confirmed by numerous local studies over the past
40 years.{166} For instance, a Washington, D.C. profile showed that
a typical murderer there had six prior arrests, two for felonies,
one violent.{167} Note that these data do not even begin to
comprise the full extent of murderers' prior criminal careers --
and thus how different murderers are from the ordinary law-abiding
person. Much serious crime goes unreported. Of those crimes that
are reported a large number are never cleared by arrest; and of
those so cleared many are juvenile arrests that are not counted in
the data recounted above. At the same time we know that most
juvenile, unsolved or unreported serious crimes are concentrated in
the relatively small part of our population who have been arrested
for other crimes.{168}</p>

<h2>2. The prior violence history of wife murderers</h2>

<p>Intrafamily murderers are especially likely to have engaged in
far more previous violent crime than show up in their arrest
records. But because these were attacks on spouses and/or other
family members, they will rarely have resulted in an arrest.{169}
So domestic murderers' official records tend not to show their full
prior violence, but only their adult arrests for attacking people
outside their families. Therefore only about "seventy to seventy-
five percent of domestic homicide offenders have been previously
arrested and about half previously convicted."{170} As to how many
crimes they perpetrate within the family, even in a relatively
short space of time, "review of police records in Detroit and
Kansas City" shows that in</p>

<dl>
<dd>90% of the cases of domestic homicide, police had responded at
least once to a disturbance call at the home during the two year
period prior to the fatal incident, and in over half (54%) of the
cases, they had been called five or more times.{171}</dd>
</dl>

A leading authority on domestic homicide notes: "The day-to- day
reality is that most family murders are preceded by a long history
of assaults...." Studies (including those just cited) "indicate
that intrafamily homicide is typically just one episode in a long
standing syndrome of violence."{172} Nor is "acquaintance homicide"
accurately conceptualized as a phenomenon of previously law-abiding
people killing each other in neighborhood arguments. The term
"acquaintance homicide" covers, and far more typically it is
exemplified by, e.g. a drug addict killing his dealer in the course
of robbing him; a loan shark or bookie killing a non-paying
customer; gang members, drug dealers, and members of organized
crime "families" killing each other.{173} 

<h2>3. Non sequitur and fabrication as a basis for claiming that
murderers are ordinary citizens rather than violent aberrants</h2>

<p>In contrast to these evaluations, neither of the data sets cited
as supporting claims that murderers "are good citizens who kill
each other" is persuasive. The National Coalition to Ban Handgun's
assertion "Most murders are committed by a relative or close
acquaintance of the victim"{174} is conceptually unpersuasive
because it is a non sequitur: it simply does not follow from the
fact that a murderer knows or is related to his victims that he
must be an ordinary citizen rather than a long time criminal. That
would only follow if ordinary citizens differ from criminals in
that criminals neither know anyone nor are related to anyone.</p>

<p>The other data set supposedly showing murderers are ordinary
citizens is Lindsay's assertion that "most murderers (73% in 1972)
are committed by previously law abiding citizens committing
impulsive gun-murders while engaged in arguments with family
members or acquaintances."{175} While there is nothing conceptually
wrong with this it is empirically unpersuasive because it is simply
a fabrication. Lindsay cites it to the FBI 1972 UNIFORM CRIME
REPORT. But that REPORT offers no such statistic; rather it and
other FBI data diametrically contradict it. Far from showing that
73% of murderers nationally were "previously law abiding citizens",
they show that 74.7% of persons arrested for murder had prior
arrest(s) for a violent felony or burglary.{176}</p>

<dl>
<dd>As the Abstract to the NIJ Evaluation concludes: It is commonly
hypothesized that much criminal violence, especially homicide,
occurs simply because the means of lethal violence (firearms) are
readily at hand, and thus, that much homicide would not ocrur were
firearms generally less available. There is no persuasive evidence
that supports this view.{177}</dd>
</dl>

I emphasize that this does NOT refute the case for gun control,
including rationally tailored gun bans. The fact that murderers are
"real criminals" with life histories of violence, felony, substance
abuse and auto accident highlights the danger in such people having
handguns -- or guns of any kind!{178} But it is very misleading
when homicide statistics idiosyncratic to gun misusers are
presented as arguing for banning guns to the whole populace.
Idiosyncratic statistics from such idiosyncratic people provide no
basis for the claim that precautionary gun ownership by average
citizens seriously endangers their friends or relatives. 

<h1>GUN ACCIDENTS</h1>

<h2>1. Fatalities among children.</h2>

<p>To emphasize accidental handgun fatalities among children,
Handgun Control, Inc. runs nationally an advertisement which
pictures an infant playing with a pistol. An academic-produced
video for schools and libraries solemnly asserts that "a child is
accidentally killed by a handgun every day" (i.e., 365 per
year).{179} Two academic anti-gun crusaders put the accidental
death toll at "almost 1,000 children" per year.{180}</p>

<p>Fortunately these assertions are grotesque exaggerations. In
fact, the National Safety Council figures of identifiable handgun
accidental fatality average only 246 people of all ages per
year.{181} For children alone, the identifiable handgun average
was: 10-15 accidental fatalities per year for children under age
five; and 50-55 yearly for children under age fifteen.{182}</p>

<p>Obviously it is a terrible tragedy when a child dies in a an
accident, whether with a handgun or otherwise. But that does not
justify falsifying statistics in order to concoct an argument for
banning handguns. As discussed in the next section of this paper,
fatal gun accidents (including those involving children) are
largely attributable to gun possession among the same kinds of
irresponsible aberrant adults who are responsible for murders. Some
feasible controls proposals for reducing child (and other)
accidental firearms deaths are offered in the penultimate section
of this paper. As to the advisability of going beyond controls to
banning handguns, the 13 children under 5 who died in handgun
accidents may be compared to the 381 such children who in 1980
drowned in swimming pools. Yet nobody would demand even a ban on
new swimming pools -- much less that all those who currently own
pools be required to fill them in.</p>

<p>Anti-gun fanatics are wont to exclaim that even if a gun ban
saves only one life it is worth it. That has special appeal if the
lives being saved are those of very young children. But if they
feel prohibiting/confiscating upwards of 70 million handguns is
justifed to save 13 young children's lives (and confiscating
upwards of 200 million guns of all types to save 34 children), why
does saving 381 annually not justify banning swimming pools, or at
least prohibiting their proliferation? Is it possible that anti-gun
fanatics are motivated more by hatred of guns and their owners than
by saving lives? Of course, handguns and swimming pools are very
different things that may merit very different policy responses.
Among the relevant differences are that, unlike handguns, pools are
not used to defend against c. 645,000 crimes each year and do not
save thousands of innocent lives.</p>

<p>The disparity is even more striking in regard to fatalities
caused by cigarettes. Compare the 10-15 children under age five who
die in handgun accidents annually to the 432 who die in residential
fires caused by adults who doze off while smoking.{183} Not only do
we not not forbid smoking in the home, the federal government
actually pays tobacco farmers subsidies to grow their crops. Yet
cigarettes, which have absolutely no social utility (except perhaps
for the subjective pleasure they give smokers), take hundreds of
times more lives than do handguns in accident, murder and suicide
combined. In that connection, it may be noted that we also do not
ban alcoholic beverages, though people under their influence commit
more murders and suicides than occur with handguns -- and hundreds
of times more fatal accidents and non-fatal violent crimes.{184}
(If it be suggested that we repealed Prohibition only because it
proved unenforceable, the short answer is that a handgun ban is
less enforceable yet.{185})</p>

<h2>2. The Aberrance of Gun Accident Perpetrators.</h2>

<p>My reason for limiting the preceding discussion primarily to
children is that the issues that arise with adults who perpetrate
serious accidents are much the same as with murderers. This kind of
person is just as atypical as the murderer; indeed, he closely
resembles the murderer in attitudes and life history of singular
irresponsibility and indifference to human life and welfare.{186}
This similarity is marked in fatal gun accident perpetrators: as
compared to cars (which take 190 times as many lives{187}),
handguns are simple mechanisms that are entirely safe for any owner
who is responsible enough to observe elementary precautions.
Empirical studies show that "A gun becomes involved in a fatal
accident through misuse." -- for, unlike the average gun owner,
those "who cause such accidents are disproportionately involved in
other accidents, violent crime and heavy drinking."{188} Given
their background of serious felony, substance abuse, automobile and
other dangerous accidents, often irrational assaults on family,
etc. the question as to these reckless and/or irresponsible people
is not whether they will kill themselves or others, but when they
will eventually do so.{189} Indeed, a very large portion of child
gun accidents may be attributable to these people who are likely to
irresponsibly leave loaded guns unsecured.</p>

<p>It is a category error to apply to the general citizenry gun
accident fatality statistics that are actually accurate only for
idiosyncratic gun misusers.{190} But, once again, this highlights
the imperative for gun controls to forbid such misusers having
access not only to the relatively accident-free handgun but to any
kind of firearm. Feasible gun control proposals to deal with the
problem of accidental fatalities are offered below.</p>

<h1>CONTROL ALL GUNS, NOT JUST HANDGUNS</h1>

<p>Now I wish to address a crucial problem that is invariably
ignored by both pro- and anti-gun extremists alike: controls over
handguns but not rifles and shotguns, may result in the counter-
productive substitution of these weapons accident and assault
situations where long weapons are far more problematic. The gun
lobby has understandably not made this point despite its being the
single strongest argument against the National Coalition to Ban
Handguns. Naturally, the National RIFLE Association has no interest
in explaining that long guns are much more deadly and easy to
discharge accidentally because that only defuses demands for
banning handguns at the cost of justifying greater regulation for
all guns.</p>

<p>Anti-gun advocates and academics have failed to address long gun
substitution because they are mostly too ignorant -- proudly
ignorant -- of guns to even grasp the problem.{191} They are proud
to be ignorant because it validates their moral superiority over
the barbaric gun lovers they so despise. But, whatever the moral
value of their ignorance, it precludes their anti-gun proposals
being taken seriously. Indeed, it renders their proposals not just
useless but actually life-threatening because they might lead to
the substitution of long guns for handguns in accident and assault
situations.</p>

<h2>1. Handguns vs. long guns as accident vectors</h2>

<p>Anti-handgun advocates recognize that an effective handgun ban
would induce many people to substitute long guns for the purposes
handguns now serve. In a 1979 article National Coalition to Ban
Handguns (NCBH) chief spokesman, Samuel Fields Jr., argued a ban
would greatly reduce the "2500 handgun deaths" he asserted were
annually "associated with handgun accidents" in that</p>

<dl>
<dd>A strict permit system and/or a ban on private possession of
handguns would significantly alter the firearms habits of
law-abiding citizens, who would then turn to safer long guns for
self-protection. [Emphasis added.]{192}</dd>
</dl>

Academic proponents of these views include Dr. Diane H. Schetky in
two different issues of the AMERICAN JOURNAL OF DISEASES OF
CHILDREN.{193} Asserting that she wants handguns banned, not the
"taking away all firearms", she follows Fields in alleging as
examples of the terrible cost of handgun ownership that "Handguns
account for only 20% of the nation's firearms yet account for 90%
of all firearms use, both criminal and accidental."{194} 

<p>What is remarkable about such assertions is not just that their
every single assertion is wrong, but that their implicit (and in
Fields' case explicit) recommendation that long guns are "safer"
defensive weapons than handguns is tragically contrary to the
truth. The fact is that, for a host of technical reasons, long guns
are both far more susceptible to accidental discharge than handguns
and far more deadly when so discharged; and that is particularly
true for small children; toddlers cannot operate a handgun, but can
easily discharge a long gun their irresponsible parents keep loaded
and readily availably to them in the home.{195}</p>

<p>The crucial safety difference between handgun and long gun
clearly appears from an accurate statement of the accidental gun
death statistics which Mr. Fields and Dr. Shetky have so garbled
(to put the matter most charitably): Fields' claim of 2500 fatal
handgun accidents annually exaggerates by a factor of more than ten
the number of such fatalities that can be identified by the
National Safety Council (246 annually); indeed, Fields claim of
2,500 accidental deaths grossly overstates the average yearly total
for handguns and long guns combined (c. 1,850). As to the handgun,
its comparative safety advantage is demonstrated by the fact that
although it represents 90% or more of the guns kept loaded at any
one time, it can be identified as the weapon in less than 13.5% of
the fatal gun accidents.{196}</p>

<p>Fields may be forgiven his failure to offer such comparisons
(but not his misrepresenting the gun accident statistics as being
to the contrary), since when he wrote there were no national data
breaking down fatal gun accidents into handgun vs. long gun. But
such data had become available well before 1986 when Shetky wrote.
Regrettably she chose instead to cite something she calls "Federal
Bureau of Investigation, Uniform Crime Reports, Annual Crime
Surveys, 1963-73" (emphasis in original) as the source for her dual
claim that handguns: a) make up only 20% of the American gunstock,
but b) cause 90% of the fatal gun accidents. It is not surprising
that a) is 100% low and b) is 660% high;{197} after all, not only
does her alleged source not give those figures, the FBI does not
provide data on those subjects at all!{198}</p>

<h2>2. Handguns vs. long guns as criminal homicide vectors</h2>

<p>Academic anti-gun crusaders have pointed out that, since gun
wounds in general are much deadlier than knife wounds, banning all
guns would reduce murder because homicidal attackers would be
forced to substitute the less-deadly knife for guns.{199} True
enough, if it be assumed that banning all guns were feasible
politically (which it concededly is not) and that a ban would
disarm the kind of persons who use them feloniously (an issue the
anti-gun sagecraft literature has sedulously avoided treating).</p>

<p>But the same reasoning shows that banning handguns only is
likely to actually and grievously increase the death toll from
homicidal attack. Handguns are deadlier than large knives (which
kill only about 2.4% of those they wound); but rifles are between 5
and 11.4 times deadlier yet, i.e. c. 15 times deadlier than
knives.{200} Shotguns are so much deadlier yet that for medical
purposes the wounds they make are not to be "compared with other
bullet wounds... [A]t close range they are as deadly as a
cannon."{201}</p>

<p>Of course, unless sawed off, rifles and shotguns are less
concealable than are handguns. So it would not be reasonable to
assume that, if handguns disappeared, long guns would be used in
100% of the homicidal assaults now carried out with handguns. Some
homicidal attackers would substitute knives instead, with
presumably less lethal results. But, based on medical studies and
gross ballistic comparisons, I have estimated that if long guns
were substituted in only 50% of the assaults now carried out with
handguns the number actually killed would double. Note that that
catastrophic result would occur even if not one victim died in the
other 50% of the cases in which (hypothetically) knives would be
substituted!{202}</p>

<p>It cannot seriously be doubted that long guns (either sawed off
or unaltered) could be substituted in 50% of the assault that now
involve handguns. Criminological studies show "that anywhere from
54% to about 80% of homicides occur in circumstances that would
easily permit the use of a long gun".{203} This is more than
confirmed by the felons in the NIJ (National Institute of Justice)
felon survey: 82% of them concurred that "If a criminal wants a
handgun but can't get one he can always saw off a long gun."; and
87% of the felons who had often used handguns in crime felt that
sawing a long gun off to make it concealable for carrying would be
"easy" -- a view concurred in by 89% of those who had often used
shotguns.{204}</p>

<p>Based on these responses, Lizotte calculates that, far from
saving lives, the current handgun death toll might more than triple
if a handgun ban led to long gun substitution at the rates
indicated!{205} Perhaps the foregoing calculations are somehow
fundamentally wrong. But no such error has been exposed by anti-gun
academic crusaders. The sagecraft literature deals with the
possibility of long guns being substituted if handguns were banned
by just not mentioning it.</p>

<p>It bears emphasis that the danger of such substitution does not
at all preclude the possibility of intelligently tailored gun
controls. It simply dictates that controls be limited to ones that
are politically viable to impose on long guns and handguns equally
-- a possibility which, for obvious reasons, is never mentioned by
the National Rifle Association. But it is even more irresponsible
(and intellectually dishonest to boot) for anti-gun sages to
solemnly proclaim that banning handguns would save lives without
ever addressing the danger that it would result in far more lives
being lost. As the NIJ Evaluation facetiously remarks:</p>

<dl>
<dd>If someone intends to open fire on the authors of this study,
our strong preference is that they open fire with a handgun, and
the junkier the handgun, the better. The possibility that even a
fraction of the predators who now walk the streets armed with
handguns would, in the face of a handgun ban, prowl with sawed-off
shotguns instead causes one to tremble.{206}</dd>
</dl>

<h1>BASIC PRINCIPLES OF GUN CONTROL</h1>

<p>The basic regulatory principles may be grouped under the
concepts: Realism, Favorable Trade-Offs, Parity, Accomodation,
Avoiding Unfavorable Trade-Offs and Affirmative Benefits.</p>

<h2>Realism</h2>

<p>The first point under realism is that of the English analyst
Greenwood: no matter how stringent the controls, there will always
be enough guns in any society that anyone determined to have a gun
will be able to do so, whether for crime or self-defense. Thus,
after nearly 80 years of ever more stringently administered state
handgun ban, New York City police estimate the number of illegally
owned guns there at 2-3 million. Anti-gun crusaders attribute this
to the fact that handguns are legally obtained in most other
states. But even in peaceful England where very few people think it
urgent to have a gun for self-defense, Greenwood has shown that the
number of guns illegally smuggled in off-sets the number
confiscated yearly. In other words, 70 years of ever more strictly
administered ban has not even diminished the illegal gunstock.</p>

<p>Moreover, the more closely one looks, the more absurd it is to
blame the lack of a ban in other states for the failure of New
York's handgun ban. It turns out that the rate at which handguns
are (illegally) owned for defense in New York City is more than
double the rate of defensive ownership in the states where it is
legal. The fact is that, if people feel it is urgent to have a gun
for family defense they are going to get one, regardless of any
law. With upwards of 200 million guns in the U.S. (70 million of
them handguns), there is no hope of reducing crime by banning and
confiscating guns. Such a policy would actually reduce the cost of
new guns. Any machinist can manufacture basic revolvers and
automatic pistols out of pot metal to be sold more cheaply than
commercially made guns are now -- just as rotgut sold for less
during Prohibition than good liquor had before it. Of course, pot
metal guns would not safely fire more than 100-200 shots. But that
would far more than suffice to meet the demand for new and
additional guns for crime or self-defense purposes.</p>

<p>Gun policies ought not to be designed or adopted according to
unrealistic expectations. The inevitable failure only creates gun
lobby propaganda. The basic determinants of violent crime are
fundamental socio-cultural, institutional and economic factors that
no gun law can overcome. So long as perhaps 1 out of every 300
persons who grow up in the U.S. is inclined toward violent crime,
our society will be far more violent than either gun-banning
England or gun-loving Switzerland, where only 1 out of 30,000
inhabitants is so inclined.</p>

<h2>Favorable Trade-offs</h2>

<p>But that does not justify the gun lobby's myopic rejection of
all new controls. Gun controls can have net marginal value if
carefully tailored to produce value that exceeds the costs they
involve. For instance, burglars rarely carry guns. Doubtless the
primary reason for this is that burglars expect to avoid
confrontation by striking only when they think the premises are
unoccupied. But their eschewal of gun carrying is reinforced by the
knowledge that in most states they will face much stiffer
punishment if they are caught with a gun in a burglary.</p>

<p>If gun crimes are more to be feared overall, this is a law that
does some good and is virtually cost-free: if burglars obey it, we
are all better off; insofar as they are caught disobeying, the law
focusses imprisonment on those who are most dangerous and,
therefore, most desirable to incapacitate. The same point underlies
laws severely punishing ownership of any kind of gun by people who
have been convicted of felony. Of course, the most violent felons
(robbers, rapists, hit men) will be the least likely to obey; but
when they disobey, the law allows them to be incapacitated by long
imprisonment for just owning a gun -- without having to wait until
they actually hurt someone with it.</p>

<h2>Parity</h2>

<p>It is trite, but necessary, to emphasize that in evaluating gun
law strategies negative as well as positive effects must be
considered. The ineluctable fact is that control strategies that
produce long gun substitution for handguns in any substantial
proportion of problematic situations will greatly aggravate the
dangers of gun misuse. Thus any good control strategy involves
parity of regulation between long guns and handguns to avoid the
danger of promoting substitution of the former for the latter.
Concomitantly, if controls broad enough to provide such parity are
not now politically feasible, adoption of the strategy must wait
until parity becomes feasible.</p>

<h2>Accomodation</h2>

<p>Only with strong cooperation from owners can broader federal gun
controls be established. Absent such cooperation, to require a
license to own guns, for instance, would be, at best a dead letter,
at worst a source of enforcement costs that would vastly exceed any
possible benefit. Whether cooperation can be achieved, given the
decades of scorn, contempt and hatred that anti-gun extremists have
heaped upon gun owners, is very doubtful.</p>

<p>At a minimum, gun owners would need the reassurance of a U.S.
Supreme Court decision squarely recognizing that the Bill of Rights
gives every law abiding, responsible adult the freedom to choose to
own guns for the protection of home and family. Also, gun owners
would have to be convinced: that any proposed gun law is formulated
in recognition of their legitimate interests and represents an
honest attempt to accomodate those interests within the social
necessity of rational control over deadly instruments; and that the
law's administration would not be so hostile and/or arbitrary as to
deny law-abiding, responsible adults the freedom to choose to own
guns for home and family defense.</p>

<h2>Avoid Unfavorable Trade-Offs</h2>

<p>Some anti-gun crusaders have their own, predictably onerous
proposal for avoiding the need for any accomodation. Their plan is
for Congress to ban handguns and command their confiscation by a
law imposing a mandatory mimimum year prison sentence on every
violator. Much the same proposal was made to the New York State
Legislature in 1980. It was tabled when the Prison Commissioner
testified that the state prison system would collapse if just 1% of
the illegal handgun owners in New York City (where ordinary
citizens cannot get a permit) were caught, tried and
imprisoned.</p>

<p>So also would the federal prison system collapse if it tried to
house even 100th of 1% of the tens of millions who would not obey a
federal handgun ban. Fortunately, they would not get to prison
because the federal court system would collapse under the burden of
trying them.</p>

<h2>Affirmative Benefit</h2>

<p>Widespread ownership of handguns for defense of self, home or
family is only natural in a nation beset with endemic crime. The
empirical evidence establishes that such victim gun ownership
results in the interruption and frustration of c. 645,000 crimes
each year. (Another 280,000 handgun uses yearly are for defense
against poisonous snakes, rabid squirrels, foxes, etc.) Civilian
handgun ownership averts thousands of victim injuries, and even
deaths, which would not otherwise have been avoidable, given the
manifest physical and tactical advantages criminals have over
unarmed victims.</p>

<p>Against these palpable benefits there are no substantial costs
of gun ownership by law-abiding, responsible adults. Such ownership
may marginally increase the number of gun accidents. But the vast
majority of these stem from gun misuse by the same aberrant group
of reckless and/or violent people who perpetrate the vast majority
of murders. Applying these irresponsible gun misusers' accident and
murder rates to gun possession by the average citizen makes no more
sense that estimating that citizen's chance of dying from a cut
based on death rates among hemophiliacs.</p>

<h1>SOME RATIONAL GUN CONTROL PROPOSALS</h1>

<p>The following are some ways of fine-tuning current gun laws:</p>

<p>1) Current federal law (and a potpourri of state laws) forbid
gun ownership by convicted felons and persons adjudged of unsound
mind. This could be extended to embrace anyone convicted of driving
while intoxicated or of multiple conviction of selected violent
misdemeanors. Such laws should be leavened by allowing police to
give special permits to own a gun to such people if they have not
been in trouble for years.</p>

<p>2) The ban on felons owning guns is undercut because millions of
sales are between private persons where the sellers have no way of
checking whether the buyer is a felon. The obvious way to deal with
this would be to require everyone who owns or wants to buy a gun to
acquire a federal permit that would be available on proof that
he/she was an adult without a felony record. But that is both
politically and practically impossible. Gun owners, who are
convinced that the anti-gun crusaders will eventually use permit
records to confiscate all guns, would hysterically fight the law
and, if it were enacted, would flout it en masse. More promising
would be to have a criminal records check done with the driver's
license. Every license issued would bear the notation "eligible to
own firearms" (except, of course, for juveniles, felons and those
with sanity records). Sale of a gun to a person without a driver's
license bearing this notation would be a felony and also make the
seller financially liable for any wrong the buyer did with the
gun.</p>

<p>3) Guns commonly enter the underworld when stolen from lawful
owners by burglars who find such theft profitable because guns are
easily fencible items. One way to severely discourage such theft
would be a dual law that (a) imposes a mandatory three year prison
sentence on anyone knowingly possessing a stolen gun; and (b)
rebuttably presumes knowing possession if the defendant is found to
have possessed two or more stolen guns. Faced with this, fences may
stop buying stolen guns, thereby discouraging burglars from
stealing them.</p>

<p>4) The potpourri of state laws governing gun ownership by minors
should be strengthened by a uniform provision against possession of
any kind of gun by any person under 18 years of age, except under
the supervision of a parent or other responsible adult.</p>

<p>5) It should be a felony for a parent to negligently allow a gun
of any kind to fall into the hands of an unsupervised minor. Where
the parent himself owns the gun illegally (e.g. because he is a
convicted felon), there should be mandatory imprisonment for at
least 5 years. The gun lobby has objected that a parent whose child
has been killed in a gun accident should not be subjected to the
additional penalty of a prison sentence. But people who are
unwilling to obey current gun laws and too irresponsible to protect
childen against the consequences are too dangerous to be allowed at
liberty, independent of any issue of punishment.</p>

<p>6) The current potpourri of state laws on carrying a gun are
inconsistent, irrational and so maladministered that permits to
carry are granted to unqualified persons with special influence and
arbitrarily denied to uninfluential persons, however well
qualified.{207} They should be replaced by a comprehensive
prohibition against carrying a loaded gun of any kind (whether
concealed or openly) without a permit which would be issued as a
matter of right, but only to persons demonstrating firearms skill
and legal knowledge as to their use comparable to that required of
a police officer in the jurisdiction.</p>

<p>7) In addition, it should be illegal to carry a loaded gun on
the person, if inebriated (a prohibition that would apply even in
one's own home), or while drinking in a bar. .</p>

<h1>CONCLUSION: FUTILITY OF LAW REFORM WHEN THE SYSTEM IS AT
OVERLOAD</h1>

<p>Please do not misconstrue the foregoing law reform proposals to
suggest that fine-tuning gun laws is the key to curbing even gun
crime, much less violence in general. The U.S. already has some
20,000 federal, state and local gun laws which cover almost every
approach to achieving even the inherently limited benefits gun
control offer by way of reducing crime. Though I have offered
suggestions for fine-tuning those laws, the real problem lies not
in the scope or precise provisions of current controls, but in the
lack of consistent enforcement and resources for enforcement. The
premier study of gun law enforcement concludes:</p>

<dl>
<dd>It is very possible that, if gun laws do potentially reduce
gun-related crime, the present laws are all that is needed if they
are enforced. What good would stronger laws do when the court have
demonstrated that they will not enforce them?{208}</dd>
</dl>

Though depressingly accurate as to the lack of enforcement, this
actually understates the problem and is unjust in blaming the
courts exclusively. In areas plagued by violence, prosecutors and
courts are at overload with cases of heinous crime, and many state
prisons are literally overflowing with the perpetrators. A system
overburdened with heinous violence cases is not going to give the
proper attention to felons who did nothing more heinous than
carrying a gun. Yet this inability to suitably incarcerate negates
the whole purpose of the gun law which is to help prevent dangerous
crimes before they occur. The lack of resources needed to prosecute
and incapacitate by long incarceration felons who are caught with
guns before they commit heinous crimes, destroys gun controls'
potential for preventing those crimes. 

<p>The justice system's near-terminal overload makes irrelevant any
merits which might exist in the gun law proposals offered by both
pro- and anti-gun extremists. For instance, the gun lobby proposes
to stop gun crime by highly publicized mandatory penalty laws: when
a crime involves a gun, judges would be required by the Legislature
to impose a minimum 5 year sentence. Gun crime has fallen in some
states that so legislated -- until it became clear that courts were
systematically sabotaging it by imposing the 5 year mandatory
sentence concurrently with, rather than consecutively from, the 5
years an armed robber would already receive.</p>

<p>It is easy to join Bendis &amp; Balkin in castigating the courts
for this. But it is all too simplistic. Prosecutors are no less at
fault for cooperating with the judges in plea bargains entered into
with the understanding that the sentence would be concurrent rather
than consecutive. The blame really belongs on legislatures for
credulously accepting a"quick fix" approach of burdening an already
terminally overburdened system without adding concomitant
resources. Any mandatory sentencing requires massive infusion of
additional resources: for, if a long sentence is certain, and no
plea bargain possible, felons have every reason to add another
protracted jury trial to those already inundating the prosecutor
and court. Moroever, judges and prosecutors know that the result,
when prisons are already overflowing, of mandated sentences for
offenders who rob at gunpoint means less time served by even more
dangerous and malignant offenders (for instance, the rapists who
gratuitously mutilated victims with a knife). When reason and
institutional pressures unite against sentencing offenders severely
just because they used a gun, it is unlikely to occur by
legislative fiat, absent vastly expanded prosecutorial, judicial
and prison resources.</p>

<p>The problems of terminal systemic overload equally doom the
anti-gun program. As noted earlier, the most specific proposals for
banning and confiscating all guns (or even just handguns) also
depends on mandatory sentencing: a mandatory year term for anyone
found with a gun, be he good citizen or felon. Forget about the
felons, either for gun crimes or crimes of any kind. To seriously
enforce this law against the often fanatic owners of 70 million
handguns would far exceed the combind capacity of all the courts in
the U.S. combined, even if they stopped processing all other
criminal and civil cases to try only gun cases.</p>

<p>Less extreme anti-gun proposals are only less unrealistic.
Consider the anti-gun claim that a waiting period, during which
their criminal records were checked, would have prevented John
Hinckley from buying the gun with which he shot President Reagan
and Patrick Purdy from buying the gun with which he massacred the
children in Stockton. Regretably, that is simply false -- though it
ought to be true!</p>

<p>During the 1980 campaign, Hinckley, who was then stalking
President Carter, was caught committing the state felony of
carrying a concealed handgun and the federal one of trying to take
it on an airliner. Neither charge was pressed "in the interest of
justice"; i.e. the interest of prosecutors in focussing on their
current overload of serious violent crime cases rather than on
people who have not (yet) committed such a crime. The promise of
gun laws is epitomized by the fact that, if he had been convicted
and sentenced under those laws, Hinckley would not have been at
liberty to shoot Reagan a year later. The frustration of that
promise by systemic overload is epitomized by the fact that, even
if a waiting period/felony conviction check law existed, it would
not have prevented Hinckley from buying his new gun. He had no
felony conviction record to be checked! The same is true of Purdy:
he had been arrested for a succession of felonies over several
years, but all had been plea bargained down to misdemeanors.</p>

<p>The affirmative social benefit of widespread gun ownership is
that handguns alone are used by good citizens to repel about
645,000 crimes annually. (Another c. 210,000 defensive handgun uses
annually involve dangerous animals, e.g. rabid skunks. If long guns
are included, guns are used to repel about 1 million crimes per
year.) The downside of widespread gun availability among the law-
abiding is that there will always be some leakage to criminals when
guns are stolen in burglaries. Realistically, however, we must
recognize that there will always be enough guns in society to
supply the needs of criminals or terrorists.</p>

<p>Moreover we could substantially reduce gun crime by simply
enforcing our present laws. If the resources were committed to
convict and incarcerate every felon caught illegally possessing a
gun, many dangerous felons would be incapacitated and others would
learn to eschew guns. But we as a society are not willing to commit
the billions of dollars that would be required.</p>

<p>It is trite and, more important, untrue to characterize the gun
crime (and violent crime in general) as problems to which there are
merely "no easy solutions." These are problems to which there are
no good solutions at all -- only painful compromises. Much of the
support for banning guns comes from people who cannot accept this.
But, to paraphrase Bendis &amp; Balkin, if we are not willing to
mobilize the resources necessary to enforce current gun laws, what
is the point of discussing the herculean effort that would be
required to confiscate 200 million guns (or 70 million handguns)
and incarcerate their 98% non-criminal owners?</p>

ago:</p>

<li>As to the aberrance of homicide perpetrators, see the section
of this paper devoted to that issue. The estimate of handgun owner-
murderers is Prof. Gary Kleck's and derives from a comparison of
handgun homicide data to the number of respondents to the 1987 GSS
Survey answering that they personally owned a gun. 

<p>These estimates probably grossly over-estimate the number of
legal handgun owners who murder. After all, illegal gun owners (a
group that composes a very substantial proportion of murderers) are
disproportionately unlikely either to be asked to respond to a GSS
Survey or to incriminate themselves by honestly answering that they
own a gun. Prof. Kleck was kind enough to give me this set of
estimates as a personal communication. It will eventually appear in
an as yet untitled book he is preparing for Aldine de Guyter Press

Prohibition and Social Necessity", 23 ST.L.U.L.J. 23, 51 (1979)
(emphasis added). In fact, long guns are actually both far more
dangerous when discharged and, for various technical reasons, far
more subject to accident. See discussion below. Thus the effect if
a handgun ban caused long gun substitution would be to
geometrically increase accidental gun fatalities. See discussion in
the section on gun accidents below.</li>

<li>While taking elephant, rhinoceros and similar animals requires
express rifles of .40 caliber or more .30 caliber non-express
weapons suffice for any North American game animal. Not
coincidentally, American manufacturers do not make express rifles
and .30 caliber rifles are the largest that would ever be owned by
Americans, excepting the tiny minority of African big game hunters.
Likewise, barrel length of rifles and shotguns is a function of the
area in which they are expected to be used: long barrelled guns
tend are owned by those who hunt in open country where long range
accuracy is optimum; short barrelled guns are used in heavy brush
country where long barrels tend to snag when brought into action as

preserved against their own government, their own fellow
countrymen, someday ...".; and Williams and McGrath, "Why People

<li>NIJ Evaluation at 120ff. It should be noted that the
differences in fear level are not overwhelming and that the fear
differential in one of the studies may be an artifact of its
omitting women gun owners from the comparison. See the critique of
DeFronzo, "Fear of Crime and Handgun Ownership", 17 CRIMINOLOGY 331
(1979) in Hill, Howell &amp; Driver, "Gender, Fear and Protective
Gun Ownership" 23 CRIMINOLOGY 541 (1985). But see the finding that
women gun owners are less afraid than non-owners in Thompson,

<li>Huston, Geis &amp; Wright, "The Angry Samaritans", PSYCHOLOGY
TODAY, June 1976. The percentage of the general public who owned
guns derives from Kleck-Aldine above, ch. 2, from separate
percentages of black and white gun owners given in Erskine, "The
Polls: Gun Control" 36 PUBLIC OPINION Q. 455, 459 (1972) on the
assumption that 90% of the sample was white and 10% black.</li>

is macho.").</li>

<li>Young, "Perceptions of Crime, Racial Attitudes and Firearms
Ownership", 64 SOCIAL FORCES 473 (1985). Kleck-Aldine above, ch. 2
criticizes this conclusion because the data cited did not exclude
the alternative possibility that the racist attitudes correlated
not with gun ownership per se but with the political conservatism
of the particular set of gun owners responding to the survey.</li>

<li>For state data please see Lizotte, Bordua and White, "Firearms
Ownership for Sport and Protection: Two Not So Divergent Models",

<li>As exemplified by the examples given in the text I use the
terms "husband", "wife", "mate" and "spousal" to include not only
actual, on-going and legal marriages, but also "common law"
marriage (which is legal in some states, but not others) and
"boyfriend-girlfriend", as well as estranged and former versions of
all these relationships.</li>

<li>All discussion of gun-armed self-defense in this paper is
directed to handguns because they are infinitely more efficacious
for defense than rifles or shotguns. In contrast to the unwieldy
long gun, the short barrelled handgun is much easier to bring into
play at close quarters and much harder for an assailant to wrest
away. Consider the situation of a woman holding an intruder at bay
while trying to dial the police. With a rifle, this is difficult
and hazardous at best. Given only the two inch barrel of a snub-
nosed handgun to grasp, not even the strongest man can lever it
from a woman's grip before she shoots him. M. Ayoob, THE TRUTH
ABOUT SELF-PROTECTION (N.Y., Bantam: 1983) 332-3, 341-2,
345-55.</li>

<li>Thus Ramsey Clark denounces precautionary gun ownership as an
atavistic insult to American government: "A state in which a
citizen needs a gun to protect himself from crime has failed to
perform its first purpose."; it is "anarchy, not order under law --
a jungle where each relies on himself for survival." R. Clark,

<dd>The ability of the state to protect us from personal violence
is limited by resources and personnel shortages [in addition to
which] the state is usually unable to know that we need protection
until it is too late. By the time that the police can be notified
and then arrive at the scene the violent criminal has ample
opportunity to do serious harm. I once waited 20 minutes for the
New York City Police to respond to an "officer needs assistance"
call which has their highest priority. On the other hand, a gun
provides immediate protection. Even where the police are prompt and
efficient, the gun is speedier.</dd>

OF HOMICIDE (N.Y., Columbia, 1982). 

<p>It must be noted, however, that not all female defensive
killings of husbands are legal. The legality depends on whether the
wife reasonably anticipated that the husband's beating would cause
her death or great bodily harm. Even where the statutes classify
wife beating as a felony her proper resort is to seek prosecution;
absent imminent danger of death or great bodily harm, she must
submit to beating rather than resist with deadly force. People v
Jones, 191 C.A.2d 478 (Cal. Ct. of Ap., 1961); see generally Kates
and Engberg, "Deadly Force Self Defense Against Rape" 15 U.C.-DAVIS
L. REV. 873, 876-7 (1982). When a wife kills only after surviving
numerous prior beatings it may be particularly difficult to
convince police or jury that she reasonably believed this time was
different -- even though the pattern of men who eventually kill
their wives is generally one of progressively more severe beatings
until the final one. Howard, above.</p>

Compare Zimring &amp; Hawkins-1987 at p. 31 (emphasis added): "it

<li>This is particularly true against a handgun whose short barrel
makes it both much harder to wrest away than a long gun and much
easier to bring into play at close quarters. See note above.</li>

<li>For instance, although less than 10% of burglars carry guns,
Riley conceptualizes what will ensue if householders with guns
confront burglars in terms of "'bedroom shootouts' [which will be]
won by alert desperadoes with drawn guns rather than the usually

taking a measure of self-protection" rather than submitting), 14
("running away or reasoning with the offender... are less likely to
result in injury to the victim."), p. 19 ("those taking a self-
protective measure accounted for 58% of the emergency room
treatments and their injuries were twice as serious, judged by the
mean days of hospitalization") and again on p. 19 (of victims
hospitalized after rape, mugging or assault, compared to non-
resisters, "the seriousness of injury was five times as great for
those using a weapon for self-protection"), p. 30 (injuries in
aggravated assault are "more likely to be serious if the victim
physically resists the offender.").</li>

<li>A point that the pamphlet never makes -- but which emerges
quite forcefully from neutral evaluations of the evidence -- is
that submission does not assure that the victim will escape injury
or death. Felons may injure victims at the outset to assure
compliance with their demands and foreclose resistance or may
injure or execute them gratuitously. See. e.g. Cook, "The
Relationship Between Victim Resistance and Injury in Non-Commercial
Robbery", 15 J. LEGAL STUD. 405, 406 (1986).</li>

<li>To avoid confusion, it should be noted: that Handgun Control,
Inc., currently the most important organization in the anti-gun
lobby, has no direct link to the Handgun Control Staff, a non-
lobbying "research" organization that fell into desuetude in the
1970s; and that Professors Zimring and Hawkins are academic gun
control advocates with no direct link to either organization. The
"give them what they want" language is from GUNS DON'T DIE, PEOPLE
DO by Handgun Control Inc. Chairman Shields (pp. 124-5) which
relies heavily on the Handgun Control Staff's research. Zimring,
Hawkins and Newton take the same position; see also Riley,
"Shooting to Kill the Handgun: Time to Martyr Another American
'Hero'", 51 J. URBAN LAW 491, 497-8 (1972).</li>

<li>Zimring &amp; Hawkins-1987 above at 15. Curiously they make
this point in discussing how guns aid weaker people to victimize
stronger ones -- a crime pattern that is comparatively rare, to say
the very least. The point is unaccountably missing from their later
chapter on "Guns for Self Defense" to which it is far more
relevant.</li>

<li>Their views have been strongly criticized by a female

<li>A recent U.S Department of Justice study concludes that, over
their lifetimes, 83% of American children now aged 12 will be
victims of some kind of violent felony, and 52% of them will suffer
two or more such offenses, while 87% will have property stolen on 3
or more occasions; in all these crime categories blacks will be
much more frequently victimized than whites. N.Y. TIMES, March 9,
1987 n. above 13. Compare Sherman, "Free Police from the Shackles
of 911", WALL STREET JOURNAL, March 20, 1987: Minneapolis police
records show that in 1986 "23% of all the robberies, 15% of all the
rapes and 19% of all the assaults and disturbances" occurred
repetitively at only .3% of the city's commercial and residential
addresses; "a mere 5% of all the addresses ... produced 64% of all
the calls for police service." Needless to say, it is unlikely that
any of those who have to live or work at those repetitive
victimization addresses are white male academics.</li>

<li>Likewise studies of geographical areas within the U.S. should
show those with higher gun ownership having more murder. Yet the
consistent result of studies attempting to link gun ownership to
violence rates is either no relationship or a negative one, i.e.
that urban and other areas with higher gun ownership have less
violence than demographically comparable areas with lower gun
ownership. See, e.g. Murray, "Handguns, Gun Control Law and Firearm

<p>The anti-self-defense basis of Anglo-American gun control theory
is so unique that it produces profound differences not only in
policy and administration from those prevailing in other countries
but also in understanding superficially similar gun laws. One such
deceptive similarity is that the laws in New York City, England,
Switzerland and Israel all require a permit to own a handgun.
Indicative of the profound differences between those requirement is
that: permit issuance for the purpose of personal defense is
routine in Israel and Switzerland, administratively discouraged by
New York City and non-existent in England. In 1984 an attack on a
Jerusalem cafe by three terrorists armed with automatic weapons was
terminated when handgun-carrying Israeli civilians shot them down.
THE ECONOMIST, Ap. 7, 1984, p. 34.</p>

<p>Equally significant are differences in policy re civilian
possession of automatic weapons. Either an ordinary rifle or an
assault rifle or other fully automatic weapon requires a permit in
England; since 1934 possession of a fully automatic weapon in the
United States has required registration and been subject to a
prohibitive tax and as of 1986 purchasing new assault rifles or
other fully automatic weapons is totally forbidden in the United
States. But in Switzerland and Israel the government distributes
automatic weapons to the general population by the millions. I was
once asked by a puzzled Israeli why Americans think they have to
personally own guns: "if they have to live or be in dangerous areas
why don't they just check a handgun or submachine gun out of the
police armory?" The idea that American law would seek to prevent
law-abiding citizens threatened by violence from arming themselves
had never occurred to him and, on explanation proved
incomprehensible.</p>

which from earliest times had the highest murder rates, gun law
experimentation included: the only state law that completely banned
handgun sales (S.C., 1902; repealed 1966); the earliest bans on
"Saturday Night Specials" (Tennessee, 1870; Arkansas, 1881;
Alabama, 1893; Texas, 1907; Virginia, 1925); the earliest

handgun (N.C. 1917; Missouri, 1919; Arkansas, 1923).</li>

<li>Greenwood, Morn, above.</li>

<li>Monckkonen, "Diverging Homicide Rates: England and the United
States" in T. Gurr, VIOLENCE IN AMERICA v. 1 at 81 (1989). He
rejects gun ownership as a reason for the homicide differential
citing a point that it made below in greater detail: even those who
see guns as the reason do not contend that their removal could
reduce American homicide by more than 50%; yet if American homicide
were reduced by 50%, its rate would still be 500% greater than the
British rate.</li>

<li>Naturally, anti-gun academic crusaders do not credit the
availability of guns in the U.S. for its relative lack of political
violence. They (quite correctly) attribute that to socio-cultural
and institutional differences between the U.S. and Europe. Yet it
does not occur to the anti-gun academic crusaders to attribute
international crime differentials to socio-cultural and
institutional differences rather than differential gun
ownership.</li>

handguns were involved in c. 8,275 murders (45% of all murders), a
27% decline in handgun homicide. Homicide by all means had declined
almost 10%. In the 20 year period 1966-1985 murders with guns
declined from 64.8% of the total murder rate to 58.7%.</li>

<li>This was denied by anti-gun advocate Mike Royko in a facetious
column that appeared shortly after the Post Office massacre. Royko
derisively claimed that, given Oklahoma's "weak" gun laws, the
gunman should have been shot down by his victims if gun armed self
defense really works. But regardless of state law, the federal Gun
Control Act of 1968 prohibits possession of a gun in a federal
building. Perhaps this policy is cost-beneficial overall. But in
the massacre situation its cost was that the only armed person in
the Post Office was the killer who was not deterred by the prospect
of having to violate the law.</li>

<li>To analyze enforceability requires analyzing two sub-issues:
the likelihood of voluntary compliance; and the ease with which a
handgun ban can be enforced against the non-compliant. As to the
first sub-issue, massive resistance can be expected since people
believe (whether rightly or not is irrelevant) that they urgently
need a handgun for their family's defense and that a handgun ban
would itself be illegal as against the constitutional right to
arms. In contrast, no one but alcoholics "need" liquor and
Prohibition was clearly legal, having been enacted as a
constitutional amendment. As to enforcement against the non-
compliant, liquor is consumed by use so continuing to use it
required violators to take relatively high viability step to buy
more liquor. In contrast, it would require unconstitutional house-
to-house searches to find and confiscate the upwards of 70 million
extant handguns. For those who do not already own one buying it
requires only a single purchase -- and if handguns were smuggled in
at the rate at which marijuana is estimated to be, 20 million new
handguns would be available for purchase each year. See discussion
in "Handgun Banning and the Prohibition Experience", id at

1,806. This averages out to 1950. (The lower average I give in the
text reflects the c. 1825 accidental gun fatalities per year in the
years since.) 

<p>The estimate that handguns comprise c. 90% of the loaded guns at
any time comes from raw data in Bordua's survey research among
Illinois gun owners; see also 82 MICH. LAW REV. above at 263. As to
the number of fatal handgun accidents annually, the National Safety
Council only began breaking out a separate figure in 1979. In that
and the successive years there were an average of 246 identifiable
accidental handgun deaths out of an average 1825 fatal gun
accidents overall. Although the number of long gun fatalities is
clearly substantially higher, this 246 figure may understate the
phenomenon since in many accidental gun fatalities it is
undetermined whether the weapon was handgun or a long gun. See
Kleck-Aldine, ch. 7 ("Firearms Accidents") above.</p>
</li>

<li>As to (b) the correct figure is 13.5% not 90% (see last
footnote) and as to (a) it is c. 40% not 20%. See NIJ Evaluation,
Table 2-5 at p. 42, and preceding comment (p. 41) that "Although
there is much disagreement in the literature over the total number
of [guns], there is a fair consensus over the relative proportions"
of handguns vs. long guns.</li>

<li>As suggested by my quotation marks, the purported FBI
publication she cites does not appear to exist. Giving her the
benefit of the doubt, I assume what she is citing, as if they were
one document, are the annual Uniform Crime Reports issued by FBI
for each of the years 1963-73. But these Reports give data on law
enforcement and crime only. They do not -- nor does the FBI at all
-- compile figures for accidents (with guns or otherwise) or for
gun ownership in general; nor does the FBI provide comparative
breakdowns for handgun vs. long gun accidents nor for handgun vs.
long gun ownership. 

<p>Nor should readers be misled by the fact that the Uniform Crime
Reports deal with crime into crediting Dr. Shetsky's claim that
they show handguns account for "90% of all firearms misuse, both
criminal and accidental" (my emphasis). No such figure is given in
the Uniform Crime Reports cited; in fact those Reports did not
regularly breakdown any category of gun crime into long vs.
handgun. Some (but not all) of those Reports did so breakdown gun
homicides and the 1967 Report gave such a breakdown for gun robbery
and aggravated assault as well. But neither altogether nor
separately do the figures cited in any of the cited Reports
correspond to those given by Dr. Shetsky. The facts are both that
available data on this subject are insufficient to support the kind
of estimate she is making -- and that they clearly do not support
her figure. See discussion in ch. 9 of the NIJ Evaluation.</p>
