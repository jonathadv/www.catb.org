Life</strong></div>

<blockquote><em><q>The bearing of arms is the essential medium
through which the individual asserts both his social power and his
participation in politics as a responsible moral being...</q>
(Historian J.G.A. Pocock, describing the beliefs of the founders of
the U.S.)</em></blockquote>

<p>There is nothing like having your finger on the trigger of a gun
to reveal who you really are. Life or death in one twitch &mdash;
ultimate decision, with the ultimate price for carelessness or bad
choices.</p>

<p>It is a kind of acid test, an initiation, to know that there is
lethal force in your hand and all the complexities and ambiguities
of moral choice have fined down to a single action: fire or
not?</p>

<p>In truth, we are called upon to make life-or-death choices more
often than we generally realize. Every political choice ultimately
reduces to a choice about when and how to use lethal force, because
the threat of lethal force is what makes politics and law more than
a game out of which anyone could opt at any time.</p>

<p>But most of our life-and-death choices are abstract; their costs
are diffused and distant. We are insulated from those costs by
layers of institutions we have created to specialize in controlled
violence (police, prisons, armies) and to direct that violence
(legislatures, courts). As such, the lessons those choices teach
seldom become personal to most of us.</p>

<p>Nothing most of us will ever do combines the moral weight of
life-or-death choice with the concrete immediacy of the moment as
thoroughly as the conscious handling of instruments deliberately
designed to kill. As such, there are lessons both merciless and
priceless to be learned from bearing arms &mdash; lessons which are not
merely instructive to the intellect but transformative of one's
whole emotional, reflexive, and moral character.</p>

<p>The first and most important of these lessons is this:
<strong>it all comes down to you</strong>.</p>

<p>No one's finger is on the trigger but your own. All the
talk-talk in your head, all the emotions in your heart, all the
experiences of your past &mdash; these things may inform your choice,
but they can't move your finger. All the socialization and
rationalization and justification in the world, all the approval or
disapproval of your neighbors &mdash; none of these things can pull the
trigger either. They can change how you feel about the choice, but
only you can actually <em>make</em> the choice. Only you. Only
here. Only now. Fire, or not?</p>

<p>A second is this: <strong>never count on being able to undo your
choices</strong>.</p>

<p>If you shoot someone through the heart, dead is dead. You can't
take it back. There are no do-overs. Real choice is like that; you
make it, you live with it &mdash; or die with it.</p>

<p>A third lesson is this: <strong>the universe doesn't care about
motives</strong>.</p>

<p>If your gun has an accidental discharge while pointed an unsafe
direction, the bullet will kill just as dead as if you had been
aiming the shot. <q>I didn't mean to</q> may persuade others that you
are less likely to repeat a behavior, but it won't bring a corpse
back to life.</p>

<p>These are hard lessons, but necessary ones. Stated, in print,
they may seem trivial or obvious. But ethical maturity consists, in
significant part, of knowing these things &mdash; not merely at the
level of intellect but at the level of emotion, experience and
reflex. And nothing <em>teaches</em> these things like repeated
confrontation with life-or-death choices in grave knowledge of the
consequences of failure.</p>

<p>This psychological insight both illuminates and is reinforced by
one central fact of U.S. history that is usually considered purely
political, and even (wrongly) thought to be of interest only to
Americans.</p>

<p>The Founding Fathers of the United States believed, and wrote,
that the bearing of arms was essential to the character and dignity
of a free people. For this reason, they wrote a Second Amendment in
the Bill Of Rights which reads <q>the right to bear arms shall not
be infringed</q>.</p>

<p>Whether one agrees or disagrees with it, the Second Amendment is
usually interpreted in these latter days as an axiom of and about
<em>political</em> character &mdash; an expression of republican
political thought, a prescription for a equilibrium of power in
which the armed people are at least equal in might to the organized
forces of government.</p>

<p>It is all these things. But it is something more, because the
Founders regarded political character and individual ethical
character as inseparable. They had a clear notion of the individual
virtues necessary collectively to a free people. They did not
merely regard the habit of bearing arms as a <em>political</em>
virtue, but as a direct promoter of <em>personal</em> virtue.</p>

<p>The Founders had been successful armed revolutionaries. Every
one of them had had repeated confrontation with life-or-death
choices, in grave knowledge of the consequences of failure. They
desired that the people of their infant nation should always
cultivate that kind of ethical maturity, the keen sense of
individual moral responsibility that they had personally learned
from using lethal force in defense of their liberty.</p>

<p>Accordingly, firearms were prohibited only to those intended to be
kept powerless and infantilized. American gun prohibitions have their
origins in racist legislation designed to disarm slaves and black
freedmen. The wording of that legislation repays study; it was
designed not merely to deny blacks the political power of arms but to
prevent them from <em>aspiring to the dignity of free men</em>.</p>

<p>The dignity of free men (and, as we would properly add today,
free women). That is a phrase that bears thinking on. As the
twentieth century draws to a close, it sounds archaic. Our
discourse has nearly lost the concept that the health of the
<em>res publica</em> is founded on private virtue. Too many of us
contemplate a president who preaches <q>family values</q> and
<q>responsibility</q> to the nation while committing adultery and
perjury, and don't see a contradiction.</p>

<p>But Thomas Jefferson's question, posed in his inaugural address
of 1801, still stings. If a man cannot be trusted with the
government of himself, how can he be trusted with the government of
others? And this is where history and politics circle back to
ethics and psychology: because <q>the dignity of a free (wo)man</q>
consists in being competent to govern one's self, and in
<em>knowing</em>, down to the core of one's self, that one is so
competent.</p>

<p>And <em>that</em> is where ethics and psychology bring us back
to the bearing of arms. For causality runs both ways here; the
dignity of a free man is what makes one ethically competent to bear
arms, and the act of bearing arms promotes (by teaching its hard
and subtle lessons) the inner qualities that compose the dignity of
a free man.</p>

<p>It is not always so, of course. There is a 3% or so of
psychotics, drug addicts, and criminal deviants who are incapable
of the dignity of free men. Arms in the hands of such as these do
not promote virtue, but are merely instruments of tragedy and
destruction. But so, too, are cars. And kitchen knives. And bricks.
The ethically incompetent readily (and effectively) find other
means to destroy and terrorize when denied arms. And when civilian
arms are banned, they more readily find helpless victims.</p>

<p>But for the other 97%, the bearing of arms functions not merely
as an assertion of power but as a fierce and redemptive discipline.
When sudden death hangs inches from your right hand, you become
much more careful, more mindful, and much more peaceful in your
heart &mdash; because you know that if you are thoughtless or sloppy in
your actions or succumb to bad temper, people will
<em>die</em>.</p>

<p>Too many of us have come to believe ourselves incapable of this
discipline. We fall prey to the sick belief that we are all
psychopaths or incompetents under the skin. We have been taught to
imagine ourselves armed only as villains, doomed to succumb to our
own worst nature and kill a loved one in a moment of carelessness
or rage. Or to end our days holed up in a mall listening to police
bullhorns as some SWAT sniper draws a bead...</p>

<p>But it's not so. To believe this is to ignore the actual
statistics and generative patterns of weapons crimes. <q>Virtually
never</q>, writes criminologist Don B. Kates, <q>are murderers the
ordinary, law-abiding people against whom gun bans are aimed.
Almost without exception, murderers are extreme aberrants with
lifelong histories of crime, substance abuse, psychopathology,
mental retardation and/or irrational violence against those around
them, as well as other hazardous behavior, e.g., automobile and gun
accidents.</q></p>

<p>To believe one is incompetent to bear arms is, therefore, to
live in corroding and almost always needless fear of the self &mdash; in
fact, to affirm oneself a moral coward. A state further from <q>the
dignity of a free man</q> would be rather hard to imagine. It is as a
way of exorcising this demon, of <em>reclaiming</em> for ourselves
the dignity and courage and ethical self-confidence of free (wo)men
that the bearing of personal arms, is, ultimately, most
important.</p>

<p>This is the final ethical lesson of bearing arms: <strong>that
right choices are possible, and the ordinary judgement of ordinary
(wo)men is sufficient to make them</strong>.</p>

<p>We can, truly, embrace our power and our responsibility to make
life-or-death decisions, rather than fearing both. We <em>can</em>
accept our ultimate responsibility for our own actions. We can know
(not just intellectually, but in the sinew of experience) that we
<em>are</em> fit to choose.</p>

<p>And not only <em>can</em> we &mdash; we <em>must</em>. The Founding
Fathers of the United States understood why. If we fail this test,
we fail not only in private virtue but consequently in our capacity
to make public choices. Rudderless, lacking an earned and grounded
faith in ourselves, we can only drift &mdash; increasingly helpless to
summon even the <em>will</em> to resist predators and tyrants (let
alone the <em>capability</em> to do so).</p>

<p>Joel Barlow, a political theorist of Jefferson's time, wrote
tellingly: <q>[The disarming of citizens has] a double effect, it
palsies the hand and brutalizes the mind: a habitual disuse of
physical forces totally destroys the moral [force]; and men lose at
once the power of protecting themselves, and of discerning the
cause of their oppression.</q></p>

<p>We live with a recent history of massacres by governments that
have dwarfed in scope and cruelty anything Barlow or Jefferson
could have imagined. The Turkish massacre of the Armenians, the
Nazi <q>final solution</q>, the Soviet purges, the killing fields of
Cambodia, the Hutu-Tutsi massacres in Rwanda; each and every one of
these vast and hideous slaughters was preceded by and relied upon
the disarmament of the victims.</p>

<p>It is more important than ever, today after a century of blood,
that we retain the power both to protect ourselves and to discern
the cause of such oppressions. That cause has never been in
civilian arms borne by free people, but in their opposite and enemy
&mdash; the organized and conscienceless brutality of cancerous
states.</p>

<p>It is time to recognize that we, as individuals and as citizens
of our neighborhoods and our nations and our planet, have gone too
far down a road that leads only to disintegration of both society
and self &mdash; a future of atomized and alienated sheep, terrified by
the reflection in each others' eyes of the phantoms in their own
souls, easy prey for demagogues and dictators.</p>

<p>It is time for each of us to rediscover the dignity of free men
(and women) in the only way possible; by proving it in the crucible
of daily decision, even on ultimate matters of life and death. It
is time for us to embrace bearing arms again &mdash; not merely as a
deterrent against criminals and tyrants, but as a gift and
sacrament and affirmation to ourselves.</p>
