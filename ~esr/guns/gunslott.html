<h1>Abstract</h1>

&gt; 

<p>Using cross-sectional time-series data for U.S. counties from
1977 to 1992, we find that allowing citizens to carry concealed
weapons deters violent crimes and it appears to produce no increase
in accidental deaths. If those states which did not have
right-to-carry concealed gun provisions had adopted them in 1992,
approximately 1,570 murders; 4,177 rapes; and over 60,000 aggravate
assaults would have been avoided yearly. On the other hand,
consistent with the notion of criminals responding to incentives,
we find criminals substituting into property crimes involving
stealth and where the probabilities of contact between the criminal
and the victim are minimal. The largest population counties where
the deterrence effect on violent crimes is greatest are where the
substitution effect into property crimes is highest. Concealed
handguns also have their greatest deterrent effect in the highest
crime counties. Higher arrest and conviction rates consistently and
dramatically reduce the crime rate. Consistent with other recent
work (Lott, 1992b), the results imply that increasing the arrest
rate, independent of the probability of eventual conviction,
imposes a significant penalty on criminals. The estimated annual
gain from allowing concealed handguns is at least $6.214
billion.</p>

<h1>I. Introduction</h1>

<p>Will allowing concealed handguns make it likely that otherwise
law abiding citizens will harm each other? Or, will the threat of
citizens carrying weapons primarily deter criminals? To some, the
logic is fairly straightforward. Philip Cook argues that, "If you
introduce a gun into a violent encounter, it increases the chance
that someone will die."[1] A large number of murders may arise from
unintentional fits of rage that are quickly regretted, and simply
keeping guns out of people's reach would prevent deaths.[2] Using
the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), Cook (1991, p. 56,
fn. 4) further states that each year there are "only" 80,000 to
82,000 defensive uses of guns during assaults, robberies, and
household burglaries.[3] By contrast, other surveys imply that
private firearms may be used in self-defense up to two and a half
million times each year, with 400,000 of these defenders believing
that using the gun "almost certainly" saved a life (Kleck and
Gertz, 1995, pp. 153, 180, and 182-3).[4] With total firearm deaths
from homicides and accidents equaling 19,187 in 1991 (Statistical
Abstract of the United States, 1995), the Kleck and Gertz numbers,
even if wrong by a very large factor, suggest that defensive gun
use on net saved lives.</p>

<p>While cases like the 1992 incident where a Japanese student was
shot on his way to a Halloween party in Louisiana make
international headlines (Japan Economic Newswire, May 23, 1993 and
Sharn, USA TODAY, September 9, 1993), they are rare. In another
highly publicized case, a Dallas resident recently became the only
Texas resident so far charged with using a permitted concealed
weapon in a fatal shooting (Potok, March 22, 1996, p. 3A).[5] Yet,
in neither case was the shooting found to be unlawful.[6] The
rarity of these incidents is reflected in Florida statistics:
221,443 licenses were issued between October 1, 1987 and April 30,
1994, but only 18 crimes involving firearms were committed by those
with licenses (Cramer and Kopel, 1995, p. 691).[7] While a
statewide breakdown on the nature of those crimes is not available,
Dade county records indicate that four crimes involving a permitted
handgun took place there between September 1987 and August 1992 and
none of those cases resulted in injury (pp. 691-2).</p>

<p>The potential defensive nature of guns is indicated by the
different rates of so-called "hot burglaries," where residents are
at home when the criminals strike (e.g., Kopel, 1992, p. 155 and
Lott, 1994). Almost half the burglaries in Canada and Britain,
which have tough gun control laws, are "hot burglaries." By
contrast, the U.S., with laxer restrictions, has a "hot burglary"
rate of only 13 percent. Consistent with this, surveys of convicted
felons in America reveals that they are much more worried about
armed victims than they are about running into the police. This
fear of potentially armed victims causes American burglars to spend
more time than their foreign counterparts "casing" a house to
ensure that nobody is home. Felons frequently comment in these
interviews that they avoid late-night burglaries because "that's
the way to get shot."[8]</p>

<p>The case for concealed handgun use is similar. The use of
concealled handguns by some law abiding citizens may create a
positive externality for others. By the very nature of these guns
being concealed, criminals are unable to tell whether the victim is
armed before they strike, thus raising criminals' expected costs
for committing many types of crimes.</p>

<p>Stories of individuals using guns to defend themselves has
helped motivate thirty-one states to adopt laws requiring
authorities to issue, without discretion, concealed-weapons permits
to qualified applicants.[9] This constitutes a dramatic increase
from the nine states that allowed concealed weapons in 1986.[10]
While many studies examine the effects of gun control (see Kleck,
1995 for a survey), and a smaller number of papers specifically
address the right-to-carry concealed firearms (e.g., Cook, et al.,
1995; Cramer and Kopel, 1995; McDowall, et. al., 1995; and Kleck
and Patterson, 1993), these papers involve little more than either
time-series or cross-sectional evidence comparing mean crime rates,
and none controls for variables that normally concern economists
(e.g., the probability of arrest and conviction and the length of
prison sentences or even variables like personal income).[11] These
papers fail to recognize that, since it is frequently only the
largest population counties that are very restrictive when local
authorities have been given discretion in granting concealed
handgun permits, "shall issue" concealed handgun permit laws, which
require permit requests be granted unless the individual has a
criminal record or a history of significant mental illness (Cramer
and Kopel, 1995, pp. 680-707), will not alter the number of permits
being issued in all counties.</p>

<p>Other papers suffer from additional weaknesses. The paper by
McDowall, et. al. (1995), which evaluates right-to-carry
provisions, was widely cited in the popular press. Yet, their study
suffers from many major methodological flaws: for instance, without
explanation, they pick only three cities in Florida and one city
each in Mississippi and Oregon (despite the provisions involving
statewide laws); and they neither use the same sample period nor
the same method of picking geographical areas for each of those
cities.[12]</p>

<p>Our paper hopes to overcome these problems by using annual
cross-sectional time-series county level crime data for the entire
United States from 1977 to 1992 to investigate the impact of "shall
issue" right-to-carry firearm laws. It is also the first paper to
study the questions of deterrence using these data. While many
recent studies employ proxies for deterrence -- such as police
expenditures or general levels of imprisonment (Levitt, 1996) -- we
are able to use arrest rates by type of crime, and for a subset of
our data also conviction rates and sentence lengths by type of
crime.[13] We also attempt to analyze a question noted but not
empirically addressed in this literature: the concern over
causality between increases in handgun usage and crime rates. Is it
higher crime that leads to increased handgun ownership, or the
reverse? The issue is more complicated than simply whether carrying
concealed firearms reduces murders because there are questions over
whether criminals might substitute between different types of
crimes as well as the extent to which accidental handgun deaths
might increase.</p>

<h1>II. Problems Testing the Impact of "Shall Issue" Concealed
Handgun Provisions on Crime</h1>

<p>Starting with Becker (1968), many economists have found evidence
broadly consistent with the deterrent effect of punishment (e.g.,
Ehrlich (1973), Block and Heineke (1975), Landes (1978), Lott
(1987), Andreoni (1995), Reynolds (1995), and Levitt (1996)). The
notion is that the expected penalty affects the prospective
criminal's desire to commit a crime. This penalty consists of the
probabilities of arrest and conviction and the length of the prison
sentence. It is reasonable to disentangle the probability of arrest
from the probability of conviction since accused individuals appear
to suffer large reputational penalties simply from being arrested
(Lott, 1992b). Likewise, conviction also imposes many different
penalties (e.g., lost licenses, lost voting rights, further
reductions in earnings, etc.) even if the criminal is never
sentenced to prison (Lott, 1990b, 1992a and b).</p>

<p>While this discussion is well understood, the net effect of
"shall issue" right-to-carry, concealed handguns is ambiguous and
remains to be tested when other factors influencing the returns to
crime are controlled for. The first difficulty involves the
availability of detailed county level data on a variety of crimes
over 3054 counties during the period from 1977 to 1992.
Unfortunately, for the time period we study, the FBI's Uniform
Crime Report only includes arrest rate data rather than conviction
rates or prison sentences. While we make use of the arrest rate
information, we will also use county level dummies, which
admittedly constitute a rather imperfect way to control for cross
county differences such as differences in expected penalties.
Fortunately, however, alternative variables are available to help
us proxy for changes in legal regimes that affect the crime rate.
One such method is to use another crime category as an exogenous
variable that is correlated with the crimes that we are studying,
but at the same time is unrelated to the changes in right-to-carry
firearm laws. Finally, after telephoning law enforcement officials
in all 50 states, we were able to collect time-series county level
conviction rates and mean prison sentence lengths for three states
(Arizona, Oregon, and Washington).</p>

<p>The FBI crime reports include seven categories of crime: murder,
rape, aggravated assault, robbery, auto theft, burglary, and
larceny.[14] Two additional summary categories were included:
violent crimes (including murder, rape, aggravated assault, and
robbery) and property crimes (including auto theft, burglary, and
larceny). Despite being widely reported measures in the press,
these broader categories are somewhat problematic in that all
crimes are given the same weight (e.g., one murder equals one
aggravated assault). Even the narrower categories are somewhat
broad for our purposes. For example, robbery includes not only
street robberies which seem the most likely to be affected by
"shall issue" laws, but also bank robberies where the additional
return to having armed citizens would appear to be small.[15]
Likewise, larceny involves crimes of "stealth," but these range
from pick pockets, where "shall issue" laws could be important, to
coin machine theft.[16]</p>

<p>This aggregation of crime categories makes it difficult to
separate out which crimes might be deterred from increased handgun
ownership, and which crimes might be increasing as a result of a
substitution effect. Generally, we expect that the crimes most
likely to be deterred by concealed handgun laws are those involving
direct contact between the victim and the criminal, especially
those occurring in a place where victims otherwise would not be
allowed to carry firearms. For example, aggravated assault, murder,
robbery, and rape seem most likely to fit both conditions, though
obviously some of all these crimes can occur in places like
residences where the victims could already possess firearms to
protect themselves.</p>

<p>By contrast, crimes like auto theft seem unlikely to be deterred
by gun ownership. While larceny is more debatable, in general __ to
the extent that these crimes actually involve "stealth" __ the
probability that victims will notice the crime being committed
seems low and thus the opportunities to use a gun are relatively
rare. The effect on burglary is ambiguous from a theoretical
standpoint. It is true that if "shall issue" laws cause more people
to own a gun, the chance of a burglar breaking into a house with an
armed resident goes up. However, if some of those who already owned
guns now obtain right-to-carry permits, the relative cost of crimes
like armed street robbery and certain other types of robberies
(where an armed patron may be present) should rise relative to that
for burglary.</p>

<p>Previous concealed handgun studies that rely on state level data
suffer from an important potential problem: they ignore the
heterogeneity within states (e.g., Linsky, et. al., 1988 and Cramer
and Kopel, 1995). Our telephone conversations with many law
enforcement officials have made it very clear that there was a
large variation across counties within a state in terms of how
freely gun permits were granted to residents prior to the adoption
of "shall issue" right-to-carry laws.[17] All those we talked to
strongly indicated that the most populous counties had previously
adopted by far the most restrictive practices on issuing permits.
The implication for existing studies is that simply using state
level data rather than county data will bias the results against
finding any impact from passing right-to-carry provisions. Those
counties that were unaffected by the law must be separated out from
those counties where the change could be quite dramatic. Even
cross-sectional city data (e.g., Kleck and Patterson, 1993) will
not solve this problem, because without time series data it is
impossible to know what impact a change in the law had for a
particular city.</p>

<p>There are two ways of handling this problem. First, for the
national sample, we can see whether the passage of "shall issue"
right-to-carry laws produces systematically different effects
between the high and low population counties. Second, for three
states, Arizona, Oregon, and Pennsylvania, we have acquired time
series data on the number of right-to-carry permits for each
county. The normal difficulty with using data on the number of
permits involves the question of causality: do more permits make
crimes more costly or do higher crimes lead to more permits? The
change in the number of permits before and after the change in the
state laws allows us to rank the counties on the basis of how
restrictive they had actually been in issuing permits prior to the
change in the law. Of course there is still the question of why the
state concealed handgun law changed, but since we are dealing with
county level rather than state level data we benefit from the fact
that those counties which had the most restrictive permitting
policies were also the most likely to have the new laws exogenously
imposed upon them by the rest of their state.</p>

<p>Using county level data also has another important advantage in
that both crime and arrest rates vary widely within states. In
fact, as Table 1 indicates, the standard deviation of both crime
and arrest rates across states is almost always smaller than the
average within state standard deviation across counties. With the
exception of robbery, the standard deviation across states for
crime rates ranges from between 61 and 83 percent of the average of
the standard deviation within states. (The difference between these
two columns with respect to violent crimes arises because robberies
make up such a large fraction of the total crimes in this
category.) For arrest rates, the numbers are much more dramatic,
with the standard deviation across states as small as 15 percent of
the average of the standard deviation within states. These results
imply that it is no more accurate to view all the counties in the
typical state as a homogenous unit than it is to view all the
states in the United States as one homogenous unit. For example,
when a state's arrest rate rises, it may make a big difference
whether that increase is taking place in the most or least crime
prone counties. Depending upon which types of counties the changes
in arrest rates are occurring in and depending on how sensitive the
crime rates are to changes in those particular counties could
produce widely differring estimates of how increasing a state's
average arrest rate will deter crime. Aggregating these data may
thus make it more difficult to discern the true relationship that
exists between deterrence and crime.</p>

<p>Perhaps the relatively small across-state variation as compared
to within-state variations is not so surprising given that states
tend to average out differences as they encompass both rural and
urban areas. Yet, when coupled with the preceding discussion on how
concealed handgun provisions affected different counties in the
same state differently, these numbers strongly imply that it risky
to assume that states are homogenous units with respect to either
how crimes are punished or how the laws which affect gun usage are
changed. Unfortunately, this focus of state level data is pervasive
in the entire crime literature, which focuses on state or city
level data and fails to recognize the differences between rural and
urban counties.</p>

<p>However, using county level data has some drawbacks. Frequently,
because of the low crime rates in many low population counties, it
is quite common to find huge variations in the arrest and
conviction rates between years. In addition, our sample indicates
that annual conviction rates for some counties are as high as 13
times the offense rate. This anomaly arises for a couple reasons.
First, the year in which the offense occurs frequently differs from
the year in which the arrests and/or convictions occur. Second, an
offense may involve more than one offender. Unfortunately, the FBI
data set allows us neither to link the years in which offenses and
arrests occurred nor to link offenders with a particular crime.
When dealing with counties where only a couple murders occur
annually, arrests or convictions can be multiples higher than the
number of offenses in a year. This data problem appears especially
noticeable for murder and rape.</p>

<p>One partial solution is to limit the sample to only counties
with large populations. For counties with a large numbers of
crimes, these waves have a significantly smoother flow of arrests
and convictions relative to offenses. An alternative solution is to
take a moving average of the arrest or conviction rates over
several years, though this reduces the length of the usable sample
period, depending upon how many years are used to compute this
average. Furthermore, the moving average solution does nothing to
alleviate the effect of multiple suspects being arrested for a
single crime.</p>

<p>Another concern is that otherwise law abiding citizens may have
carried concealed handguns even before it was legal to do so. If
shall issue laws do not alter the total number of concealed
handguns carried by otherwise law abiding citizens but merely
legalizes their previous actions, passing these laws seems unlikely
to affect crime rates. The only real effect from making concealed
handguns legal could arise from people being more willing to use
handguns to defend themselves, though this might also imply that
they more likely to make mistakes using these handguns.</p>

<p>It is also possible that concealed firearm laws both make
individuals safer and increase crime rates at the same time. As
Peltzman (1975) has pointed out in the context of automobile safety
regulations, increasing safety can result in drivers offsetting
these gains by taking more risks in how they drive. The same thing
is possible with regard to crime. For example, allowing citizens to
carry concealed firearms may encourage people to risk entering more
dangerous neighborhoods or to begin traveling during times they
previously avoided. Thus, since the decision to engage in these
riskier activities is a voluntary one, it is possible that society
still could be better off even if crime rates were to rise as a
result of concealed handgun laws.</p>

<p>Finally, there are also the issues of why certain states adopted
concealed handgun laws and whether higher offense rates result in
lower arrest rates. To the extent that states adopted the law
because crime were rising, ordinary least squares estimates would
underpredict the drop in crime. Likewise, if the rules were adopted
when crimes rates were falling, the bias would be in the opposite
direction. None of the previous studies deal with this last type of
potential bias. At least since Ehrlich (1973, pp. 548-553),
economists have also realized that potential biases exist from
having the offense rate as both the endogenous variable and as the
denominator in determining the arrest rate and because increasing
crime rates may lower the arrest if the same resources are being
asked to do more work. Fortunately, both these sets of potential
biases can be dealt with using two-stage least-squares.</p>

<h1>III. The Data</h1>

<p>Between 1977 and 1992, 10 states (Florida (1987), Georgia
(1989), Idaho (1990), Maine (1985), Mississippi (1990), Montana
(1991), Oregon (1990), Pennsylvania (1989), Virginia (1988), and
West Virginia (1989)) adopted "shall issue" right-to-carry firearm
laws. However, Pennsylvania is a special case because Philadelphia
was exempted from the state law during our sample period. Nine
other states (Alabama, Connecticut, Indiana, Maine, New Hampshire,
North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, and Washington) effectively
had these laws on the books prior to the period being studied.[18]
Since the data are at the county level, a dummy variable is set
equal to one for each county operating under "shall issue"
right-to-carry laws. A Nexis search was conducted to determine the
exact date on which these laws took effect. For the states that
adopted the law during the year, the dummy variable for that year
is scaled to equal that portion of the year for which the law was
in effect.</p>

<p>While the number of arrests and offenses for each type of crime
in every county from 1977 to 1992 were provided by the Uniform
Crime Report, we also contacted the state department of
corrections, State Attorney Generals, State Secretary of State, and
State Police offices in every state to try to compile data on
conviction rates, sentence lengths, and right-to-carry concealed
weapons permits by county. The Bureau of Justice Statistics also
released a list of contacts in every state that might have
available state level criminal justice data. Unfortunately, county
data on the total number of outstanding right-to-carry pistol
permits were available for only Arizona, California, Florida,
Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Washington, though time series county
data before and after a change in the permitting law was only
available for Arizona (1994 to 1996), Oregon (1990 to 1992) and
Pennsylvania (1986 to 1992). Since the Oregon "shall issue" law
passed in 1990, we attempted to get data on the number of permits
in 1989 by calling up every county sheriff in Oregon, with 25 of
the 36 counties providing us with this information. (The remaining
counties claimed that records had not been kept.)[19] For Oregon,
data on the county level conviction rate and prison sentence length
was also available from 1977 to 1992.</p>

<p>One difficulty with the sentence length data is that Oregon
passed a sentencing reform act that went into effect in November
1989 causing criminals to serve 85 percent of their sentence, and
thus judges may have correspondingly altered their rulings. Even
then, this change was phased in over time because the law only
applied to crimes that took place after it went into effect in
1989. In addition, the Oregon system did not keep complete records
prior to 1987, and the completeness of these records decreased the
further into the past one went. One solution to both of these
problems is to interact the prison sentence length with year dummy
variables. A similar problem exists for Arizona which adopted a
truth-in-sentencing reform during the fall of 1994. Finally,
Arizona is different from Oregon and Pennsylvania in that it
already allowed handguns to be carried openly before passing its
concealed handgun law, thus one might expect to find a somewhat
smaller response to adopting a concealed handgun law.</p>

<p>In addition to using county dummy variables, other data were
collected from the Bureau of the Census to try controlling for
other demographic characteristics that might determine the crime
rate. These data included information on the population density per
square mile, total county population, and detailed information on
the racial and age breakdown of the county (percent of population
by each racial group and by sex between 10 and 19 years of age,
between 20 and 29, between 30 and 39, between 40 and 49, between 50
and 64, and 65 and over). (See Table 2 for the list and summary
statistics.) While a large literature discusses the likelihood of
younger males engaging in crime (e.g., Wilson and Herrnstein, 1985,
pp. 126-147), controlling for these other categories allows us to
also attempt to measure the size of the groups considered most
vulnerable (e.g., females in the case of rape).[20] Recent evidence
by Glaeser and Sacerdote (1995) confirms the higher crime rates
experienced in cities and examines to what extent this arises due
to social and family influences as well as the changing pecuniary
benefits from crime, though this is the first paper to explicitly
control for population density. The data appendix provides a more
complete discussion of the data.</p>

<p>An additional set of income data was also used. These included
real per capita personal income, real per capita unemployment
insurance payments, real per capita income maintenance payments,
and real per capita retirement payments per person over 65 years of
age.[21] Including unemployment insurance and income maintenance
payments from the Commerce Department's Regional Economic
Information System (REIS) data set were attempts to provide annual
county level measures of unemployment and the distribution of
income.</p>

<p>Finally, we recognize that other legal changes in penalties
involving improper gun use might also have been changing
simultaneously with changes in the permitting requirements for
concealed handguns. In order to see whether this might confound our
ability to infer what was responsible for any observed changes in
crimes rates we read through various editions of the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms' State Laws and Published Ordinances
- Firearms (1976, 1986, 1989, and 1994). Excluding the laws
regarding machine guns and sawed-off shotguns, there is no evidence
that the laws involving the use of guns changed significantly when
concealed permit rules were changed.[22] Another survey which
addresses the somewhat boarder question of sentencing enhancement
laws for felonies committed with deadly weapons (firearms,
explosives, and knives) from 1970-1992 also confirms this general
finding with all but four of the legal changes clustered from 1970
to 1981 (Marvell and Moody, 1995, pp. 258-261). Yet, controlling
for the dates supplied by Marvell and Moody still allows us to
examine the deterrence effect of criminal penalties specifically
targeted at the use of deadly weapons during this earlier
period.[23]</p>

<h1>IV. The Empirical Evidence</h1>

<h2>A. Using County Data for the United States</h2>

<p>The first group of regressions reported in Table 3 attempt to
explain the natural log of the crime rate for nine different
categories of crime. The regressions are run using weighted
ordinary least squares. While we are primarily interested in a
dummy variable to represent whether a state has a "shall issue"
law, we also control for each type of crime's the arrest rate,
demographic differences, and dummies for the fixed effects for
years and counties. The results imply that "shall issue" laws
coincide with fewer murders, rapes, aggravated assaults, and
rapes.[24] On the other hand, auto theft and larceny rates rise.
Both changes are consistent with our discussion on the direct and
substitution effects produced by concealed weapons.[25] Rerunning
these specifications with only the "shall issue" dummy, the arrest
rates, and the fixed year and county effects produces even more
significant effects for the "shall issue" dummy and the arrest
rates.</p>

<p>The results are large empirically. When state concealed handgun
laws went into effect in a county, murders fell by 8.5 percent, and
rapes and aggravated assaults fell by 5 and 7 percent. In 1992,
there were 18,469 murders; 79,272 rapes; 538,368 robberies; and
861,103 aggravated assaults in counties without "shall issue" laws.
The coefficients imply that if these counties had been subject to
state concealed handgun laws, murders in the United States would
have declined by 1,570. Given the concern that has been raised
about increased accidental deaths from concealed weapons, it is
interesting to note that the entire number of accidental gun deaths
in the United States in 1992 was 1,409. Of this total, 546
accidental deaths were in states with concealed handgun laws and
863 were in those without these laws. The reduction in murders is
as much as three times greater than the total number of accidental
deaths in concealed handgun states. Thus, if our results are
accurate, the net effect of allowing concealed handguns is clearly
to save lives. Similarly, the results indicate that the number of
rapes in states without "shall issue" laws would have declined by
4,177; aggravated assaults by 60,363; and robberies by
11,898.[26]</p>

<p>On the other hand, property crime rates definitely increased
after "shall issue" laws were implemented. The results are equally
dramatic. If states without concealed handgun laws had passed such
laws, there would have been 247,165 more property crimes in 1992 (a
2.7 percent increase). Thus, criminals respond substantially to the
threat of being shot by instead substituting into less risky
crimes.[27]</p>

<p>A recent National Institute of Justice study (Miller, Cohen, and
Wiersema, 1996) provides estimates the costs of different types of
crime based upon lost productivity; out-of-pocket expenses such as
medical bills and property losses; and losses for fear, pain,
suffering, and lost quality of life. While there are questions
about using jury awards to measure losses such as fear, pain,
suffering, and lost quality of life, the estimates provide us one
method of comparing the reduction in violent crimes with the
increase in property crimes. Using the numbers from Table 3, the
estimated gain from allowing concealed handguns is over $6.214
billion in 1992 dollars. The reduction in violent crimes represents
a gain of $6.6 billion ($4.75 billion from murder, $1.4 billion
from aggravated assault, $374 million from rape, and $98 million
from robbery), while the increase in property crimes represents a
loss of $417 million ($342 million from auto theft, $73 million
from larceny, and $1.5 million from burglary). However, while $6.2
billion is substantial, to put it into perspective, it equals only
about 1.33 percent of the total aggregate losses from these crime
categories. These estimates are probably most sensitive to the
value of life used (in the Miller et. al. study this was set at
$1.84 million in 1992 dollars). Higher estimated values of life
will increase the net gains from concealed handgun use, while lower
values of life will reduce the gains.[28] To the extent that people
are taking greater risks towards crime because of any increased
safety produced by concealed handgun laws (again see Peltzman
(1975)), these numbers will underestimate the total savings from
concealed handguns.</p>

<p>The arrest rate produces the most consistent effect on crime.
Higher arrest rates imply lower crime rates for all categories of
crime. A one standard deviation change in the probability of arrest
accounts for 3 to 17 percent of a one standard deviation change in
the various crime rates. The crime most responsive to arrest rates
is burglary (11 percent), followed by property crimes (10 percent);
aggravated assault and violent crimes more generally (9 percent);
murder (7 percent); rape, robbery, and larceny (4 percent); and
auto theft (both 3 percent).</p>

<p>For property crimes, a one standard deviation change in the
percent of the population that is black, male, and between 10 and
19 years of age explains 22 percent of these crime rates. For
violent crimes, the same number is 5 percent. Other patterns also
show up in the data. For example, more black females between the
ages of 20 and 39, more white females between the ages of 10 and 39
and those over 65, and other race females between 20 and 29 are
positively and significantly associated with a greater number of
rapes occurring. Population density appears to be most important in
explaining robbery, burglary, and auto theft rates, with a one
standard deviation change in population density being able to
explain 36 percent of a one standard deviation change in auto
theft. Perhaps most surprising is the relatively small, even if
frequently significant, effect of income on crime rates. A one
standard deviation change in real per capita income explains no
more than 4 percent of a one standard deviation change in crime and
in seven of the specifications it explains 2 percent or less of the
change. If the race, sex, and age variables are replaced with
variables showing the percent of the population that is black and
the percent that is white, 50 percent of a standard deviation in
the murder rate is explained by the percent of the population that
is black. Given the high rates that blacks are arrested and
incarcerated or are victims of crimes, this is not unexpected.</p>

<p>Rerunning the regressions by adding a dummy variable to control
for state laws that increase sentencing penalties when deadly
weapon are used (Marvell and Moody, 1995, pp. 259-260) has no
noticeable effect on the concealed handgun coefficients. The
enhanced sentencing law dummy is negative and statistically
significant only for aggravated assaults, with the coefficient
implying that adopting this type of law reduces aggravate assaults
by 4 percent. Otherwise these laws generally appear to have little
effect on crime rates.</p>

<p>Given the wide use of state level crime data by economists and
the large within state heterogeneity shown in Table 1, Table 4
provides a comparison by reestimating the specifications reported
in Table 3 using state level rather than county level data. The
only other difference in the specification is the replacement of
county dummies with state dummies. While the results in these two
tables are generally similar, two differences immediately manifest
themselves: 1) all the specifications now imply a negative and
almost always significant relationship between allowing concealed
handguns and the level of crime and 2) concealed handgun laws
explain much more of the variation in crime rates while arrest
rates (with the exception of robbery) explain much less of the
variation.[29] Despite the fact that concealed handgun laws appear
to lower both violent and property crime rates, the results still
imply that violent crimes are much more sensitive to the
introduction of concealed handguns, with violent crimes falling
three times more than property crimes. These results imply that if
all states had adopted concealed handgun laws in 1992, 1,777 fewer
murders and 7,000 fewer rapes would have taken place.[30] Overall,
Table 4 implies that the estimated gain from the lower crime
produced by handguns was $10.3 billion in 1992 dollars (see Table
5). Yet, at least in the case of property crimes, the concealed
handgun law coefficients' sensitivity to whether these regressions
are run at the state or county level suggests caution in
aggregating these data into such large units as states.</p>

<p>Table 6 examines whether changes in concealed handgun laws and
arrest rates have differential effects in high or low crime
counties. To test this, the regressions shown in Table 3 were
reestimated first using the sample above the median crime rate by
type of crime and then separately using the sample below the
median. High crime rates may also breed more crime because the
stigma from arrest may be less when crime is rampant (Ramusen,
1996). If so, any change in apprehension rates should produce a
greater reputational impact and thus greater deterrence in low
crime than high crime counties.</p>

<p>The results indicate that the concealed handgun law's
coefficient signs are consistently the same for both low and high
crime counties, though for two of the crime categories (rape and
aggravate assault) concealed handgun laws have only statistically
significant effects in the relatively high crime counties. For most
violent crimes such as murder, rape, and aggravated assault
concealed weapons laws have a much greater deterrent effect in high
crime counties, while for robbery, property crimes, auto theft,
burglary, and larceny the effect appears to be greatest in low
crime counties. The table also shows that the deterrent effect of
arrests is significantly different at least at the 5 percent level
between high and low crime counties for eight of the nine crime
categories (the one exception being violent crimes). The results do
not support the claim that arrests produce a greater reputational
penalty in low crime areas. While additional arrests in low and
high crime counties produce virtually identical changes in violent
crime rates, the arrest rate coefficient for high crime counties is
almost four times bigger than it is for low crime counties.</p>

<p>One relationship in these first three sets of regressions
deserves a special comment. Despite the relatively small number of
women using concealed handgun permits, the concealed handgun
coefficient for explaining rapes is consistently comparable in size
to the effect that this variable has on other violent crimes rates.
In Washington and Oregon states in January 1996, women constituted
18.6 and 22.9 percent of those with concealed handgun permits for a
total of 118,728 and 51,859 permits respectively.[31] The
time-series data which are available for Oregon during our sample
period even indicates that only 17.6 percent of permit holders were
women in 1991. While it is possible that the set of women who are
particularly likely to be raped might already carry concealed
handguns at much higher rates than the general population of women,
the results are at least suggestive that rapists are particularly
susceptable to this form of deterrence. Possibly this arises since
providing a woman with a gun has a much bigger affect on her
ability to defend herself against a crime than providing a handgun
to a man. Thus even if relatively few women carry handguns, the
expected change in the cost of attacking women could still be
nearly as great. To phrase this differently, the external benefits
to other women from a women carrying a concealed handgun appear to
be large relative to the gain produced by an additional man
carrying a concealed handgun. If concealed handgun use were to be
subsidized to capture these positive externalities, these results
are consistent with efficiency requiring that women receive the
largest subsidies.[32]</p>

<p>As mentioned in Section II, an important concern with these data
is that passing a concealed handgun law should not affect all
counties equally. In particular, we expect that it was the most
populous counties that most restricted people's ability to carry
concealed weapons. To test this, Table 7 repeats all the
regressions in Table 3 but instead interacts the Shall Issue Law
Adopted Dummy with county population. While all the other
coefficients remain virtually unchanged, this new interaction
retains the same signs as those for the original Shall Issue Dummy,
and in all but one case the coefficients are more significant. The
coefficients are consistent with the hypothesis that the new laws
produced the greatest change in the largest counties. The larger
counties have a much greater response in both directions to changes
in the laws. Violent crimes fall more and property crimes rise more
in the largest counties. The bottom of the table indicates how
these effects vary for different size counties. For example,
passing a concealed handgun law lowers the murder rate in cities
two standard deviations above the mean population by 12 percent,
7.4 times more than a shall issue laws lowers murders for the mean
population city. While the law enforcement officers we talked to
continually mentioned population as being the key variable, we also
reran these regressions using population density as the variable
that we interacted with the shall issue dummy. The results remain
very similar to those reported.</p>

<p>Admittedly, although arrest rates and county fixed effects are
controlled for, these regressions have thus far controlled for
expected penalties in a limited way. Table 8 reruns the regressions
in Table 7 but includes either the burglary or robbery rates to
proxy for other changes in the criminal justice system. Robbery and
burglary are the violent and property crime categories that are the
least related to changes in concealed handgun laws, but they are
still positively correlated with all the other types of crimes. One
additional minor change is made in two of the earlier
specifications. In order to avoid any artificial collinearity
either between violent crime and robbery or between property crimes
and burglary, violent crimes net of robbery and property crimes net
of burglary are used as the endogenous variables when robbery or
burglary are controlled for.</p>

<p>Some evidence that burglary or robbery rates will proxy for
other changes in the criminal justice system can be seen in their
correlations with other crime categories. The Pearson correlation
coefficient between robbery and the other crime categories ranges
between .49 and .80, and all are statistically significant at least
at the .0001 level. For burglary the correlations range from .45 to
.68, and they are also equally statistically significant. The two
sets of specifications reported in Table 8 closely bound our
earlier estimates, and the estimates continue to imply that the
introduction of concealed handgun laws coincided with similarly
large drops in violent crimes and increases in property crimes. The
only difference with the preceding results is that they now imply
that the affect on robberies is statistically significant. The
estimates on the other control variables also essentially remain
unchanged.</p>

<p>We also reestimated the regressions in Table 3 using first
differences on all the control variables (see Table 9). These
regressions were run using a dummy variable for the presence of
"shall issue" concealed handgun laws and differencing that
variable, and the results consistently indicate a negative and
statistically significant effect from the legal change for violent
crimes, rape, and aggravated assault. Shall issue laws negatively
affect murder rates in both specifications, but the effect is only
statistically significant when the shall issue variable is also
differenced. The property crime results are also consistent with
those shown in the previous tables, showing a positive impact of
shall issue laws on crime rates. Perhaps not surprisingly, the
results imply that the gun laws immediately altered crime rates,
but that an additional change was spread out over time, possibly
because concealed handgun use did not instantly move to its new
steady state level. The annual decrease in violent crimes averaged
about 2 percent, while the annual increase in property crimes
average about 5 percent.</p>

<p>All the results in tables 3, 6, and 7 were reestimated to deal
with the concerns raised in Section II over the "noise" in arrest
rates arising from the timing of offenses and arrests and the
possibility of multiple offenders. We reran all the regressions in
this section first by limiting the sample to those counties over
100,000 and then 200,000 people. Consistent with the evidence
reported in Table 7, the more the sample was limited to larger
population counties the stronger and more statistically significant
was the relationship between concealed handgun laws and the
previously reported effects on crime. The arrest rate results also
tended to be stronger and more significant. We also tried rerunning
all the regressions by redefining the arrest rate as the number of
arrests over the last three years divided by the total number of
offenses over the last three years. Despite the reduced sample
size, the results remained similar to those already reported.</p>

<p>Not only does this initial empirical work provide strong
evidence that concealed handgun laws reduce violent crime and that
higher arrest rates deter all types of crime, but the work also
allows us to evaluate some of the broader empirical issues
concerning criminal deterrence discussed in Section II. The results
confirm some of our earlier discussion on potential aggregation
problems with state level data. County level data implies that
arrest rates explain about six times the variation in violent crime
rates and eight times the variation in property crime rates that
arrest rates explain when we use state level data. Breaking the
data down by whether a county is a high or a low crime county
indicates that arrest rates do not affect crime rates equally in
all counties. The evidence also confirms the claims of law
enforcement officials that "Shall Issue" laws represented more of a
change in how the most populous counties permitted concealed
handguns. One concern that was not borne out was over whether state
level regressions could bias the coefficients on the concealed
handgun laws towards zero. In fact, while state and county level
regressions produce widely different coefficients for property
crimes, seven of the nine crime categories imply that the effect of
concealed handgun laws was much larger when state level data were
used. However, one conclusion is clear: the very different results
between state and county level data should make us very cautious in
aggregating crime data and would imply that the data should remain
as disaggregated as possible.</p>

<h2>B. The Endogeniety of Arrest Rates and the Passage of Concealed
Handgun Laws</h2>

<p>The previous specifications have assumed that both the arrest
rate and the passage of concealed handgun laws are exogenous.
Following Ehrlich (1973, pp. 548-551), we allow for the arrest rate
to be a function of: the lagged crime rates; per capita and per
violent and property crimes measures of police employment and
payroll at the state level (these three different measures of
employment are also broken down by whether police officers have the
power to make arrest); the measures of income, unemployment
insurance payments, and the percentages of county population by
age, sex, and race used in Table 3; and county and year
dummies.[33] In an attempt to control for political influences, we
also included the percent of a state's population that are members
of the National Rifle Association and the percent of the vote
received by the Republican presidential candidate at the state
level. Because presidential candidates and issues vary between
elections, the percent voting Republican is undoubtedly not
directly comparable across years. To account for these difference
across elections, we interacted the percent voting Republican with
dummy variables for the years immediately next to the relevant
elections. Thus, the percent of the vote obtained in 1980 is
multiplied by a year dummy for the years from 1979 to 1982, the
percent of the vote obtained in 1984 is multiplied by a year dummy
for the years from 1983 to 1986, and so on through the 1992
election. A second set of regressions explaining the arrest rate
also include the change in the natural log of the crime rates to
proxy for the difficulty police forces face in adjusting to
changing circumstances.[34] However, the time period studied in all
these regressions is more limited than in our previous tables
because state level data on police employment and payroll are only
available from the U.S. Department of Justices' Expenditure and
Employment data for the Criminal Justice System from 1982 to
1992.</p>

<p>There is also the question of why some states adopted concealed
handgun laws while others did not. As noted earlier, to the extent
that states adopted the law because crime was either rising or was
expected to increase, ordinary least squares estimates underpredict
the drop in crime. Similarly, if these rules were adopted when
crimes rates were falling, a bias is in the opposite direction.
Thus, in order to predict whether a county would be in a state with
concealed handgun laws we used both the natural logs of the violent
and property crime rates and the first differences of those crime
rates. To control for general political differences that might
affect the chances of these laws being adopted, we also included
the National Rifle Association membership as a percent of a state's
population; the Republican presidential candidate's percent of the
statewide vote; the percentage a state's population that is black
and the percent white; the total population in the state; regional
dummy variables for whether the state is in the South, Northeast,
or Midwest; and year dummy variables.</p>

<p>While the 2SLS estimates shown in the top half of Table 10 again
use the same set of control variables employed in the preceding
tables, the results differ from all our previous estimates in one
important respect: concealed handgun laws are associated with large
significant drops in the levels of all nine crime categories. For
the estimates most similar to Ehrlich's study, five of the
estimates imply that a one standard deviation change in the
predicted value of the Shall Issue Law dummy variable explains at
least 10 percent of a standard deviation change in the
corresponding crime rates. In fact, concealed handgun laws explain
a greater percentage of the change in murder rates than do arrest
rates. With the exception of robbery, the set of estimates using
the change in crime rates to explain arrest rates indicates a
usually more statistically significant but economically smaller
effect from concealed handgun laws. For example, concealed handgun
laws now explains 3.9 percent of the variation in murder rates
compared to 7.5 percent in the preceding results. While these
results imply that even crimes with relatively little contact
between victims and criminals experienced declines, the
coefficients for violent crimes are still relatively more negative
than the coefficients for property crimes.</p>

<p>For the first stage regressions explaining which states adopt
concealed handgun laws (shown in the bottom half of Table 10), both
the least square and logit estimates imply that the states adopting
these laws are relatively Republican with large National Rifle
Association memberships and low but rising violent and property
crime rates. The other set of regressions used to explain the
arrest rate shows that arrest rates are lower in high income,
sparsely populated, Republican areas where crime rates are
increasing.</p>

<p>We also reestimated the state level data using similar two-stage
least squares specifications. The coefficients on both the arrest
rates and concealed handgun law variables remained consistently
negative and statistically significant, with the state level data
again implying a much stronger effect from concealed handguns and a
much weaker effect from higher arrest rates. Finally, in order to
use the longer data series available for the nonpolice employment
and payroll variables, we reran the regressions without those
variables and produced similar results.</p>

<h2>C. Concealed Handgun Laws, the Method of Murder, and the Choice
of Murder Victims</h2>

<p>Do concealed handgun laws cause a substitution in the methods of
committing murders? For example, it is possible that the number of
gun murders rises after these laws are passed even though the total
number of murders falls. While concealed handgun laws raise the
cost of committing murders, murderers may also find it relatively
more dangerous to kill people using nongun methods once people
start carrying concealed handguns and substitute into guns to put
themselves on a more even basis with their potential prey. Using
data on the method of murder from the Mortality Detail Records
provided by the United States Department of Health and Human
Services, we reran the murder rate regression from Table 3 on
counties over 100,000 during the period from 1982 to 1991. We then
separated out murders caused by guns from all other murders. Table
11 shows that carrying concealed handguns appears to have been
associated with approximately equal drops in both categories of
murders. Carrying concealed handguns appears to make all types of
murders realtively less attractive.</p>

<p>There is also the question of what effect does conceal handgun
laws have on determining which types of people are more likely to
be murdered? Using the Uniform Crime Reports Supplementary Homicide
Reports we were able to obtain annual state level data from 1977 to
1992 on the percent of victims by sex and race as well as
information on the whether the victim and the offender knew each
other (whether they were members of the same family, knew each
other but were not members of the same family, strangers, or the
relationship is unknown).[35] Table 12 implies no statistically
significant relationship between the concealed handgun dummy and
the victim's sex, race, or relationships with offenders. However,
while they are not quite statistically significant at the .10 level
for a two-tailed t-test, two of the point estimates appear
economically important and imply that in states with concealed
handgun laws victims know their nonfamily offenders 2.6 percentage
points more frequently and that the percent of victims where it was
not possible to determine whether a relationship existed declined
by 2.9 percentage points. This raises the question of whether
concealed handguns cause criminals to substitute into crimes
against those whom they know and presumably are also more likely to
know whether they carry concealed handguns.</p>

<p>The arrest rate for murder variable produces more interesting
results. The percent of white victims and the percent of victims
killed by family members both declined when states passed concealed
handgun laws, while the percent of black victims and the percent
that killed by nonfamily members that they know both increased. The
results imply that higher arrest rates have a much greater
deterrence effect on murders involving whites and family members.
One explanation is that whites with higher incomes face a greater
increase in expected penalties for any given increase in the
probability of arrest.</p>

<h2>D. Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Oregon County Data</h2>

<p>One problem with the preceding results was the use of county
population as a proxy for how restrictive counties were in allowing
concealed handgun permits before the passage of "shall issue" laws.
Since we are still going to control county specific levels of crime
with county dummies, a better measure would have been to use the
actual change in a gun permits before and after the adoption of a
concealed handgun law. Fortunately, we were able to get that
information for three states: Arizona, Oregon, and Pennsylvania.
Arizona and Oregon also provided additional information on the
conviction rate and the mean prison sentence length. However, for
Oregon, because the sentence length variable is not directly
comparable over time, it is interacted with all the year dummies so
that we can still retain any cross-sectional information in the
data. One difficulty with the Arizona prison sentence and
conviction data is that they are available only from 1990 to 1995
and that since the shall issue handgun law did not take effect
until July 1994, it is not possible for us to control for all the
other variables that we control for in the other regressions.
Unlike Oregon and Pennsylvania, Arizona did not allow private
citizens to carry concealed handguns prior to July 1994, so the
value of concealed handgun permits equals zero for this earlier
period. Unfortunately, however, because Arizona's change in the law
is so recent, we are unable to control for all the variables that
we can control for in the other regressions.</p>

<p>The results in Table 14 for Pennsylvania and Table 15 for Oregon
provide a couple of consistent patterns. The most economically and
statistically important relationship involves the arrest rate:
higher arrest rates consistently imply lower crime rates, and in 12
of the 16 regressions the effect is statistically significant. Five
cases for Pennsylvania (violent crime, murder, aggravated assault,
robbery, and burglary) show that arrest rates explain more than 20
percent of a standard deviation change in crime rates. Automobile
theft is the only crime for which the arrest rate is insignificant
in both tables.</p>

<p>For Pennsylvania, rape is the one crime where a one standard
deviation change in per capita concealed handgun permits explains a
greater percentage of a standard deviation in crime rates than it
does for the arrest rate. However, increased concealed handguns
usage explains more than 10 percent of a standard deviation change
in murder, rape, aggravated assualt, and burglary rates. For six of
the nine regressions, the concealed handgun variable for
Pennsylvania exhibits the same coefficient signs that were shown
for the national data. Violent crimes, with the exception of
robbery, show that higher concealed handgun use significantly
lowers crime rates, while property crimes exhibit the opposite
tendency. However, concealed handgun use only explains about half
the variation for property crimes that it explains for violent
ones.[36] The regressions for Oregon weakly imply a similar
relationship between concealed handgun use and crime, but the
effect is only statistically significant in one case: larceny,
which is also the only crime category where the negative concealed
handgun coefficient differs from our previous findings.</p>

<p>The Oregon data also show that higher conviction rates
consistently result in significantly lower crime rates. A one
standard deviation change in conviction rates explains 4 to 20
percent of a one standard deviation change in the corresponding
crime rates. However, increases in conviction rates appear to
produce a smaller deterrent effect than increases in arrest rates
for five of the seven crime categories.[37] The biggest differences
between the deterrence effects of arrest and conviction rates
produce an interesting pattern. For rape, increasing the arrest
rate by one percentage point produces more than ten times the
deterrent effect of increasing the conviction rate conditional on
arrest by one percent. The reverse is true for auto theft where a
one percentage point increase in reduces crime by about ten times
more than the same increase in convictions. These results are
consistent with arrests producing large shaming or reputational
penalties (e.g., see Kahan 1996). In fact, the existing evidence
shows that the reputational penalties from arrest and conviction
can dwarf the other legally imposed penalties (Lott, 1992a and b).
However, while the literature has not separated out whether these
drops are occurring due to arrest or conviction, these results are
consistent with the reputational penalties for arrests alone being
significant for at least some crimes.</p>

<p>The results for the prison sentences are not shown, but the
t-statistics are frequently near zero and the coefficients indicate
no clear pattern. One possible explanation for this result is that
all the changes in sentencing rules produced a great deal of noise
in this variable not only over time but also across counties. For
example, after 1989 whether a crime was prosecuted under the pre or
post 1989 rules depended upon when the crime took place. If the
average time between when the offense occurred and when the
prosecution took place differs across counties, the recorded prison
sentence length could vary even if the actual time served was the
same.</p>

<p>Finally, the much more limited data set for Arizona used in
Table 16 produces no significant relationship between the change in
concealed handgun permits and the various measures of crime rates.
In fact, the coefficient signs themselves indicate no consistent
pattern with the fourteen coefficients being equally divided
between negative and positive signs, though six of the
specfications imply that a one standard deviation change in the
concealed handgun permits explains at least 8 percent of a one
standard deviation change in the corresponding crime rates. The
results involving either the mean prison sentence length for those
sentenced in a particular year or the actual time served for those
ending their sentences also imply no consistent relationship
between prison and crime rates. While the coefficients are negative
in 11 of the 14 specifications, they provide weak evidence of the
deterrent effect of longer prison terms: only two coefficients are
negative and statistically significant.</p>

<p>Overall, the Pennsylvania results provide more evidence that
concealed handgun ownership reduces violent crime, murder, rape,
aggravated assault, and burglary; and in the case of Oregon larceny
decreases as well. While the Oregon data implies that the change in
handgun permits is statistically significant at .11 percent level
for a one-tailed t-test, the point estimate is extremely large
economically: implying that a doubling of permits reduces murder
rates by 37 percent. The other coefficients for Pennsylvania and
Oregon imply no significant relationship between the change in
concealed handgun ownership and crime rates. The evidence from the
small sample for Arizona implies no relationship between crime and
concealed handgun ownership. All the results also support the claim
that higher arrest and conviction rates deter crime, though,
possibly in part due to the relatively poor quality of the data, no
systematic effect appears to occur from longer prison
sentences.</p>

<h2>V. Accidental Deaths from Handguns</h2>

<p>Even if "shall issue" hand gun permits lower murder rates, the
question of what happens to accidental deaths still remains.
Possibly, with more people carrying handguns, accidents may be more
likely to happen. Earlier we saw that the number of murders
prevented exceeded the entire number of accidental deaths. As Table
2 showed, while only a small portion of either accidental deaths
are attributable to handgun laws, there is still the question
whether concealed handgun laws affected the total number of deaths
through their effect on accidental deaths.</p>

<p>To get a more precise answer to this question, Table 17 uses
county level data from 1982 to 1991 to test whether allowing
concealed handguns increased accidental deaths. Data are available
from the Mortality Detail Records (provided by the United States
Department of Health and Human Services) for all counties from 1982
to 1988 and for counties over 100,000 population from 1989 to 1991.
The specifications are identical to those shown in all the previous
tables with the exceptions that we no longer include variables
related to arrest or conviction rates and that the endogenous
variables are replaced with either a measure of the number of
accidental deaths from handguns or accidental deaths from all other
nonhandgun sources.</p>

<p>While there is some evidence that the racial composition of the
population and the level of income maintenance payments affect
accident rates, the coefficient of the shall issue dummy is both
quite small economically and insignificant. The point estimates for
the first specification implies that accidental handgun deaths rose
by about .5 percent when concealed handgun laws were passed. With
only 156 accidental handgun deaths occurring in counties over
100,000 population (27 accidental handgun deaths occurred in states
with "shall issue" laws), this point estimate implies that
implementing a concealed handgun law in those states which
currently do not have it would produce less than one more death
(.645 deaths).</p>

<p>Given the very small number of accidental handgun deaths in the
United States, the vast majority of counties have an accidental
handgun death rate of zero and thus using ordinary least squares is
not the appropriate method of estimating these relationships. To
deal with this, the last two columns in Table 17 reestimate these
specifications using Tobit procedures. However, because of
limitations in statistical packages we were no longer able to
control for all the county dummies and opted to rerun these
regressions with only state dummy variables. While the coefficients
for the concealed handgun law dummy variable is not statistically
significant, with 186 million people living in states without these
laws in 1992,[38] the third specification implies that implementing
the law across those remaining states would have resulted in about
9 more accidental handgun deaths. Combining this finding with the
earlier estimates from Tables 3 and 4, if the rest of the country
had adopted concealed handgun laws in 1992, the net reduction in
total deaths would have been approximately 1,561 to 1,767.</p>

<h2>VI. Conclusion</h2>

<p>Allowing citizens without criminal records or histories of
significant mental illness to carry concealed handguns deters
violent crimes and appears to produce an extremely small and
statistically insignificant change in accidental deaths. If the
rest country had adopted right-to-carry concealed handgun
provisions in 1992, at least 1,570 murders and over 4,177 rapes
would have been avoided. On the other hand, consistent with the
notion that criminals respond to incentives, county level data
provides evidence that concealed handgun laws are associated with
increases in property crimes involving stealth and where the
probability of contact between the criminal and the victim are
minimal. The largest population counties where the deterrence
effect on violent crimes is the greatest is also where the
substitution effect into these property crimes is the highest. The
estimated annual gain in 1992 from allowing concealed handguns was
over $6.21 billion.</p>

<p>The data also supply dramatic evidence supporting the economic
notion of deterrence. Higher arrest and conviction rates
consistently and dramatically reduce the crime rate. Consistent
with other recent work (Kahan, 1996 and Lott, 1992b), the results
imply that increasing the arrest rate, independent of the
probability of eventual conviction, imposes a significant penalty
on criminals. Perhaps the most surprising result is that the
deterrence effect of a one percentage point increase in arrest
rates is much larger than the same increase in the probability of
conviction. Also surprising was that while longer prison lengths
usually implied lower crime rates, the results were normally not
statistically significant.</p>

<p>This study incorporates a number of improvements over previous
studies on deterrence, and it represents a very large change in how
gun studies have been done. This is the first study to use
cross-sectional time-series evidence for counties at both the
national level and for individual states. Instead of simply using
cross-sectional state or city level data, our study has made use of
the much bigger variations in arrest rates and crime rates between
rural and urban areas, and it has been possible to control for
whether the lower crime rates resulted from the gun laws themselves
or other differences in these areas (e.g., low crime rates) which
lead to the adoption of these laws. Equally importantly, our study
has allowed us to examine what effect concealed handgun laws have
on different counties even within the same state. The evidence
indicates that the effect varies both with a county's level of
crime and its population.</p>

<h1>Data Appendix</h1>

<p>The number of arrests and offenses for each crime in every
county from 1977-1992 were provided by the Uniform Crime Report.
The UCR Program is a nationwide, cooperative statistical effort of
over 16,000 city, county and state law enforcement agencies to
compile data on crimes that are reported to them. During 1993, law
enforcement agencies active in the UCR Program represented over 245
million U.S. inhabitants, or 95% of the total population. The
coverage amounted to 97% of the U.S. population living in
Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) and 86% of the population in
non-MSA cities and in rural counties.[39] The Uniform Crime Reports
Supplementary Homicide Reports supplied the data on the victim's
sex and race and whatever relationship might have existed between
the victim andthe offender.[40]</p>

<p>The regressions report results from a subset of the UCR data
set, though we also ran the regressions with the entire data set.
The main differences were that the effect of concealed handgun laws
on murder were greater than what is shown in this paper and the
effects on rape and aggravated assult were smaller. Observations
were eliminated because of changes in reporting practices or
definitions of crimes (see Crime in the United States (1977 to
1992)). For example, from 1985 to 1994 Illinois adopted a unique
"gender-neutral" definition of sex offenses. Another example
involves Cook county, Illinois from 1981 to 1984 where there was a
large jump in reported crime because there was a change in the way
officers were trained to report crime. The additional observations
droped from the data set include: Florida (1988 to 1992); Georgia
(1980); Kentucky (1988); Hawaii (1982); Iowa (1991); Oakland, Ca.
(1991 to 1992). The counties with the following cities were also
eliminated: aggravated assult for Steubenville, OH. (1977 to 1990);
aggravated assult for Youngstown, OH (1977 to 1988); aggravated
assult and burglary for Mobile, Al. (1977 to 1985); aggravated
assult for Milwaukee, WI (1977 to 1985); Glendale, AZ (1977 to
1984); aggravated assult for Jackson, MS (1982 and 1983);
aggravated assult for Aurora, CO (1982 and 1983); aggravated assult
for Beaumont, TX (1982 and 1983); aggravated assult for Corpus
Cristi, TX (1982 and 1983); rape for Macon, GA (1977 to 1981);
robbery and larceny for Cleveland, OH (1977 to 1981); aggravated
assult for Omaha, NE (1977 to 1981); Little Rock, Ark. (1977 to
1979); burglary and larceny for Eau Claire, WI (1977 to 1978);
Green Bay, WI. (1977); and Fort Worth, TX (1977). For all of the
different crime rates, if the true rate equals zero, we added .1
before we took the natural log of those values. For the accident
rates, if the true rate equals zero, we added .01 before we took
the natural log of those values.[41]</p>

<p>The number of police in a state, which of those police have the
power to make arrests, and police payrolls for a state by type of
police officer are available for 1982 to 1992 from the U.S.
Department of Justice's Expenditure and Employment Data for the
Criminal Justice System.</p>

<p>The data on age, sex and racial distributions estimate the
population in each county on July 1 of the respective years. The
population is divided into five year segments and race is
categorized as white, black and neither white nor black. The
population data, with the exception of 1990 and 1992, were obtained
from the Bureau of the Census.[42] The estimates use modified
census data as anchor points and then employ an iterative
proportional fitting technique to estimate intercensal populations.
The process ensures that the county level estimates are consistent
with estimates of July 1 national and state populations by age,
sex, and race. The age distributions of large military
installations, colleges, and institutions were estimated by a
separate procedure. The counties for which special adjustments were
made are listed in the report.[43] The 1990 and 1992 estimates have
not yet been completed by the Bureau of the Census and made
available for distribution. We estimated the 1990 data by taking an
average of the 1989 and 1991 data. We estimated the 1992 data by
multiplying the 1991 populations by the 1990-1991 growth rate of
each county's populations.</p>

<p>Data on income, unemployment, income maintenance and retirement
were obtained by the Regional Economic Information System (REIS).
Income maintenance includes Supplemental Security Insurance (SSI),
Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), and food stamps.
Unemployment benefits include state unemployment insurance
compensation, Unemployment for Federal Employees, unemployment for
railroad employees, and unemployment for veterans. Retirement
payments include old age survivor and disability payments, federal
civil employee retirement payments, military retirement payments,
state and local government employee retirement payments, and
workers compensation payments (both federal and state). Nominal
values were converted to real values by using the consumer price
index.[44] The index uses the average consumer price index for July
1983 as the base period.</p>

<p>Data concerning the number of concealed weapons permits for each
county were obtained from a variety of sources. The Pennsylvania
data were obtained from Alan Krug. Mike Woodward of the Oregon Law
Enforcement and Data System provided the Oregon data for 1991 and
after. The number of permits available for Oregon by county in 1989
was provided by the sheriffs departments of the individual
counties. Cari Gerchick, Deputy County Attorney for Maricopa County
in Arizona, provided us with the Arizona county level conviction
rates, prison sentence lengths, and concealed handgun permits from
1990 to 1995. The National Rifle Association provided data on NRA
membership by state from 1977 to 1992. Information on the dates at
which states enacted enhanced sentencing provisions for crimes
committed with deadly weapons was obtained from Marvell and Moody
(1995, pp. 259-260). The first year where the dummy variable comes
on is weighted by the portion of that first year that the law was
in effect.</p>

<p>The Bureau of the Census provided data on the latitude,
longitude and area in square kilometers for each county. The number
of total and firearm unintentional injury deaths was obtained from
annual issues of Accident Facts and The Vital Statistics of the
United States. The classification of types of weapons is in
International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related
Health Problems, Tenth Edition, Volume 1. The handgun category
includes guns for single hand use, pistols and revolvers. The total
includes all other types of firearms.</p>
