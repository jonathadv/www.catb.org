<h1 class="c1">Guns and Me</h1>

<p>From age twelve I always wanted to be a Heinlein character when
I grew up. So I always knew I'd have to get around to learning how
to use firearms someday. Also (partly as a result of early Heinlein
exposure) I'm a libertarian with strong gun-rights convictions, and
I've felt vaguely like a hypocrite for years not being armed
myself. I finally got off my butt about this in early 1997, and
have since discovered that I truly enjoy playing with guns.</p>

<p>Before picking up a weapon I took the NRA's safety and handling
course. While I believe everybody has an inalienable right to be
armed for self-defense, ignorance and unsafe gun-handling can kill
you. Don't play stupid!</p>

<p>Before acquiring my own heat, I shot at targets with S&amp;W .38
Special and .357 Magnum revolvers, a .44 Magnum single-action
revolver, a S&amp;W 9313 9mm semiauto, a Firestar .40 semiauto, a
very odd pistol/SMG hybrid called a Calico, and a Colt .45 ACP. For
comfort and accuracy I found the 9313 the best of the bunch, a
sweet dream to shoot. But having done my homework, I'm partial to
the big-slow-bullet theory of stopping power. And it happened that
the first time I fired a .45 I scored a 30-foot bull's-eye, and
that I was shortly afterward offered the opportunity to buy that
same weapon. I jumped at it.</p>

<p>So my personal arm is a Colt M1991A Officer's Model
semiautomatic pistol, the small-frame six-shot 3-5/8"-barrel
version of the classic .45 ACP design. It's small enough to conceal
but has excellent stopping power. Mine has a matte-black Parkerized
finish, Pachmayr wraparound diamond-scale grips, and definitely
looks like something you would not want to be staring down the
business end of.</p>

<p>To my pleasure (and somewhat to my surprise when I started), I
am a fairly good shot. At twenty-one feet, shooting my .45
two-handed from either Weaver or isosceles stance, I can reliably
put a clip through the palm-sized heart area of a human-silhouette
target, or I can call head shots and make them. At thirty feet, or
shooting one-handed either hand, I've almost never missed the
torso.</p>

<p>I attribute this to having trained in Tae Kwon Do for seven
years before I started. The state of mind necessary to shoot
accurately is the same combat no-mind you need to take into the
sparring ring. And the training helps me maintain the upper-body
strength to hold a steady sight picture with a .45 while staying
fairly relaxed.</p>

<p>I'm hoping to get into tactical shooting, the kind of
pistol-combat simulation the <a
href="http://www.idpa.com">International Defensive Pistol
Association</a> does. This seems like it would be much more fun
than stationary targets, which are beginning to seem too easy.</p>

<p>I bought my wife Cathy a Smith and Wesson Model 60 for her 1997
birthday (she'd taken the NRA course right along with me). This is
a small-frame, five-shot alloy revolver with a bobbed hammer,
designed for concealed carry. It's magnaported for recoil
compensation.</p>

<p>There's a good story in that. Cathy and I weren't yet married
when we started shooting, so when we went to Chester County
Courthouse to apply for our marriage license, we had one other
piece of unfinished business. So we exited the inner section of the
courthouse each carrying two forms. The guards at the door, having
worked there for years, of course instantly recognized the other
form in Cathy's hand as an application for concealed carry
permit.</p>

<p>One of the guards looks at me, looks at Cathy, looks at the form
in her hand, looks at me, looks at the form, sidles up to me, puts
a hand on my shoulder and murmurs loudly "You know...it's not too
late to back out."</p>

<p>Good thing I like tough-minded women, eh?</p>

shoot</a>.</p>
