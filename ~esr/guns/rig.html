<h1 class="c1">My Shooting Rig</h1>

<p><img align="right" src="officer2.png"
alt="The Officer's Model Colt" /> My personal arm is a <a
href="http://www.m1911.org/mod_colt.htm">Colt M1991A Officer's
Model</a> semiautomatic pistol, the small-frame six-shot
3-5/8"-barrel version of the classic .45 ACP design. It's small
enough to conceal but has excellent stopping power. Mine has a
matte-black Parkerized finish and Pachmayr wraparound diamond-scale
grips (unlike the OM in the image, which has stock grips).</p>

<p>Aside from the grips the gun is completely stock. I took it to a
buddy who's a gunsmith and FFL. He stripped it, gave it the
professional eyeball, put it back together, and said ``It's perfect
as is''. He was right, too. One day at the range I got a chance to
swap guns for a few mags with a guy with the same style OM who'd
gone the custom route; recoil rod, match bushing, custom trigger,
the works. Fifty rounds later neither of us was sure we could see
any performance difference at all.</p>

<p>I generally shoot plain-vanilla 230-grain copper-jacketed
hardball at the range, but load blue-tip Glaser rounds for home
defense. In case they fail to penetrate and I can't make a head
shot, the last round in the mag is hardball.</p>

<p>I use Shooting Star 7-shot mags in preference to the factory
Colt magazines, both to get the extra round of capacity and because
they seem better made and more reliable.</p>

<p>For the range and tac-shooting, I wear my gun in a <a
href="http://www.bianchi.com/bianchi2.html">Bianchi Speed
Scabbard</a>. This is a minimalist molded-leather outside-the-belt
holster designed for fast drawing. I use a different method for
serious concealment, about which however I shall keep mum because
there's a large class of criminals and gun-grabbers I'd rather keep
guessing.</p>

<p>When not on my person, the Colt lives in a <a
href="http://www.gunvault.com">GunVault</a>. These things are very
nice and quite reliable provided you don't get the battery
connector upside-down like I did first time!</p>
