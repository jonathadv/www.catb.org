translation of this paper is available.)</p><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id266453"></a>Introduction</h2></div></div></div><p>The Open Source Initiative (OSI) is a 501(c)3 nonprofit
educational association with offices in Palo Alto, California.  OSI is
one of the principal advocacy organizations of the open-source
community, which is alleged in SCO/Caldera's complaint to have been
beneficiary of tortious and illegal behavior by IBM.</p><p>The principal author of this position paper (Raymond) has been a Unix
developer since 1982, is a technical specialist in systems programming
technologies related to those at issue, and is a historian whose writings
on the open-source community and Unix (<a href="#TNHD" title="The New Hacker's Dictionary">[TNHD]</a>,
<a href="#CATB" title="The Cathedral and the Bazaar">[CATB]</a>, <a href="#TAOUP" title="The Art of Unix Programming">[TAOUP]</a>)
are widely considered authoritative both within the community and outside
it.  He has been since 1997 one of the leading theorists and (both in his
individual capacity and as co-founder and first President of OSI) one of
the principal spokespersons/ambassadors for the open-source
community.</p><p>While the authors are affiliated with the Linux community, our
argument is also motivated by larger concerns. Unix, Linux, and the
open-source movement are vital components of the Internet and the 
World Wide Web.  SCO/Caldera's attempt to assert proprietary control of
these technologies is an indirect but potent threat against the 
Internet and the culture that maintains it.  What is at stake here
is not just the disposition of a particular volume of computer 
code, but what amounts to a power grab against the future.</p><p>This document, originally proposed as a draft brief of amicus
curiae, has been endorsed as an OSI position paper by OSI's Board of
Directors.  The Board has concluded on advice of counsel that OSI
cannot seek amicus status in advance of pleadings.  The option to 
seek amicus status at a future time remains open.</p><p>This document is an evolving <a href="#WIP" title="A. Work in Progress">work in
progress</a>.  SCO/Caldera's complaint against IBM disparaged the work
of thousands of individual open-source contributors.  These contributors
feel themselves personally and professionally wronged by SCO/Caldera's
unfounded allegations.  In the tradition of the open-source movement,
hundreds of individuals are now sending in their patches to help inform and
evolve the OSI's position.</p><p><a name="modnote"></a>Note to persons who read the original Response paper:
though the amended complaint has changed substantially (as we cover below)
remarkably little in this paper had to be tweaked in order to cope with the
changes in SCO's story.  Most of the paragraphs we called out in the
original version have different numbers but the same content.  One
substantive change is that because the case is now in Federal rather than
state court, we can now <a href="#ip_theory">request a finding</a>
in some general IP-law issues relevant to this case, including confirming
the validity of the GPL.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id266544"></a>Scope of the position paper</h2></div></div></div><p>This position paper is written in specific response to SCO/Caldera's
amended complaint <sup>[<a name="id266552" href="#ftn.id266552">1</a>]</sup> filed on the 16th of June 2003.</p><p>It is not within OSI's competence or knowledge to address the
specifics of the business relationship between SCO/Caldera and IBM, or the
terms of their contract.  It is, however, very much within our
competence to observe that SCO/Caldera's complaint depends critically on
certain historical and technical assertions which are materially false
and (apparently quite intentionally) misleading.</p><p>Unlike SCO/Caldera's complaint, we have provided direct hyperlinks to
browseable versions of all the sources which back our facts.</p><p>In this position paper, we focus on the following allegations, and
show that they are incorrect or fundamentally misleading:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Paragraph 1.(c)</span></dt><dd><p>&#8220;<span class="quote">UNIX and SCO/UNIX are widely used in the
corporate, or &#8216;<span class="quote">enterprise</span>&#8217; computing environment.</span>&#8221;</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Paragraph 32</span></dt><dd><p>&#8220;<span class="quote">Most of the primary UNIX vendors identified above did
not attempt to develop a UNIX &#8220;flavor&#8221; to operate on an
Intel-based processor chip set.</span>&#8221;</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Paragraph 2.</span></dt><dd><p>&#8220;<span class="quote">
Through a series of corporate acquisitions, SCO presently owns all right,
title and interest in and to UNIX and UnixWare operating system source
code, software and sublicensing agreements, together with copyrights,
additional licensing rights in and to UNIX and UnixWare, and claims against
all parties breaching such agreements. Through agreements with UNIX
vendors, SCO controls the right of all UNIX vendors to use and distribute
UNIX.

enterprise customers, it needed to be re-designed and upgraded to
accommodate complex multi-processor functionality that has taken UNIX
nearly 20 years to achieve.  This re-design is not technologically feasible
or even possible at the enterprise level without (a) a high degree of
design coordination, (b) access to expensive and sophisticated design and
testing equipment; (c) access to UNIX code and development methods; (d)
UNIX architectural experience; and (e) a very significant financial
investment. The contributions of IBM, which had access to UNIX System V Protected Materials and years of enterprise level experience, made possible this rapid redesign of Linux for enterprise use.&#8220;<span class="quote"></span>&#8221;</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Paragraph 87:</span></dt><dd><p>&#8220;<span class="quote"> To accomplish the end of

&#8216;<span class="quote">eight-lane highway</span>&#8217; for Linux to achieve the
scalability, SMP support, fail-over capabilities and reliability of
UNIX is by the improper extraction, use, and dissemination of the
proprietary and confidential UNIX source code, derivative works, and methods.
Indeed, UNIX was able to achieve its status as the premiere operating
system only after decades of hard work, beginning with the finest
computer scientists at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, plaintiff's
predecessor in interest.  </span>&#8221;</p></dd></dl></div><p>OSI submits that these claims are uniformly without merit, and
proposes to establish that in the remainder of this position paper.</p><p>It is notable that the first and second amended complaints differ
substantially from the <a href="http://www.sco.com/scosource/complaint3.06.03.html" target="_top">original</a>;
SCO had to change its story because some of the falsehoods in the original
were too readily exposed. Where appropriate, we cite passages of the old
complaint to show the divergence.  (The relevant differences between the
first and second Amended Complaints amount to minor wording changes.)</p><p>Technically-inclined readers will probably wonder why various
apparently relevant topics (such as Minix, or the GNU project, or the Bell
Labs research versions, or other proprietary Unixes) are not covered.
Please remember that this document is not a tutorial in Unix history;
history that does not bear on SCO's allegations has been omitted.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id305445"></a>Historical and technical background</h2></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id305450"></a>The meaning of &#8216;Unix&#8217;</h3></div></div></div><p>The falseness of SCO/Caldera's allegations is partly cloaked by the
fact that their complaint uses the term &#8220;<span class="quote">Unix</span>&#8221; in three
different ways.</p><p>Among technical people and computer programmers, &#8220;<span class="quote">Unix</span>&#8221;
describes a family of computer operating systems with common design
elements, all patterned on (but not necessarily derivative works of) the
ancestral Unix invented at Bell Labs in 1969.  As SCO/Caldera observes in its
complaint, Unix operating systems dominate serious computing, and have for
more than twenty years.  There have been hundreds of different Unixes 
in this sense, exhibiting variations analogous to dialects within 
a language.  Fortunately, only a handful of the principal dialects
are relevant to this lawsuit.</p><p>When we wish to be clear that this is the definition we are using, we
will refer to &#8220;<span class="quote">Unix-family</span>&#8221; operating systems.  Use of the
term &#8216;Unix&#8217; to describe any Unix-family operating system was
common before SCO/Caldera's acquisition of the historical Unix codebase in
1995; AT&amp;T's lawyers strove against it in vain as far back as the early
1980s.  When we use the term &#8216;Unix&#8217; without qualification
elsewhere in this paper, this is the sense we intend.</p><p>The term &#8220;<span class="quote">Unix</span>&#8221; is sometimes also used (primarily by
historians of computing) more strictly, to describe only those Unix-family
operating systems which are derivative works of the original Bell Labs
Unix. To avoid confusion, we shall call any operating system of this kind a
&#8220;<span class="quote">genetic Unix</span>&#8221;.</p><p>Legally, the term &#8220;<span class="quote">Unix</span>&#8221; has been since October 1993 a
trademark of The Open Group<sup>[<a name="id305506" href="#ftn.id305506">2</a>]</sup>,
a technical standards organization, and describes any operating system
(whether genetic-Unix or not) that has been verified to conform to the
published Unix standard.  We will refer to an operating system of this
kind as a &#8220;<span class="quote">trademark Unix</span>&#8221;.  The required attribution is
&#8220;<span class="quote">UNIX is a registered trademark of The Open Group</span>&#8221;.
<sup>[<a name="id305547" href="#ftn.id305547">3</a>]</sup>
However, The Open Group's strict construction of the term
&#8220;<span class="quote">Unix</span>&#8221; is more honored in the breach than the
observance.</p><p>Neither SCO/Caldera nor old SCO has ever owned the UNIX trademark.
IBM neither requested nor required SCO's permission to call their AIX
offering a Unix.  That decision lies not with the adventitious owner of the
historical Bell Labs source code, but with The Open Group.</p><p>The Linux operating system is Unix-family and generally referred to
as a Unix, but is neither a genetic Unix nor a trademark Unix.  Linux was
independently created by Linus Torvalds in 1991<sup>[<a name="id305571" href="#ftn.id305571">4</a>]</sup>, and most versions have not been put
through the rather expensive process required to verify conformance with
The Open Group standards.</p><p>The name is spelled either as &#8216;Unix&#8217; or &#8217;UNIX&#8217;;
its inventors prefer the former.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="seismic"></a>Linux and the advent of open-source
programming</h3></div></div></div><p>SCO/Caldera's complaint cannot be understood without reference to a
seismic shift now occurring in the software industry.  The root of the
shift lies in the approximate doubling of hardware capacity every
eighteen months which has been the trend since the mid-1970s.  This
means that the typical complexity of software designed to fully
utilize state-of-the-art hardware also doubles every eighteen months,
escalating the difficulties of software engineering to previously
unimagined levels.</p><p>In the mid-1990s it began to be understood that the traditional
production models for software were running out of steam, increasingly
unable to produce an acceptably low defect rate at these escalating
complexity levels.  There was much talk of a &#8220;<span class="quote">software
crisis</span>&#8221; and attempts to resolve it through various
attempts at process improvement.</p><p>These attempts at process improvement consisted largely of
introducing more formality, rigor, centralization, and statistical
monitoring into the software-development process.  They had honorable
precedents in the systematization of assembly-line manufacturing and
industrial process control in the 20th century. But producing software
is not like producing automobiles or soap flakes.  The analogy to
industrial process control turned out to be fundamentally misleading,
and all these attempts failed, merely adding additional cost to the
process without reliably reducing defect rates.</p><p>Relief came from an unexpected quarter &#8212; from the
loose-knit community of programmers and engineers associated with the
Internet and the Unix operating system.  Since the 1960s, the Internet
and Unix hackers<sup>[<a name="id305629" href="#ftn.id305629">5</a>]</sup> had been pioneering a style of
software engineering which reversed the premises of industrial
software development.</p><p>Instead of centralization in large programming teams, the
Internet style used small distributed programming groups.  Instead of
process control and hierarchy, the Internet style used peer
review and open standards.  Most importantly, the Internet style
abolished secrecy in favor of transparency and what came to be
called &#8220;<span class="quote">open source</span>&#8221; code.</p><p>Early examples of this mode of development included Berkeley Unix
from about 1977, the GNU project from 1985, and the X Consortium from 1983.
All three flourished within the Unix community.  When Linus Torvalds launched
Linux in 1991 he was operating within a well-established tradition.</p><p>To the surprise of all concerned, after about 1997 it became apparent
that this was the answer (or, at least, an important part of the answer)
that the software industry had been looking for.  Defect rates and costs
associated with open-source software proved dramatically lower than for
closed-source software<sup>[<a name="id305655" href="#ftn.id305655">6</a>]</sup>.  The most skilled programmers
flocked to the new mode.  The explosive success of Linux, and IBM's
adoption of it, is a consequence of the dynamism of open-source
development. Caldera Systems International itself, the company now trading
as SCO, was founded to ride the Linux wave.</p><p>We did not, however, use the term &#8220;<span class="quote">seismic shift</span>&#8221;
casually.  As with previous technological revolutions, one of the
prompt effects has been what the economist Joseph Schumpeter famously 
called &#8220;<span class="quote">creative destruction</span>&#8221;  &#8212; to wreck the
business models of a great many companies attached to the legacy 
model of closed-source development.</p><p>The evolution of today's software industry is confusing to many
people because it is proceeding in exactly the opposite direction from
previous technological revolutions.  Previously, the rationalization
of production has been associated with movement away from
decentralized cottage industry towards a factory system organized
around concentrations of capital. This time, the move is away from the
factory system, towards a new form of artisanship and individualism
critically enabled by cheap PCs and the Internet.  Thus, Linux.</p><p>This process panics companies like SCO/Caldera and
Microsoft<sup>[<a name="id305705" href="#ftn.id305705">7</a>]</sup> who
stand to lose everything if they fail to adapt, but it should not be viewed
with alarm by any disinterested observer.  What is actually happening is
that the diseconomies of corporate scale are being competed out of software
production &#8212; the market is seeking a new and more efficient
equilibrium.</p><p>SCO/Caldera's complaint is only a small piece of the fallout.  There 
will be a lot more upheaval, and wailing and gnashing of teeth and 
waving of legal briefs, before this process fully resolves.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id305720"></a>The Bell Labs codebase</h3></div></div></div><p>There is a body of code and associated intellectual property
(IP), originating in Bell Labs, which old SCO purchased from Novell in
1995.  This IP had previously been owned by Unix Systems Laboratories
(USL), and before that by AT&amp;T.  We will refer to this IP by its
location of origin, as the Bell Labs code.</p><p>The contents of the historical Bell Labs codebase is well known;
through most of its history, AT&amp;T/USL/Novell tacitly ignored source
license violations for non-commercial purposes, and many senior Unix
programmers still possess bootleg copies of that source code.  (The authors
of this document could lay hands on several different releases without
difficulty.)  It is scarcely more difficult to obtain source copies of
other major genetic Unixes such as AIX, HP-UX, and Solaris.  The contents
of these codebases, and the general pattern of copyrights and other
intellectual-property claims in the source code, is therefore well known in
the Unix community.</p><p>Until 19 May 2003, two full months after filing its complaint,
SCO/Caldera and old SCO before it made the Version 5, Version 6, Version 7,
32V, and System III versions of the Unix source code available for free
download on its website<sup>[<a name="id305752" href="#ftn.id305752">8</a>]</sup>.
In fact, those sources are still available for entirely legal free download
if you know where to look; we refrain from giving the location publicly
only so that SCO's lawyers will not be able to harass the site with the
odious and illegal threats they would otherwise undoubtedly bring to
bear.</p><p>It is significant that SCO/Caldera has not asserted any direct IP
claim over Linux on the basis of its ownership of the historical Bell Labs
code.  At best, ownership of the Bell Labs code could be construed to give
SCO/Caldera certain proprietary rights with respect to genetic Unixes.
Those rights are far more limited than SCO/Caldera would have one assume, a
point which we will develop later in this position paper.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id305775"></a>Relationships among the Unix variants at issue</h3></div></div></div><p>Here is a schematic diagram of the relationships among the Unix

AT&amp;T itself, then Unix Systems Laboratories (USL), then Novell, then
old SCO, now SCO/Caldera.</p><p>The early releases in this lineage (Version 7, System III, System V
releases 1 through 3, and ending with Release 4 in 1988) were developed
at AT&amp;T itself<sup>[<a name="id305850" href="#ftn.id305850">10</a>]</sup> and are

AT&amp;T Unixes) are two different products of SCO.  XENIX was old SCO's
original Unix (cyan on the chart).  After 1985 XENIX was replaced by SCO
OpenServer, a SCO in-house port of System Vr4/386 (brown on the
chart). UnixWare was what SCO picked up when it bought the AT&amp;T
codebase.  For some years after the AT&amp;T acquisition, SCO positioned
OpenServer as their low-end and UnixWare as their high-end product.  The
dashed arrow between OpenServer and UnixWare 7 reflects the fact that the
latter was a product designed to merge OpenServer 5 with UnixWare 2 (5 + 2
= 7).</p><p>The dashed red arrow from 4.2BSD to System V represents stolen property.
AT&amp;T, SCO/Caldera's predecessor in interest, took code from BSD Unix into
System V, removing copyright notices and attributions in violation of the
Berkeley license. We'll examine the consequences of this misappropriation
later on.</p><p>The blue arrow from UnixWare 7 to AIX 5L represents code
incorporated into AIX from UnixWare 7 during the Monterey project.
SCO/Caldera alleges that IBM misappropriated this code and merged it into
Linux, as represented by the dotted blue arrow.</p><p>The arrow from the open-source BSDs to Linux 2.0 represents sharing
of some device drivers and system utilities.</p><p>There is another major variant, Solaris, not shown on the chart.
Solaris enters the discussion because it is the leading enterprise-capable
proprietary Unix; its features therefore provide a standard upon which to
ground assertions about which technologies fall under that rubric.  It
derives from System V and BSD.  As of mid-2003 it is still the dominant
Unix in the enterprise market (sold in conjunction with server hardware by
Sun Microsystems).  Genetic Unix, trademark Unix, proprietary.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id305987"></a>Corporate history</h3></div></div></div><p>In 1956, AT&amp;T settled an antitrust action brought by the United

SCO, was founded as an open-source centered company by a group of former
Novell executives who were enthusiastic about Linux.  Its only product was
a Linux distribution.  Caldera Linux was not a market success, however.  It
became an also-ran in the commercial Linux distribution market dominated by
Red Hat (a North Carolina corporation) and SuSE (a German import).  In
mid-2002 co-founder president and CEO Ransom Love was pushed out during the
shakeup that accompanied Caldera's acquisition of old SCO's server
division.</p><p>Old SCO, prior to its acquisition by Caldera, did not produce its
own Linux distribution, but became involved in open-source
development between 1998 and 2000.  It invested in Caldera and TurboLinux,
bought out a popular on-line store called LinuxMall, and boasted of
offering more open-source and Unix expertise than anyone else in the
world.</p><p>In a press release at the time of the Project Monterey
launch<sup>[<a name="id306378" href="#ftn.id306378">30</a>]</sup>,
Doug Michels (the co-founder of old SCO who remained at its head until
Caldera Systems International acquired the brand in 2001) had this to say:
&#8220;<span class="quote">The whole idea of shared development has been ubiquitous in Unix for
years. The Internet has magnified that and open source is bringing
collaborative development to a new level.</span>&#8221; He observed, correctly,
that it would be important for Unix vendors to continue their embrace of
the open-source community, most notably Linux.  At that time, SCO got
it.</p><p>In a web page from 2000 <sup>[<a name="id306397" href="#ftn.id306397">31</a>]</sup>,
(since removed from their site) old SCO repeated this theme: &#8220;<span class="quote">The
concept of collaborative development and shared source has been ubiquitous
in the UNIX system industry from the beginning. Today, the Internet has
magnified that trend dramatically and led to the exciting phenomenon that
is Linux.</span>&#8221;</p><p>Between the time Caldera acquired SCO in 2001 and early 2003,
SCO/Caldera continued to trumpet its commitment to Linux and boast
of its plans to merge leading-edge Linux technology into its UnixWare 
source code.  This reflected the market reality that the UnixWare code 
base was generally perceived to be old, tired, and out of date.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id306419"></a>The meaning of &#8220;<span class="quote">enterprise scalability</span>&#8221;</h3></div></div></div><p>SCO/Caldera uses the term &#8220;<span class="quote">enterprise computing</span>&#8221; and

about SCO/Caldera's business and technical capabilities that are untrue.  It
is, indeed, very cleverly crafted to deceive a reader without intimate
knowledge of the technology and history of Unix; it gives false
impressions by both the suppression of relevant facts, the ambiguous
suggestion of falsehoods, and in a few instances by outright lying.</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id306544"></a>SCO/Caldera's claim to have been a significant enterprise
player is false</h3></div></div></div><p>SCO/Caldera's attempts to confuse the issues in this complaint begin
early, in Paragraph 1.(c) where it asserts: <span class="emphasis"><em>&#8220;<span class="quote">UNIX and
SCO/UNIX are widely used in the corporate, or
&#8216;<span class="quote">enterprise</span>&#8217; computing
environment.</span>&#8221;</em></span></p><p>While this claim is literally true, it is misleading in that it
fails to distinguish between the market share of old SCO's own Unixes (SCO
OpenServer and Unixware) and those of competitors such as Sun,
Hewlett-Packard, and IBM.  By failing to so distinguish, it conveys
the impression that old SCO's market share in the enterprise segment was
significant, thus magnifying the putative harm done by IBM's
alleged misconduct.</p><p>The truth is otherwise. Old SCO never had significant enterprise
market share either before or after its purchase of the Bell Labs codebase
from Novell.  Their strength has been in franchise operations including
McDonald's, Burger King, Pizza Hut, and Ground Round, which involve lots of
parallel small deployments with no individual site requiring enterprise
technology.</p><p>Examination of old SCO's 10Ks reveals that, even were we to assume that
every dime of their revenue came from the enterprise market, their 2002
share could not have exceeded 3.1%<sup>[<a name="id306578" href="#ftn.id306578">32</a>]</sup>. This is at the level of statistical noise.</p><p>In fact, SCO/Caldera's own complaint concedes that its historical
strength has been in low-end systems used by small businesses.  The
principal author did SCO Unix consulting in the early 1990s, configuring
systems for a small-town police station and a dental practice; anyone
familiar with the industry would recognize that these were entirely typical
old SCO deployments. And SCO/Caldera's most recent 10K
<sup>[<a name="id306617" href="#ftn.id306617">33</a>]</sup>
states, in part &#8220;<span class="quote">Our business is focused on serving the needs of
small businesses, including replicated site franchisees of Fortune 1000
companies<sup>[<a name="id306630" href="#ftn.id306630">34</a>]</sup>, to have reliable, cost effective Linux and
Unix operating systems and software products to power computers running on
Intel architecture.</span>&#8221;</p><p>Conspicuously absent in SCO/Caldera's most recent mission statement
is any talk of 16-way servers or enterprise data centers. In fact, SCO's
history of non-performance in the enterprise market is not only consistent
from long before the beginning of IBM's involvement with Linux in
1999-2000, it predates the 1991 origin of Linux itself. SCO/Caldera's claim
that IBM's behavior with regard to improving Linux's enterprise scalability
did it harm should be evaluated in the light of the failure of both
incarnations of SCO, over more than a decade before that, to even seriously
<span class="emphasis"><em>attempt</em></span> to be competitive in the enterprise
market.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="inflates"></a>SCO/Caldera inflates its importance as an Intel Unix vendor</h3></div></div></div><p>In paragraph 32 SCO/Caldera writes &#8220;<span class="quote">Most of the primary UNIX

operate on an Intel-based processor chip set.</span>&#8221;</p><p>The old version was flat-out false; the new is merely misleading.
Sun Microsystems is a primary Unix vendor by anyone's definition, and their
Solaris operating system was ported to the Intel 386 and sold on that
platform.  IBM's AIX was also ported to the 386 in 1987 and sold until
1995<sup>[<a name="id306682" href="#ftn.id306682">35</a>]</sup>.</p><p>Both versions of the complaint misleadingly imply that Unix was not
generally available on PCs other than from old SCO.  But, in fact, AT&amp;T

breaching such agreements. Through agreements with UNIX vendors, SCO
controls the right of all UNIX vendors to use and distribute UNIX.
</span>&#8221;</em></span></p><p>SCO/Caldera neglects to mention that those rights had been
substantially impaired before its acquisition of the ancestral Bell Labs
source code.  There was a legal action in 1992-1993, in which Unix Systems
Laboratories and Novell (SCO/Caldera's predecessors in interest) sued
various parties including the University of California at Berkeley and
Berkeley Systems Design, Inc. for alleged copyright infringement, trade
secret disclosures, and trademark violations with regard to the release of
substantial portions of the 4.4BSD operating system<sup>[<a name="id306802" href="#ftn.id306802">39</a>]</sup>.</p><p>The suit was settled after AT&amp;T's request for an injunction
blocking distribution of BSD was denied in terms that made it clear the
judge thought BSD likely to win its defense.  The University of California
then threatened to countersue over license violations by AT&amp;T and USL.
It seems that from as far back as before System V Release 4 in 1985, the
historical Bell Labs codebase had been incorporating large amounts of
software from the BSD sources. The University's cause of action lay in the
fact that AT&amp;T, USL and Novell had routinely violated the terms of the
BSD license by removing license attributions and copyrights.</p><p>The exact terms of final settlement, and much of the judicial record,
were sealed at Novell's insistence.  The key provisions are, however,
described in <em class="citetitle">Twenty Years of Berkeley Unix: From AT&amp;T-Owned
to Freely Redistributable</em>, <a href="#McKusick99" title="???TITLE???">[McKusick99]</a>.  The settlement itself was
unsealed in November 2004 under the terms of the California Public Records
Act (California Code § 6250-6270) and is on-line at <a href="http://www.groklaw.net/pdf/USLsettlement.pdf" target="_top">Groklaw</a>. Only
three files out of eighteen thousand in the distribution were found to be
the licit property of Novell (and removed).  The rest were ruled to be
freely redistributable, and continue to form the basis of the open-source
BSD distributions today.</p><p>Ten years ago &#8212; at a time when Linux was in its infancy &#8212;
the courts already found the contributions of other parties to what is
now UnixWare to be so great, and Novell's proprietary entitlement in
the code so small, that Novell's lawyers had to settle for a minor,
face-saving gesture from the University of California or walk away
with nothing at all.</p><p>This history is well-known in the open-source community, and helps
explain why SCO/Caldera's claim that ownership of the historical Bell Labs
code gives it substantial rights over other Unixes such as AIX is regarded
among old Unix hands with near-universal disdain.  Some of the court
documents, including the 1993 ruling, are now available on the web
<sup>[<a name="id306863" href="#ftn.id306863">40</a>]</sup>.</p><p>If, as SCO/Caldera says, it inherited AT&amp;T/USL/Novell's rights to
Unix, it also inherited the <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">res
judicata</em></span> that there are many sources of code and
engineering experience in the Unix design tradition entirely
independent of AT&amp;T/USL/Novell's intellectual property.  And that,
seven years before IBM's behavior with respect to AIX and Linux became
an issue, AT&amp;T/USL/Novell's proprietary stake in at least one
leading-edge Unix was already so diluted in comparison with the
contributions it had received from elsewhere that said stake could
scarcely be said to exist at all.</p><p>SCO/Caldera would, for understandable reasons, prefer that the courts
remain ignorant of the history, outcome, and implications of the BSD
lawsuit.  But, of course, it bears directly on SCO/Caldera's claim in
Paragraph 91: <span class="emphasis"><em>&#8220;<span class="quote">Rather, IBM is obligated not to open source
AIX because it contains SCO's confidential and proprietary UNIX source
code, derivative works, modifications and methods.</span>&#8221;</em></span></p><p>The implied theory here is that &#8220;<span class="quote">SCO's confidential and
proprietary UNIX source code, derivative works, modifications and
methods</span>&#8221; encompasses the entirety, or at least a preponderance, of
the AIX code, including those portions related to enterprise scalability
issues; and that SCO/Caldera therefore may exercise <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">ex post
facto</em></span> control, even for anti-competitive purposes, over
IBM's use of Unix in its normal course of business.</p><p>In fact, SCO/Caldera's complaint relies on confusing two separate
scopes of control. One: those rights entailed in SCO/Caldera's ownership of
the SCO OpenServer codebase.  Two: putative rights entailed in SCO's
ownership of the historical Bell Labs source code (Unixware).  (The
original and first amended versions of the complaint confused both of these
with a third scope, those rights that pertain to certain SCO shared
libraries mentioned in paragraph 36 and following of the complaint, only
to disappear from the exposition shortly afterwards.  These mysterious
libraries have now vanished from the Second Amended Complaint
entirely.)</p><p>Since IBM's AIX is well known to contain large portions of Berkeley
code (towards which IBM has by all accounts met its license obligations),
SCO/Caldera's theory is at best extremely dubious.  In other words, to
prove its right to relief SCO/Caldera will need to show that whatever code
IBM gave to the open-source community was neither legally obtained by both
IBM and old SCO from a common source nor independently developed.</p><p>And, on top of all this, it now appears that SCO's claim to own the
Unix intellectual property was a deliberate and conscious lie on the part
of SCO's management.  On 28 May 2003 Novell stated<sup>[<a name="id306934" href="#ftn.id306934">41</a>]</sup>
that SCO owns neither the patents <span class="emphasis"><em>nor the copyrights</em></span>
to the Unix source code.  A patent search verifies at least the former
claim.</p><p>It is a matter of record that in 2002 SCO executives approached
Novell attempting to acquire the copyrights which SCO later claimed
to have been transferred in their previous asset purchase agreement. So,
SCO not only does not hold blocking Unix copyrights, its present 
management knew that to be the case before filing its complaint.</p><p>(2007 update: Judge Dale Kimball has ruled, in Novell's related suit
against SCO, that the Unix copyrights were not in fact transferred by the
asset purchase agreement.)</p><p>Finally, SCO's claim that it controls the right of all UNIX vendors
to use and distribute UNIX flies in the face of the many perpetual and
irrevocable licenses that AT&amp;T, Novell and SCO itself it has sold
to IBM, Sun, Hewlett-Packard and other Unix vendors.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id306965"></a>SCO/Caldera's claim to own Unix scalability techniques is weak</h3></div></div></div><p>We observed previously that substantial contributions from outside
sources to the historical Bell Labs codebase actually date back to before
System V Release 4 in 1985.  But even if we were to stipulate SCO/Caldera's
undiluted ownership of the entire Bell Labs code base, its claim to own the
class of enterprise scalability techniques at issue in its complaint would
be very weak.</p><p>A major reason that the historical Bell Labs code base became nomadic
among USL, Novell, and old SCO after 1990 is that it was already at that
time senescent relative to newer Unixes like Solaris, Irix, HP-UX, Ultrix,
and others.  The Vax and 3B series minicomputers for which the late
versions of the Bell Labs codebase were designed were years obsolete by
1995; the internal architecture of those variants of Unix is now primarily
of historical interest. We noted previously that SCO/Caldera and old SCO
made the &#8220;<span class="quote">ancient Unix</span>&#8221; Version 7 source code available for
free, which rather disposes of the theory that the original Unix code had
any residual IP value in the marketplace of today.  (SCO belatedly
terminated this offering on May 19th 2003, apparently realizing how badly
it damaged the trade-secret claims they were making at the time and
subsequently dropped.)</p><p>Furthermore, as previously noted, many Unix developers possess copies
of SVr1 through SVr4 versions of the historical Bell Labs source code,
including some code that was associated with it but under separate license.
We can therefore state that of the component technologies for enterprise
scaling, the Bell Labs codebase includes a journaling file system (in the
form of the VxFS Veritas journaling file system) and LVM (in the form of
VxVM). But SMP for Intel processors only entered the line in 1995 with
UnixWare 2.  PCI hot-swapping came in only in 1998 with Unixware 7.
Scaling to more than 4 processors did not arrive until 2005 with OpenServer
6.</p><p>Ironically, UnixWare did not get usable SMP on Intel until
<span class="emphasis"><em>after Linux</em></span>.  The UnixWare implementation was unstable
<sup>[<a name="id307005" href="#ftn.id307005">42</a>]</sup>
until mid-1997; Linux got working SMP in 1996 with the release of
2.0<sup>[<a name="id307017" href="#ftn.id307017">43</a>]</sup>.</p><p>As for 64-bit support, Linux had this in 1994, five years before IBM
became involved in Linux development. Neither of SCO's products has this
capability yet in 2006.</p><p>In fact, <span class="emphasis"><em>not one</em></span> of the key
enterprise-scalability technologies was present in the ancestral Unix code
before UnixWare got a JFS in 1992.  SCO's complaint alludes to this: in
paragraphs 46 to 50 they observe that it required three years of
development (1995-1998) to &#8216;harden&#8217; UnixWare for enterprise
use.  On SCO's own representation, the Bell Labs minicomputer-centered
codebase of 1989-1995 is hardly more relevant to today's enterprise
scalability challenges on today's PCs than the inner workings of a WWII-era
jeep would be to the design of this year's Formula One racing cars.</p><p>SCO/Caldera's claim to own the scalability techniques certainly
cannot be supported from the feature list of its own SCO OpenServer, a
genetic Unix.  Even the latest version<sup>[<a name="id307046" href="#ftn.id307046">44</a>]</sup>
has no LVM, no NUMA, and no hot-swapping.  That is, SCO/Caldera is alleging
that IBM misappropriated from SCO technologies which do not appear in SCO's
own product.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id307059"></a>SCO/Caldera ignores its own role in motivating the development

virtually none of these software developers and hobbyists had access to
enterprise-scale equipment and testing facilities for Linux

facilities such as the Open Source Development Lab<sup>[<a name="id307075" href="#ftn.id307075">45</a>]</sup>,
an organization funded by twenty-one companies including technology giants
such as Intel, Hewlett-Packard, Cisco Systems, NEC, Dell, and Hitachi
&#8212; <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> IBM.  OSDL has lab facilities in
Beaverton, Oregon, and Yokohama, Japan.  OSDL opened its first lab in
January 2001, four months before IBM's withdrawal from Project Monterey.
From October 2000 to October 2002, one of its sponsors was Caldera Systems
International!</p><p>OSDL is explicitly dedicated to assisting projects aiming
towards carrier-grade and data-center Linux.  It has supported over a
hundred projects, most directly concerned with Linux scalability,
performance improvements, fail-over and precisely those technical
areas in which SCO/Caldera alleges that Linux could have made no progress
without the intervention of IBM.</p><p>The existence of OSDL demonstrates industry-wide interest from
large hardware vendors in scalable Linux, sufficient to sustain
development with or without IBM's participation.  But there may be
a more direct linkage.</p><p>When OSDL spun up, IBM gained a choice: work with one small
partner that lacks demonstrated expertise or focus on the enterprise
market, or join a large consortium of industry heavyweights with
man-centuries of relevant experience.</p><p>That seems just about enough time for an astute IBM strategist to
conclude that old SCO was the less likely alternative to sustain a serious
Linux development and support effort over time.  To any technical person,
SCO's own failure to develop expertise beyond its small-business roots
seems a more plausible explanation for the switch to OSDL than some
nefarious anti-SCO conspiracy by top IBM executives.  To establish its
right to relief, SCO/Caldera would have to show that switching horses to
OSDL was not defensible as a normal business decision.</p><p>(2007 note: Earlier this year OSDL dissolved and re-formed as 
the Linux Foundation.)</p><p>But the earlier role of Caldera in hoisting itself on its own petard
was far more direct and less conjectural than this.</p><p>Symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) takes an operating system from
being able to manage a single processor to utilizing two.  The steps
from two to four, four to eight, and eight to sixteen are not trivial
but are far less challenging by comparison. Thus, SMP was perhaps the
single most significant barrier between the Linux of the early 1990s
and what SCO/Caldera itself characterizes as enterprise scaling.</p><p>Alan Cox (a key Linux developer generally considered Linus Torvalds's
chief lieutenant) led the early work on symmetric multiprocessing in
1995. A web page<sup>[<a name="id307138" href="#ftn.id307138">46</a>]</sup>,
confirmed by a 1995 public newsgroup posting from an employee of
Caldera<sup>[<a name="id307148" href="#ftn.id307148">47</a>]</sup>
establishes that the dual-processor motherboard on which he performed the
development was provided by none other than Caldera itself!</p><p>The timing is notable.  Caldera began contributing directly to
development of an enterprise-scalable Linux at around the same time old SCO
acquired the historical Bell Labs codebase in 1995, <span class="emphasis"><em>five

in 1999-2000.</p><p>Caldera acquired the SCO brand in 2001.  During the more than
eighteen months between the cancellation of Project Monterey and the
filing of the complaint, Caldera continued to garner revenues from the
SMP-enabled kernel it distributed in SCO Linux. </p><p>If Darl McBride and complainants did not know at the time of
the complaint that Caldera itself had played a lead role in the
very development they accuse IBM of having unfairly and unlawfully pursued, 
they are incompetent.  If they did know, their complaint appears to verge
closely upon perjury.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id307181"></a>SCO/Caldera misrepresents the state of Linux now</h3></div></div></div><p>In paragraph 85 of the original complaint, SCO/Caldera claimed:

quality for use by enterprise customers, it needed to be re-designed and
upgraded to accommodate complex multi-processor functionality that has
taken UNIX nearly 20 years to achieve.  This re-design is not
technologically feasible or even possible at the enterprise level without
(a) a high degree of design coordination, (b) access to expensive and
sophisticated design and testing equipment; (c) access to UNIX code and
development methods; (d) UNIX architectural experience; and (e) a very
significant financial investment. The contributions of IBM, which had
access to UNIX System V Protected Materials and years of enterprise level
experience, made possible this rapid redesign of Linux for enterprise
use.</span>&#8221;</p><p>Most of SCO/Caldera's complaint (as exemplified in paragraph 82)
turns on (a) representing pre-IBM Linux as a primitive makeshift being
slapped together by garage-band amateurs.  Their implied narrative is that
(b) only the corporate intervention of IBM made Linux a competitive
product, and that (c) IBM's intervention was in turn only efficacious due
to the ineffable superiority of the primal Bell Labs code base.</p><p>All three of these assertions are not merely false, they are
profoundly disrespectful to the many, many developers worldwide who
labored with sweat and brilliance to craft Linux into a world-class
operating system for eight years before IBM came on the scene.</p><p>These assertions depend on the presumption that the open-source
community consists of amateurs and incompetents, incapable of coordinating
to produce high-quality work.  In fact, the Linux developers have
consistently out-thought, out-imagined, and out-coded old SCO's and
SCO/Caldera's &#8212; which is precisely why old SCO went into the Linux
professional services business, why it added Linux application
compatibility to OpenServer, and why SCO/Caldera now finds itself without a
business model and reduced to suing the handiest pair of deep
pockets.</p><p>Let us take SCO/Caldera's pre-requisites in order:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>(1) a high degree of design coordination</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>Earlier, we noted that the success of Linux has motivated a sweeping
reappraisal of some of the central premises of software engineering.  It is
now generally accepted that a high degree of design coordination can be
achieved within the decentralized structure of open-source and Linux
development; this has been demonstrated repeatedly by open-source projects
such as the Apache webserver, the Perl and Python scripting languages, and
Linux itself.</p><p>SCO/Caldera's implication that this is impossible is false and
insulting.  It is also dishonest.  SCO/Caldera, and Caldera before it,
participated in Linux development for eight years before this
complaint and demonstrated understanding of the process through their
actions (such as supplying Alan Cox with SMP hardware).  They know
better.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>(2) access to expensive and sophisticated design

they learned from the first version of this response that access to Unix
&#8220;<span class="quote">methods and concepts</span>&#8221; is general in the community from which
Linux development springs, and that said access is through codebases not
subject to SCO's proprietary control or IP rights.  For more than thirty
years there has been a flourishing technical literature describing Unix
operating system architecture and concepts.  UNIX system internals and
architecture are routinely taught in university computer science courses.
Indeed, old SCO's and SCO/Caldera's own free publication of the Version 7
source code gave many programmers licit access to the ancestral Unix code,
methods, and concepts.</p><p>Their new claim is carefully crafted to imply that access to SCO's
code was a necessary condition.  Once again they ignore the existence of

its predecessors could assert proprietary rights.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>(4) UNIX architectural experience</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>The open-source community encompasses more man-centuries of Unix

author) are old Unix hands whose experience stretches back to Unix's
formative years in the 1970s and early 1980s.  We read SCO/Caldera's

until relatively recently, it is no longer so.  One of the
characteristics of open-source development is that it is an
<span class="emphasis"><em>inexpensive</em></span> process.  Not without costs; people
still need to be fed and salaried.  But PCs are cheap, and the
personnel load of open-source development is spread across a wider
range of organizations and user consortia than was the case when
process secrecy required a high degree of centralization and formal
management structure.</p><p>Part of the reason SCO/Caldera is in distress is that the functional
role it filled as a nexus of capital and management skills is near to being
obsolete.  Software development is simply outgrowing the need for such
organizations.  SCO/Caldera is on the wrong side of history.</p></dd></dl></div><p>In paragraph 97, SCO/Caldera continues: <span class="emphasis"><em>&#8220;<span class="quote">The only way

of the proprietary and confidential UNIX Software Code and libraries.

scientists at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, plaintiff's predecessor in

is.  By wrapping itself in the mantle of Bell Labs, SCO/Caldera hopes to
obscure the fact that its own non-Linux products do not in fact exhibit the
enterprise-ready quality it accuses IBM of stealing, and never have.
SCO/Caldera further attempts to confuse present-day claims arising from the

categories of rights in paragraph 68 of the original complaint,
SCO/Caldera's complaints have implied the existence of relevant
intellectual-property rights based on patent, copyright, trade-secret, and
trademark law as a background to the explicit matter of its licensing
dispute with IBM over Linux.</p><p>It is notable that the complaints have done so without ever actually
stating what those claims are.  We have previously observed that the
outcome of the USL/Novell-vs.-BSD lawsuit places the very existence 
of such rights in serious doubt.  But there are other reasons for
SCO/Caldera's coyness which should not escape notice.</p><p>One is that, despite misleading claims implied on SCO/Caldera's web
pages by phrases like &#8220;<span class="quote">exclusive licensing</span>&#8221;, SCO/Caldera does not
own or control the Unix trademark.  As we have previously observed,
that trademark &#8212; and the privilege of suing IBM for relief on a
trademark-violation theory &#8212; belongs to The Open Group.</p><p>Furthermore, SCO/Caldera is barred by the terms of the GNU General
Public License from making copyright or patent-infringement claims on
any technology shipped in conjunction with the Linux kernel that
SCO/Caldera itself has been selling for the last eight years.
Therefore, SCO/Caldera may accuse IBM of misappropriating SCO-owned software
to improve the Linux kernel only if that software does not actually
ship with the Linux kernel it is alleged to be improving!</p><p>Finally, SCO/Caldera is barred from making trade-secret claims on the
contents of the Linux kernel, not merely by the fact that the kernel
source is generally available, but by the fact that SCO/Caldera has made
the sources of its Linux kernel available for download from SCO's own
website! <sup>[<a name="id307675" href="#ftn.id307675">56</a>]</sup>.</p><p>SCO/Caldera, as a matter of fact and law, clearly does retain
proprietary rights with respect to the SCO OpenServer binary
distribution (which has never been published in source-code form and
is not under the GPL).  It is not the purpose of this position paper to dispute
those rights.  But to the extent that SCO/Caldera uses those proprietary
rights to attempt to cast a shadow over Linux, it maintains a position
which is factually untenable and dishonest.</p><p>Indeed, the effect of SCO/Caldera's complaint is to systematically
mislead and obfuscate on the issue of what background rights SCO/Caldera
actually has at issue in its claim of tort and license violations.
The clear intent is to deceive observers into believing that SCO/Caldera has a
licit claim.</p><p>But that emperor has no clothes. Ultimately, SCO/Caldera's argument
would appear to boil down to asserting that &#8220;<span class="quote">IBM had no right to
give the community technologies that SCO/Caldera had made freely available on

intensity and nature difficult for strangers to the issue to
understand. The drama here is not merely about money or the competing
agendas of corporations, but about the Unix community's sense of
ownership of its own work.  That community, and that sense of 
ownership, is exceptionally powerful for reasons which bear
materially on the matter of SCO/Caldera's complaint.</p><p>Unix was born in 1969 at Bell Laboratories among computer
science researchers.  After 1975, much of its development was actually
done by contributors outside Bell Labs, especially at UC Berkeley and
elsewhere in academia.  However, AT&amp;T continued to formally own
the results of that collective work.  Indeed, they spent five years
after 1983 in a largely fruitless quest to commercialize it as a
product &#8212; a role which was played much more effectively by Sun
Microsystems and other licensees, including old SCO and IBM.</p><p>Even during the early days of Unix commercialization, the Unix
code base was widely regarded as a commons worked by many hands.  As
time went on and Unix evolved, possession of an AT&amp;T source
license came to be seen as more a pro-forma gesture in the direction
of history than a concession that AT&amp;T's intellectual property
still contributed a dominating part of the value.  This was especially
so after the Berkeley hackers added Internet capability to Unix 
around 1980.</p><p>Thus, the community of Unix hackers that had grown up around the
pre-commercial releases never lost the conviction that, ethically, the Unix
code belonged to <span class="emphasis"><em>them</em></span> &#8212; the people who had the
ideas and wrote the code &#8212; regardless of what the legal paperwork
said.  The outcome of the USL-vs.-Berkeley lawsuit in 1993, which severed
the claims of AT&amp;T and its successor Novell to the BSD source code, was
universally regarded in the community as no more than simple and overdue
justice.</p><p>From 1975 to about 1995, therefore, the Unix vendors and the Unix
hackers existed in a kind of half-symbiotic, half-antagonistic embrace.
The Unix hackers (who needed the jobs vendors were providing to practice
their craft) expressed their conviction of ownership by freely passing
around bootlegged Unix sources among themselves for study and
problem-solving.  Vendors (who needed the hackers to fill job slots) looked
the other way, routinely winking at behavior that was technically a massive
theft of critical intellectual property as long as it stayed in the family
and nobody's bottom line got hurt.  But given this history, any attempt to
make trade-secret claims based on the historical Bell Labs source code
would be at best highly disingenuous (and in fact SCO, after making these
claims in the original Complaint, dropped them from its amended
Complaints).</p><p>This tacit truce began to disintegrate after 1990.  The rise of
the PC meant that the hackers had less need of massive corporate
infrastructure and capital concentrations to support their art.  The
USL-vs.-Berkeley lawsuit was the first major confrontation that the
hackers won.  Under the settlement terms, the Berkeley source code
&#8212; and the Unix tradition with it &#8212; achieved the autonomy
in law that it had always deserved in the minds of Unix programmers.</p><p>Two related developments were going on at the same time between
1990 and 1995.  One was the rise of open-source development, and the
other was the senescence of the historical Bell Labs codebase.  While
corporate Unix vendors continued to pay formal obeisance to the Bell
Labs codebase by buying Unix source code licenses from AT&amp;T's
successors in interest, the rise of Linux and the open-source BSDs
made the disposition of the ancestral Unix sources increasingly seem a
meaningless game played among lawyers, of little remaining interest to
Unix hackers.  The technical leading edge of the Unix tradition had
moved elsewhere, notably to Linux. Nobody, neither the vendors nor the
hackers, really needed the Bell Labs source code any more.</p><p>Indeed, when the old-school Unix hackers who at that time ran old SCO
purchased the ancestral Bell Labs code in 1995, it was widely viewed as
little more than a bit of clever marketing, or even as a pure nostalgia
trip by techies who had bought the ancestral source code just because they
could.  At that time (as we have noted in <a href="#sco_open" title="SCO's history with open source">the section called &#8220;SCO's history with open source&#8221;</a>') old
SCO gave every evidence of understanding and endorsing Linux.</p><p>But SCO/Caldera is no longer run by Unix old hands.  Their complaint,
once again, has thrust the question of &#8220;<span class="quote">who owns Unix</span>&#8221; into
the foreground of debate.  This time around, the hacker community has
corporate allies (IBM among them) who understand the new world of open
source &#8212; and that it is to their own business advantage to respect
the Unix hackers as the owners of their art.</p><p>SCO/Caldera's complaint, in all its brazen mendacity, is the last gasp
of proprietary Unix.  We in the open-source community (and our allies) are
more than competent to carry forward the Unix tradition we founded
so many years ago.  We pray that all assertions of exclusive corporate
ownership over this tradition be given a swift and definitive
end.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id307827"></a>Policy implications and recommendations</h2></div></div></div><p>A judgment in favor of SCO/Caldera could do serious damage to the
open-source community.  SCO/Caldera's implication of wider claims could
turn Linux into an intellectual-property minefield, with potential users
and allies perpetually wary of being mugged by previously unasserted IP
claims, and ever-more-outlandish theories of entitlement being propounded
by parties with only the most tenuous relationship to anyone who ever wrote
actual program code.</p><p>On behalf of the community that wrote most of today's Unix code, and
whose claims to have done so were tacitly recognized by the impairment of
AT&amp;T's rights under the 1993 settlement, we protest that to allow this
outcome would be a very grave injustice.  We wrote our Unix and Linux code
as a gift and an expression of art, to be enjoyed by our peers and used by
others for all licit purposes both non-profit and for-profit.  We did
<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> write it to have it appropriated by men so
dishonorable that after making profit from our gift for eight years they
could turn around and insult our competence.</p><p>Damage to the open-source community would matter, because we are
both today's principal source of innovation in software and the
guardians and maintainers of the open Internet.  Our autonomy is
everyone's bulwark against government and corporate control of the
digital media that are increasingly central in political, commercial,
and personal communications.  Our creative energy is what perpetually
renews and finds ever more exciting uses for computers and networks.
The vigor of our culture today will translate into more possibilities
for everyone tomorrow.</p><p>On behalf of Unix developers over the last thirty-five years, of
today's Linux and open-source developers, and of all Internet users
everywhere, we therefore express these hopes with respect to court
findings:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>To find against SCO/Caldera in its complaint against IBM, or for IBM on
any motion for dismissal or summary judgment.</p></li><li><p>To ground the finding in terms which will foreclose any future claims
by SCO/Caldera of proprietary control over technologies contributed to
Linux.</p></li><li><p>To confirm that SCO/Caldera cannot re-litigate the USL/Novell-vs.-BSD
action by stealth, and thus that SCO/Caldera's ownership of the ancestral
Bell Labs source code gives it no authority or proprietary entitlement
over the works of the open-source community and Unix developers at
large.</p></li><li><p>That AT&amp;T's successors in interest, having inherited the benefits
that flowed from misappropriating BSD code into System V, are estopped from
claiming proprietary rights in System V and derivatives.</p></li></ul></div><p>We further suggest that SCO/Caldera's complaint is knowingly deceptive
to a degree that recommends sanctions under the Utah and Federal Rule 11
of Civil Procedure.</p><p>We feel the facts of Unix history are sufficiently compelling and
particular that the court would be justified in ruling as we recommend
above without attempting to challenge and re-construct any of the legal
theory of software intellectual property.</p><p><a name="ip_theory"></a>Since the dispute has moved to Federal court, it is
now within the court's purview to rule on more general issues of
intellectual-property law as they pertain to this case.  OSI pleads to the
court to find as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>To find that claims of trade secrecy in software are incompatible
with a routine business practice of selling the source code licenses to
that software to educational institutions or for use as training
materials. (Techniques commonly taught in classrooms cannot be considered
secrets.)</p></li><li><p>That any software vendor, having partipated in an open-source commons
and benefitted from the products thereof, is estopped from claiming
proprietary rights that would prevent other participants from symmetrically
collecting that same benefit.  (If you drank from the well, you don't get
to poison it.) </p></li><li><p>That the implication of the 1993 settlement is good; in cases of
non-willful code contamination, removal of the infringing code is 
a sufficient remedy. (You cannot poison an entire project by getting 
a snippet of infringing code unknowingly accepted.)</p></li><li><p>That the GNU General Public License under which Linux is issued is
in fact a valid license and does create binding legal obligations on those
who accept its terms.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="bibliography"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="id307963"></a>Bibliography</h2></div></div></div><div class="biblioentry"><a name="TNHD"></a><p>[TNHD] <span class="title"><i>The New Hacker's Dictionary</i>. </span><span class="edition">Third Edition. </span><span class="editor"><span class="firstname">Eric S.</span> <span class="surname">Raymond</span>. </span><span class="copyright">Copyright © 1996. </span><span class="isbn">ISBN 0-262-68092-0. </span><span class="publisher"><span class="publishername">MIT Press. </span></span><span class="pagenums">547pp.. </span><span class="releaseinfo">HTML at the <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr//jargon/" target="_top">Jargon File Resource Page</a>.
