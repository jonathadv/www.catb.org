This is the README file for the reference implementation of IEEE
PILOT by Eric S. Raymond <esr@thyrsus.com>.

The following sample PILOT programs are included:

tutor.p		--- interactive tutorial on PILOT
story.p		--- program to generate a silly story from user input
tea.p		--- teaches the art of tea-brewing
speaknum.p	--- translate numbers to English
goldilocks.p	--- another silly-story program, more interactive

It will be helpful to have handy a copy of the IEEE Standard for
Programmed Inquiry, Learning, Or Teaching (PILOT).  This is IEEE Std
1154-1991, ISBN 1-55937-151-X.  Be sure you also get the two loose
pages of corrections.

The distribution includes an interactive tutorial program written in
PILOT that will help you learn PILOT.  It is tutor.p; to run it, make
pilot and run `pilot tutor'.

For help on porting this PILOT implementation to other environments, see
"A Brief Tour of the PILOT Internals", included with this distribution.

			AUTHOR'S DISCLAIMER

Don't blame me for the language design; I think it's wretched, too,
and I only did this implementation for the hack value.  Finally, a
*real* language that's as perverse and limiting as INTERCAL...

The project logo is an image of a small part from a Lionel train
set, colloquially known as a 'cowcatcher' but formally a 'pilot'.

No warranty express or implied, etc, etc.  It runs and compiles the
conforming examples the IEEE 1154 working group sent me and the
tutorial I wrote for it.  That's all.

			TO DO

I can't see anyone but the ex-perpetrator of C-INTERCAL being willing to
spend good hacking time on this turkey.  Nevertheless, there's a TODO
file for anyone afflicted with fits of temporary lunacy as
severe as mine.  You might find an update from my WWW home page,
http://www.catb.org/~esr.

Have fun with this, or something...
