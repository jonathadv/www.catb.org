		letterize -- phone digits to letter-mnemonics
	by Eric S. Raymond <esr@snark.thyrsus.com> Oct 24 1994

I built this around some code for detecting pronounceable letter combinations
that I picked up off the net.  Not sure who wrote it.

Files:

	README		-- this file
	letterize.c	-- the code
	Makefile	-- A simple Makefile
	letterize.1	-- man page
	letterize.adoc	-- XML DocBook master for the man page

Bugs.  Don't talk to me about bugs.  Email me at esr@thyrsus.com instead.
