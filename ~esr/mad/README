			README for MAD

This program is a work of reconstructive archeology, a compiler for
the Michigan Algorithmic Decoder (MAD) language from 1959-1962.  It
first translates MAD code into C, then uses the local C compiler to
make an executable binary.  It includes both a complete transcription of
the original MAD manual and 100dpi scans of the original.

Added many enhancements and CTSS support.

You will need David Beazley's PLY code to handle parsing.

Don't try running this on a 32-bit machine, the generated C code
assumes longs have 64 bits.

This implementation is part of the Retrocomputing Museum.  For related 
resources, see <http://www.catb.org/~esr/retro/>.
