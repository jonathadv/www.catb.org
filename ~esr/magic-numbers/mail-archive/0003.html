<p>
The reason I'm asking is because somebody on the W3C HTML development list<br>
suggested that it might be a good idea if there were a public Internet <br>
registry of magic numbers, given as-official-as-it-get status by an RFC which<br>
software developers could quote.<br>
<p>
This stimulated some thoughts in my head:<br>
<p>
(1) This sounds like a worthy service project.<br>
<p>
(2) I would be willing to do it.  After a couple years of maintaining <br>
    terminfo/termcap, I'm pretty comfortable with both the technicalia <br>
    and politics involved in efforts like this.<br>
<p>
(3) It might also be useful for there to be a File Extensions Registry,<br>
    and for file(1) to start trying to deduce stuff from file extensions<br>
    when the magic number deductions are ambiguous or nonexistent.<br>
<p>
(4) It would be an interesting design challenge to extend the magic-file<br>
    language to declare hints or deductions from filename patterns.<br>
<p>
As an example of the kind of thing I mean, I can imagine a future version<br>
of file(1) which, upon seeing a file named `foo.l' would declare it<br>
a "Lisp source code file" if the initial segment of the file matched<br>
the regexp [ \t\n]*;* or [ \t\n]*(, but a "Lex source file" if the initial<br>
segment matched [ \t\n]*/\* or [ \t\n]*%%.<br>
<p>
Are these thoughts interesting to you two?<br>
