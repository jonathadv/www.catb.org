Thanks, Eric, for the summary.  Only a couple comments/questions:<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;The reason I'm asking is because somebody on the W3C HTML development list</i><br>
<i>&gt;suggested that it might be a good idea if there were a public Internet </i><br>
<i>&gt;registry of magic numbers, given as-official-as-it-get status by an RFC which</i><br>
<i>&gt;software developers could quote.</i><br>
<p>
I assume we're talking about an informational RFC, not a standards-track<br>
one, right?  Does the W3C want to make something like this a Recommendation,<br>
too?  (I assume not, but since the PNG spec just became the first one and<br>
has been approved as an RFC as well, I thought I'd ask...)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;I'd like to help (coauthor) any RFC.  I really want to see this done</i><br>
<i>&gt;right.  I also happen to have some experience with standards.</i><br>
<p>
I've also been peripherally involved with the PNG and deflate/zlib/gzip<br>
standards, but I don't claim any particular experience on that basis, nor<br>
time to do anything substantial, so you two are more than welcome to do<br>
the hard work... :-)<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;We might also want to bring in Greg Roelofs &lt;newt@uchicago.edu&gt;.  He</i><br>
<i>&gt;designed the magic for PNG and might have a few good ideas.</i><br>
<p>
"newt@pobox.com" is the preferred address these days.  I expect that it<br>
will be permanent.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt;Yes, I know the acronym is weak.  Suggestions for improvement welcomed.</i><br>
<p>
	"magically approximate group of identification codes"?<br>
<p>
or maybe<br>
<p>
	"magically associated group of identification codes"<br>
	"magically approximate group of Internet codes"<br>
	"magically associated group of Internet codes"<br>
	"magic atoms of gory identification codes"<br>
	"massive amounts of gooey Internet crap"<br>
<p>
	"mostly ..."<br>
	"mainly ..."<br>
	"maybe ..."<br>
	"magnificently ..."<br>
	"malignantly ..."<br>
	"monstrously ..."<br>
	"morbidly ..."<br>
	etc.<br>
