<i>&gt;I would like to collect any comments and relay them to the POSIX</i><br>
<i>&gt;standards group.  Since we can't expect another revision of POSIX.2</i><br>
<i>&gt;for a while, we should really push POSIX to get it right this time.</i><br>
<p>
My comments are pretty much restricted to the magic file, so this message<br>
goes back out to both lists.  Aside from the older comments Dan collected<br>
and posted yesterday, the only missing item I noticed was a comment on the<br>
identification of "byte" with "signed character"; this seems counter-<br>
intuitive to me (i.e., it should be unsigned).  Not a big deal, though.<br>
<p>
In terms of updating Dan's old comments, it might also be useful to offer<br>
a shorthand version of the endian prefixes (they should probably be suffixes<br>
now):<br>
<p>
	dS -&gt; dSb<br>
	dL -&gt; dLb<br>
	d4 -&gt; d4l<br>
	etc.<br>
<p>
Also note the part about an optional integer to indicate the length of the<br>
type; this renders Dan's old comment about non-portability at least partially<br>
moot (although it will require retrofitting such support both to Darwin file<br>
and to its magic data, and it would be *nice* if the older types could be<br>
identified with a fixed size to avoid breaking portability with most older<br>
implementations--that won't help Crays or Alphas, though).  The new POSIX<br>
draft doesn't specify whether the integer suffix can be used with the other<br>
suffixes (e.g., C, S, I, L are redundant, and note the possibilities/compli-<br>
cations for dealing with wide characters; also, how does the integer value<br>
affect the interpretation of the floating-point suffixes?).  That should be<br>
clarified.  (Did it say anything about floating-point numbers being in IEEE<br>
format?  I didn't notice.)<br>
<p>
That's all that came to mind offhand.  The endianness issue is the critical<br>
one, of course.<br>
