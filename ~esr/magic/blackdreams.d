Black Dreams

1 Sengir Vampire
1 Junun Efreet
2 Bog Imp
4 Plague Rats
4 Frozen Shades         (remember, you can add +N/+N at interrupt speed)
4 Scathe Zombies
4 Drudge Skeletons      (utility blockers, as usual)

4 Terror
4 Fear
4 Drain Life
2 Raise Dead            (save these for heavies like the Sengir Vampire)
2 Sinkhole              (plug in some Dark Rituals if you don't have these)
4 Unholy Strength

20 Swamp

1 Soul Net
1 Throne of Bone
1 Fountain of Youth
1 Maze of Ith
1 Nightmare
1 Mind Twist

A nasty, *nasty* black deck -- especially with the specials, which shore up
your defences a lot and add one serious heavy (the Nightmare).

Bends Alodar's Axioms a bit in that the airforce isn't a four-pack of one
creature.  Selah.  The point is that your odds of being able to cast one of
these early on is good.  Having two Vampires and two Imps might be nicer than
the Efreet, which is easy to cast early but expensive to maintain.

The combination of Throne of Bone, Soul Net, and Fountain Of Youth is very
potent -- means you can expect to max out your mana use every turn and gain
lives from any that isn't spent pushing spells (but save some as cover for
any Drudge Skeletons on the table).
