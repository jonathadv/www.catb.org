Bruises From Above

4 Prodigal Sorcerers
2 Phantom Monsters

4 Unsummons
4 Spell Blast
1 Sunken City
1 Energy Tap

10 Islands

2 Vampire Bats
2 Bog Imps
4 Drudge Skeletons      (make these Walls of Bone if you can)
1 Sengir Vampire
1 Nightmare             (or this can be another Sengir Vampire)

4 Drain Life
4 Terror
2 Curse Artifact

10 Swamps

60 cards.  Specials I like to add:

1 Time Elemental

1 Maze of Ith
1 Black Vise

This deck is almost all fliers; the only exceptions are the Prodigal Sorcerors
and the regenerating blockers (Drudge Skeletons, Wall of Bone) that you bring
out early to stop groundpounders.

Very fast weenie decks can sometimes swarm this one before it has time to
develop.  Barring that, it's tough to beat.  Just keep attacking; your flyers
will usually hurt your opponent faster than he/she can hurt you.  Try to save
the Drain Lifes until late when both duelists' point scores are low.
