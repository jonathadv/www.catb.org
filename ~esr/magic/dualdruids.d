Dual Druids

4 Scryb Sprites
4 Thallids
2 Savaen Elves          (use these to undo Phantasmal Land, etc.)
2 Thelonite Druids      (the trees shall come to Dunsinane)
4 War Mammoths
2 Carnivorous Plants
2 Craw Worms

4 Wild Growths
4 Giant Growths
2 Regeneration          (good to put on your Scryb Sprites)
2 Tranquility
2 Stream of Life
2 Lure
4 Venoms
2 Aspect of Wolf        (cast your Aspect of Wolf cards on these)

20 Forest

This is 60 cards and tournament-legal straight up.  The specials:

1 Instill Energy
1 Gaea's Touch
2 Gaea's Liege
2 Wooden Spheres

This deck, despite having no capacity for direct damage, is pretty
nasty.  The Scryb Sprites and Thallids give you an early offense, and
a Giant-Growthed Scryb Sprite will kill off most fliers.  The War
Mammoths are good for their trample damage.  If the game lasts long
enough for the Craw Worms to come out your opponent will probably find
them as heavy as anything he/she can field.

But the real kicker is the Druids.  You've got a 30% chance one will
come out by turn 5, in which case you can swarm your opponent with 
2/3 forests (you're likely to have 3 or 4 in play at that point).

Your defensive strategy is simple.  Use the walls to stop what you can,
let your points draw down, then dishearten your opponent with a late
Stream Of Life.  Playing with the Wooden Spheres will help a lot.

Also, note that if Gaea's Touch comes out early you'll have extra
lands to animate.  The Instill Energy probably wants to go on your
Craw Worms or an Aspect-of-Wolfed War Mammoth.
