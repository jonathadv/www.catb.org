1 Gaea's Liege
1 Feral Thallid
1 Air Elemental

This is kind of a leftovers deck.  The Green creatures give it a nice front
line, though.  As for those jumps, throw some bouncing grizzlies at your
next opponent.

Phantasmal Terrain plus Gaea's Liege plus the Psychic Venoms gives it
are fair land-denial capability.  Play them early and often.
