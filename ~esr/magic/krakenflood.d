This is a more gimmicky and specialized deck than I usually like to play; it's
tuned for taking out mages of the Blue.  If your opponent is not using blue
mana, your heaviest creatures are out of it until you can play Phantasmal Land
and make it stick.

Note the land-denial potential of Phantasmal Land and Psychic Venom; these
compensate for a deck that is defensively weak.  Don't hold on
to the Venoms, play them early to hamper your opponent while you collect
islands.

All these spells except the Phantasmal Lands and Sea Serpents require only
one mana each.  This is why the deck is so light on Plains mana, and could
be lighter in islands if we didn't want to make sure of usually getting a lot
of them early.
