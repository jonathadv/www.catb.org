I named this deck `Death By Roquefort' because it's blue and green and
fungus-flavored.  It's nasty -- it routinely clobbers Them Bones, for
example.  If you get two or more Thallids out, hold them back and have
them generate Saprolings to weenie your opponent to death.

It's got a more lopsided color distribution than I usually use; that's because
green creatures are cheap for their throw weight.  One change you might
consider is going to 12 Forest/8 Island.
