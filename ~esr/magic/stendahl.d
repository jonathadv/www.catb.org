Stendahl's Mighty Hand

2 Earth Elemental       (good target for those Unholy Strengths)
4 Hurloon Minotaur      (these are your lime infantry)
2 Dwarven Warriors

2 Shatter               (mess up those artifact collectors)
2 Earthbind             (must have something to stop flyers)
4 Lightning Bolt        (this helps with the flyers too)

10 Mountain

2 Dark Ritual
2 Sinkhole              (this has been discontinued)
2 Raise Dead
2 Howl From Beyond
2 Paralyze
4 Unholy Strength       (cast these on your Hurloon Minotaurs)
2 Drain Life

4 Drudge Skeletons      (use for blocking big guys, then regenerate them)
4 Scathe Zombies

10 Swamp

This is 60 cards and tournament-legal as-is.  Optional extras:

1 Wall of Fire
1 Battering Ram
1 Maze of Ith

This is a classic red & black go-for-the-quick-kill design.

As usual, it counts on your regenerating creatures as blockers.  It
also relies on Unholy Strength to boost your heavies to
nigh-unstoppables, or your mediums to heavies.

It's defensively weak, hence the recommendation for Maze of Ith.

If you can't get Sinkholes, make them Stone Rains.
