<p>You can help stop the SCO attack on IBM and the Linux community.
I'm looking for ways that Unix trade secrets may have been legally
nullified.</p>

<p>OSI has <a href="/~esr/hackerlore/sco-vs-ibm.html">explained</a> why
this suit is groundless.  Now I want to know if you have ever had read
access to proprietary Unix source code (not just binaries and
documentation) under circumstances where either no non-disclosure
agreement was required or whatever non-disclosure agreement you had
was not enforced.</p>

<p>All proprietary Unix and Unix-like operating systems are
relevant.  I am especially interested in AT&amp;T,
USL/Novell/UnixWare and XENIX/SCO versions, but all proprietary
versions are interesting.  This includes but is not limited to AIX,
SunOS/Solaris, and HP-UX.  It includes not just living Unix dialects but
dead ones as well.</p>

<p>Do <em>not</em> tell me about access to Linux sources or those for
the open-source BSD variants.  Access to "ancient Unix" (Version 7,
Version 6, and older; yes, I know all about the Lions book, so don't
tell me about it) is also not interesting; we can prove those were
generally available.</p>

<p>I can't talk about how this information will be applied, nor by who.
You'll have to trust me, or at any rate my record as an ambassador of
the community, that it <em>will</em> be effective and that I
<em>will</em> respect your confidentiality and not disclose any
facts about individuals without their express permission.</p>

<p>You can read about <a href="legal.html">Trade Secret Law and Risk</a>
and <a href="howto.html">How To Report Access</a>.</p>

<p>SCO wants to use the courts to attack us and claim control of the
Linux code; let's make them rue the day they thought this was a good
idea, by proving that they have no trade secrets.</p>

<p>There is also a <a
href='http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=65718&cid=6057100'>Eminem-style
rap song</a> about this case and a rather good parody of the poisoning
scene in <a
href='http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=75144&cid=6729327'>The
Princess Bride</a>.</p>
