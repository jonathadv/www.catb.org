<p>Trade-secret protection is fragile.  It's designed that way. To
maintain trade secrecy, the holder of the trade secret has to make
a certain minimum effort to prevent it from being disclosed. There
is good reason to suspect that SCO and other proprietary Unix 
vendors have not met this obligation, and can no longer claim
trade-secrecy status in the Unix code.</p>

<p>The one time a judge has looked at this question, during the
AT&amp;T-vs-Berkeley lawsuit in 1993-94, he denied AT&amp;T an
injunction, noting that he thought it likely that AT&amp;T had
forfeited trade secrecy simply by selling source licenses in the
way they had been doing.</p>

<p>For the SCO-vs.-IBM lawsuit, controlling law is that of the State
of Utah.  Under Utah law, a party wishing to show that information has
trade-secrecy status must show that: it is (1) not generally known;
(2) not readily ascertainable by proper means; and (3) the subject of
efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its
secrecy.</p>

<p>"Readily ascertainable by proper means" is probably the easiest one
to break.  We can probably get a court to find that "readily ascertainable"
includes information disclosed through source code releases made available
to educational institutions.</p>

<h2>How to break trade secrecy</h2>

<p>The following are all scenarios that could compromise trade-secrecy
protection on Unix source code:</p>

<ul>
<li>As a student, teacher, or professor, you had access to Unix source
code.  Your school did not require you to enter a non-disclosure
agreement.</li>

<li>Your employer provided you with access to Unix source code and did
not require, or failed to enforce, confidentiality &mdash; or failed 
to require that you erase your copy when you left employment.  </li>

<li>A representative, employee, or agent of a Unix vendor provided you
with access to Unix source code and failed to require that you enter a
non-disclosure agreement.</li>

<li>As a working programmer, you received Unix source code from
other working programmers who were not to your knowledge bound
by non-disclosure agreements.</li>
</ul>

<p>Enough evidence of these kinds with respect to any given Unix version
would nullify the trade-secret status of the code.</p>

<p>If you still have copies of proprietary Unix source code, or can
provide me with a live download pointer to same, that is especially
interesting.</p>

<h2>Legal risks</h2>

<p>You take no risk by  telling me you have had read access to Unix
source code.</p>

<p>You should not be at risk in giving me download pointers to source
unless you are yourself bound by an employment contract or
nondisclosure agreement with respect to the source &mdash; under
trade-secret law, it only takes one uncontrolled link in the chain for
you to be in the clear.</p>

<p>Giving me an actual copy of source code, on the other hand, would
need to be handled carefully to avoid copyright violation.</p>

<p>Please note that I have no intention of violating anyone's
intellectual-property rights &mdash; rather, I am seeking instances in
which some of those rights have been actually forfeited under
controlling law.</p>
