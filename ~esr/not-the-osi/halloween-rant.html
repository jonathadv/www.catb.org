<p>You followed a link that said ``anti-Microsoft jeremiad''. If
you're expecting anything else, back out now &mdash; because this is
where I vent my spleen (unofficially; my fellow boardmembers at the
Open Source Initiative made me move this off the OSI site) at these
memoranda and everything they represent about the Borg of
Redmond.</p>

<p>I've been watching Microsoft run its game for nearly twenty
years and the Halloween memoranda were the last straw. I'm mad as
hell, and I'm not going to take it any more...</p>

<p>These memoranda lay naked the assumptions of Microsoft's
corporate culture &mdash; the insularity, the arrogance, the obsessive
drive to control both markets and customers, the casual acceptance
of FUD tactics, and the perversion of what should be open standards
into devices for monopoly lock-in.</p>

<p>More specifically, they reveal exactly how seriously Microsoft
takes the threat from Linux and other open-source projects. And
they reveal in detail the dirty tricks Microsoft is willing to use
to stop them.</p>

<p>But anybody who finds them a surprise ought to wake up and smell
the coffee (or maybe the Microsoft Java). These documents are
certainly not the first time Microsoft has planned tactics that are
underhanded, anti-competitive, and abusive of its customers. Sleazy
behavior, covered by utterly brilliant marketing, has been a
pattern in Microsoft's business practices since they were a garage
outfit running on subsidies from Bill Gates's wealthy parents.</p>

<p>Bill Gates has pissed me off from day one. I don't mind that he
got rich, but I do mind that he peddles himself as the ultimate
hacker and God's own gift to technology when his track record
suggests that he wouldn't know a decent design idea or a
well-written hunk of code if it bit him in the face. He's made his
billions selling elaborately sugar-coated crap that runs like a pig
on Quaaludes, crashes at the drop of an electron, and has set the
computing world back by at least a decade.</p>

<p>Bill Gates pretends to defend ``innovation'', and if he did I'd
love him for it. But there's very little evidence that Microsoft
even knows what the word means. Buying or outright stealing key
technologies rather than innovating has been a Microsoft trait from
the beginning. Consider this list...</p>

<p>MS-DOS: bought (from Tim Paterson). PC1 BIOS code: stolen
(almost bit-for-bit from Gary Kildall's CP/M BIOS). The Windows
interface: copied (incompetently, from Apple). On-the-fly disk
compression: stolen (from Stac Electronics). Internet Explorer:
bought or stolen, depending on who you believe (from Spyglass). And
the list only <em>starts</em> with these.</p>

<p>And the worst &mdash; the absolute <em>worst</em> &mdash; is that he's
conditioned computer users to expect and even <em>love</em>
derivative, shoddily-implemented crap. Millions of people think
that it's right, it's <em>normal</em> to have an operating system
so fragile that it hangs crashes three or four times a week and has
to be rebooted every time you change anything deeper than the
wallpaper. Dammit, we knew how to do better than that in 1975!</p>

<p>If you're not an engineer, maybe you can't understand how deeply
offensive most techies find this kind of thing. It gives me actual
pain to see what Microsoft has done to the computing world, to the
expectations of users, to the craft of programming that I love. But
most of all, it disgusts me to the point of rage and nausea to
contemplate living in the Microsoft-only future Gates has planned
for everybody.</p>

<p>Linus Torvalds jokes about world domination, but Bill Gates
<em>means</em> it. What Microsoft has done in the past is very bad,
but I would not have gone to war with them over the past. The real
issue is that they won't leave me and my friends any safe place.
They want to hijack the Internet we built with brains and sweat and
blood; they want top-to-bottom control of computing everywhere;
they're determined to have it <em>all</em>, forever and ever,
amen.</p>

<p>That is the deepest subtext of the Halloween memoranda. And
that, ultimately, is why I must be Bill Gates's enemy.</p>
