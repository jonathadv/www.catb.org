<h2 class="centered">Goodbye, "free software"; hello, "open source"</h2>

<p class='annotation'>
This is the original call to the community to start using the term
&lsquo;open source&lsquo; that I issued on 8 February 1998.  The event
referred to in the first paragraph is the 23 January announcement of
the Mozilla source code release.  Because this is a historic document,
I have fixed some link drift but haven't re-styled it to match the
rest of my site. Though it has been converted to XHTML rather than
HTML classic, except for this gray box and the RCS date at the bottom
it looks pretty much exactly as it did then.  There are <a
href='http://wiki.kickbill.com/wiki/doku.php?id=goodbye_free_software_hello_open_source'>Spanish</a>
and <a
href="http://lab.akakom.org/~aptx49/linux/open-source.html">Indonesian</a>
translations of this document.
</p>

<p>After the <a
href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030901000000*/http://www.holgermetzger.de/netscape/press1.html">Netscape
announcement</a> broke in January I did a lot of thinking about the
next phase -- the serious push to get "free software" accepted in the
mainstream corporate world. And I realized we have a serious problem
with "free software" itself.</p>

<p>Specifically, we have a problem with the <em>term</em> "free
software", itself, not the concept. I've become convinced that the
term has to go.</p>

<p>The problem with it is twofold. First, it's confusing; the term
"free" is very ambiguous (something the <a
href="http://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a>'s
propaganda has to wrestle with constantly). Does "free" mean "no
money charged?" or does it mean "free to be modified by anyone", or
something else?</p>

<p>Second, the term makes a lot of corporate types nervous. While
this does not intrinsically bother me in the least, we now have a
pragmatic interest in converting these people rather than thumbing
our noses at them. There's now a chance we can make serious gains
in the mainstream business world without compromising our ideals
and commitment to technical excellence -- so it's time to
reposition. We need a new and better label.</p>

<p>I brainstormed this with some Silicon Valley fans of Linux
(including Larry Augustin of the <a href="http://www.li.org/">Linux
International</a> board of directors) the day after my meeting with
Netscape (Feb 5th). We kicked around and discarded several
alternatives, and we came up with a replacement label we all liked:
"open source".</p>

<p>We suggest that everywhere we as a culture have previously
talked about "free software", the label should be changed to "open
source". Open-source software. The open-source model. The open
source culture. The Debian Open Source Guidelines. (In pitching
this to the corporate world I'm also going to be invoking the idea
of "peer review" a lot.)</p>

<p>And, we should explain publicly the reason for the change. Linus
Torvalds has been saying in "World Domination 101" that the
open-source culture needs to make a serious effort to take the
desktop and engage the corporate mainstream. Of course he's right
-- and this re-labeling, as Linus agrees, is part of the process.
It says we're willing to work with and co-opt the market for our
own purposes, rather than remaining stuck in a marginal,
adversarial position.</p>

<p>This re-labeling has since attracted a lot of support (and some
opposition) in the hacker culture. Supporters include Linus
himself, John "maddog" Hall, Larry Augustin, Bruce Perens of <a
href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a>, Phil Hughes of <a
href="http://www.ssc.com">Linux Journal</a>. Opposers include
Richard Stallman, who initially flirted with the idea but now
thinks the term "open source" isn't pure enough.</p>

<p>Bruce Perens has applied to register "open source" as a
trademark and hold it through Software in the Public Interest. The
trademark conditions will be known as the ``Open Source
Definition'', essentially the same as the <a
href="http://www.debian.org/social_contract.html#guidelines">Debian
Free Software Guidelines</a>.</p>

<p>It's crunch time, people. The Netscape announcement changes
everything. We've broken out of the little corner we've been in for
twenty years. We're in a whole new game now, a bigger and more
exciting one -- and one I think we can win.</p>

<p>(A note about usage. In accordance with normal English practice,
the term is "open source" standing alone, but "open-source" used as
an adjective or in compounds; thus, "open-source software".)</p>

<p>(Yes, we're aware of the specialized meaning "open source" has
in the intelligence community. This is a feature, not a bug.)</p>
