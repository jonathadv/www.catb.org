<p>This page collects my projects that don't easily fit into either
the "software" or the "technical documentation" box.</p> 

<h1>Web resources I maintain</h1>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="cookbook/">The Unix Cookbook</a> &mdash; a collection of
working code illustrating various obscure corners of Unix and
Internet standards.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="BROWSER/index.html">The BROWSER Project</a>. What comes
next after PAGER, MAILER, and EDITOR? That's right...BROWSER. I'm
trying to spread a new convention for passing your browser
preference to application programs. Browse this page to see who
conforms and what work still needs to be done.</p></li>

<li><p><a
href="terminfo/">The terminfo/termcap database</a> &mdash; In January
1995 I accepted the maintainership of the BSD terminal-type
database from John Kunze. You can download it in either termcap or
terminfo form from here.</p></li>

<li><p><a
href="html-hell.html">The HTML Hell Page</a> &mdash; some curmudgeonly
comments on bad Web design.</p></li>

<li><p>My collection of <a href="fortunes">fortune cookies</a> on
liberty, politics, the Second Amendment, and other subjects. Most
are quotes from the Founding Fathers of the U.S, the sort of thing
that ought to be taught in high-school civics classes but isn't
anymore. Many people asked me to make these available on the Web
after seeing random selections in my mail signature.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="intercal/">The INTERCAL Resource Page</a>. The most
twisted computer language ever designed now has its own Web
page.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="sf-words/">An SF Glossary</a> This is a glossary of
terms and coinages used in science fiction. It describes main and
variant meanings and (where known) first usage and date of
inventions. Contributions and corrections are invited.</p></li>

<li><p>My collection of modes for the <a href="tengwar">Tengwar</a>,
including modes for Lojban and Esperanto. Soon to come: Volapuk and
Klingon.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/retro/">The
Retrocomputing Museum</a> &mdash; a collection of amusingly (and
horrifyingly) archaic languages, programming tools, machine emulators,
and games.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="magic-numbers">The Magic Numbers Home Page.</a> Daniel
Quinlan, Christos Zoulas, Greg Roelofs, myself and others are
attempting to build on the well-established Unix engineering
practice of file magic numbers to develop a semantic file type
system for the Internet. We're drafting an RFC and designing a file
type registry.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="magic/index.html">Alodar's Tower</a> &mdash; Resources for
players and fans of <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>. Includes
Alodar's Axioms for deck construction and recipes for many decks,
with explanations. (Yes, I've also contributed card designs to <a
href="http://www.sjgames.com/inwo/misc/utf.html">Usenet: The
Flaming</a>)</p></li>

<li><p><a href="riddle-poems.html">The Riddle-Poem Page</a> &mdash; all
about making and enjoying riddle-poems, a fun and stimulating game
for children and adults.</p></li>

<li><p><img src="ecsl/graphics/ecsllogo2.png" align="right" alt="" />
<a
href="ecsl/index.html">The Eric Conspiracy Page</a> &mdash; Yes, now the
blood-chilling truth behind all those sinister rumors can be
revealed. There <strong>is</strong> an Eric Conspiracy &mdash; and you
have fallen into its clutches. MUHAHAHAHEEHEE!</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>Other Things I'm Up To</h1>

<p>I have designed an fvwm2 layout you may find interesting if you
have a sufficiently large (1600x1200) monitor; see <a
href="fvwm2">Eric's Big Blue-Steel Desktop</a>.</p>

<h1>Projects now On Hold or Dead</h1>

<p>I used to publish a regular column of SF reviews in
rec.arts.sf.written called "Raymond's Reviews'. I stopped when I
lost my net access in 1993 and was too busy to resume it when I got
access again. They're <a href='sfreviews/'>archived here</a>.</p>

<p>I designed and maintain a netnews suite, TMNN-netnews, which
includes threading, security and modularity features not paralleled
in other news suites. This has become much less interesting as the
S/N ratio of USENET has plummeted.</p>

<h1>Past Projects</h1>

<p>Chester County InterLink was an effort to develop a truly
user-friendly and flexible Internet-access BBS. The project started
in September 1993; we went on-line in February 1994. We had over
2000 users as of our second anniversary and usage has continued to
rise since. You can <a href="telnet://locke.ccil.org">go there</a>,
log in as `guest' with password `guest', and check it out.</p>

<p><a href="trove/">Trove</a> is a project I launched because I
thought Sunsite was doomed. The classical model of Internet
software archive scales poorly, requiring too much maintainer
intervention. A better model of low-overhead, web-accessible
software databases is badly needed. Trove was going to be it, until
I got swamped. Fortunately the best ideas from Trove got picked up
by SourceForge.</p>

<p>From February 1997 to late 1998 I co-maintained the <a
href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/welcome.html">Sunsite</a>
archive, the largest and most popular software repository in the
Linux world (what is now Metalab). I designed and wrote <a
href="software.html#keeper">keeper</a>, the archiver's assistant
software now used to maintain that site.</p>

<p>I worked with the Linux File System Standards Group and
representatives from the BSD UNIX community to generalize the Linux
File System Standard so it would define a common directory layout
for open-source UNIX operating systems.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnu.org"><img
src="graphics/gnu-head-sm.jpg" alt="" width="65" height="61"
align="right" /></a> I was heavily involved in the GNU Emacs 19
development (in fact, I was the primary Emacs-lisp library person
for about two years during 1991-1993). The vc.el mode for one-touch
version control within Emacs was mine. So was the gud.el mode for
universal debugger control, and the package-finder feature under
the Emacs help system. I also wrote the support for package
unloading in the Emacs 19 kernel.</p>

<p>I was for a couple of years an active member of the nethack
developers' list. I wrote the color support, introduced blindfolds,
and edited the `Guide to the Mazes Of Menace', the nethack
manual.</p>

<p>I added many of the new features in pcomm-2.0, the UNIX clone of
ProComm written and maintained by Emmet Gray, including the
point-and-shoot dialer interface and the support for Zmodem-upload
autorecognition.</p>

<p>I was one of the principal developers of the ncurses library,
the open-source clone of System V curses distributed with
Linux.</p>

<h1>Future Projects</h1>

<p>I am particularly interested in helping realize the following
potentials of the Internet:</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Cooperative distributed open-source development</strong></dt>

<dd>I think the Linux development project is an exciting model for
what is possible in the way of decentralized cooperation on the
Internet. I would like to help develop tools to assist in
network-distributed software development, version control, and
documentation support.</dd>

<dt><strong>Promoting PGP and other technologies for digital
privacy</strong></dt>

<dd>I have been a member of the cypherpunks list and will rejoin
when I free up some time. I am very interested in technologies that
promote individual freedom by making it difficult for governments
and corporations to control or monitor network activity.</dd>
</dl>

<h1>Sadly, I Too Am Mortal...</h1>

<p>I want these projects to survive me. If you are reading this
page and have information that I am dead, disappeared, seriously
injured or otherwise unable to maintain a net.presence, take a look
at my <a href="continuity.html">continuity page</a>.</p>
