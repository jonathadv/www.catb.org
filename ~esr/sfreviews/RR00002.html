<p>Donald Moffit proved in <cite>The Genesis Quest</cite> and
<cite>Second Genesis</cite> that he is one of the gifted few who
can write sense-of-wonder hard SF that both satisfies and gets the
details right. These books aren't quite the riveting epics his last
two were, but they are a damn sight better than most writers
<em>ever</em> do -- and, arguably, his aims were different this
time around.</p>

<p>We start with Abdul Hamid-Jones, a cloning technician in an
Islam-dominated high-technology culture spanning the Solar System
and a few nearby stars. In the first volume, our unwilling hero
finds himself caught up in a deadly whirl of politico-religious
intrigue when the despotic Emir of Mars's scheduled body transplant
is disrupted by a terrorist attack. Eventually he is forced to flee
to the Martian deserts, where the Bedouin ride gene-adapted
Marscamels between tented and domed `oases'. While on raid with
them he is recaptured by the black hats, rescued in turn by another
underground group and eventually packed off (in disguise) to Alpha
Centauri on a wooden starship.</p>

<p>The second volume more than satisfies the expectations set up by
the first. What can you say about a writer with enough chutzpah and
a slick enough line in speculative engineering to make you believe
in wood-and-cloth starships and a scheme to sling entire solar
systems around at relativistic velocities without rattling teacups
on their inhabited planets? (I know what I can say... MORE!
MORE!).</p>

<p>The atmosphere of these two novels veers from thrillingly
dramatic to near slapstick, with Moffitt never <em>quite</em>
losing control of the narrative. Jones's giddy pursuit of an
overblown, mercenary `beauty' (the boss's daughter) and his frantic
everything-I-do-gets-me-in-deeper attempts to untangle himself from
several vicious but incompetent underground groups provide plenty
of chuckles.</p>

<p>But don't get the idea that Moffit sacrifices any world-building
precision to get cheap yucks. Except for one eminently pardonable
and necessary McGuffin (the Harun Drive) the physics and biology
are all quite conservative (no FTL drives or antigravity in this
universe). One precise dissection of the energy requirements of
starships in the second volume (which demonstates, among other
things, why Bussard ramscoops are unworkable) is worth the price of
admission by itself.</p>

<p>And, oh, does Moffitt have <em>fun</em> with it all. You will
too -- this book is <em>definitely</em> a good read in the classic
SF sense. May the beneficient Allah rain his blessings on Donald
Moffitt, so that we see many more from this major and
too-little-recognized talent!</p>
