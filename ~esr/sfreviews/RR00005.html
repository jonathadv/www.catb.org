<p>This novel is a prequel to Perry's Khadaji trilogy (<cite>The
Man Who Never Missed</cite>, <cite>Matadora</cite>, <cite>The
Machiavelli Interface</cite>) in which he told the epic story of
the man who destroyed a corrupt, militaristic interstellar
confederation by mythologizing himself into a hero-martyr for the
resistance. Emile Antoon Khadaji, before he became The Man Who
Never Missed, was trained in the ultimate martial art by one Pen, a
Brother of the Siblings of the Shroud. <cite>The 97th Step</cite>
is Pen's story.</p>

<p>All four of these novels are variations on a common motif
adopted into SF and fantasy from American contact with oriental
martial arts -- the warror-mystic as savior. At its best, this sort
of thing can have a deal of mythic resonance and power. At its
worst (as in the horrible recent examples of Michael Gear's
<cite>Spider</cite> novels or Don Wismer's <cite>Planet of the
Dead</cite>) it can simply provide an excuse for uttering reams of
cookie-cutter-interchangeable chop-sockey -- a sort of cheap
carno-porn in which nothing but the body count really matters, and
what minimal interest the books hold is in their loving and
precisionist descriptions of the technology of mayhem.</p>

<p>Perry's books aren't great literature by any means, but they're
written with an economy and occasional wryness that lifts them
above most others of this subgenre. Also, Perry has taken the time
to do some fairly detailed world-building. This was implicit in the
Khadaji books, but <cite>The 97th Step</cite> actually includes two
short appendices full of charming factoids.</p>

<p>Yes, there is violence galore and a lot of
absorbing-wisdom-at-the-feet-of- the-masters scenes that will bore
you cold if you don't care for that sort of thing. But if you do,
be reassured that the mysticism presented here is a rather crisp
and pro-rational variety that doesn't overplay its hand. And the
violence, though it's written to thrill, isn't prettied up. As in
reality, good people can die brutally and heroes can't count on
sailing through crises without losing something real.</p>

<p>Can <cite>Star Wars</cite> really claim as many of these
virtues?</p>
