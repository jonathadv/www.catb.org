<p>This book is very boring, and that's sad.</p>

<p>Isaac Asimov's enormous popularity has never been built on
pulse-pounding action, steamy romance, evocative prose, or subtle
and complex character- ization. Not to put too fine a point on it,
his oeuvre consists primarily of talking-heads scenes wired
together by perfunctory plotting.</p>

<p>Now, this is not necessarily a Bad Thing. In Dr. Asimov's
stories the Idea is King. If you are sufficiently stimulated by
Ideas (and many SF fans including this reviewer are) good ones can
more than make up for the lack of conventional story-telling
virtues. In Asimov's work the ideas have often been fascinating,
and so his work has achieved great success among fans of the
genre.</p>

<p>The problem with <cite>Nemesis</cite> is that its Ideas are
either nonexistent or hackneyed. Did we really need another novel
in which the day is saved by a misfit 15-year-old with Special
Powers? Another in which the villain is a megalomaniac
el-maximum-lider out to prevent mongrel Earthmen from pol- luting
the vital bodily fluids of his Settler flock? Another in which the
plot turns on the establishment of telepathic contact with a lonely
planetary hive-mind?</p>

<p>And all these cliches are swathed about by <em>endless</em>
reams of talk-talk. And the only character who comes even
<em>partly</em> to life (i.e. does anything at all surprising after
introduction) is an obvious mouthpiece for the author. And the
attempts to write `relationship' scenes mostly come off as though
the characters were bloodless geriatrics in a cosmic trailer park.
And...oh, I can't go on. Suffice it to say that if the manuscript
had been submitted by an unknown it would doubtless have been
bounced hard enough to achieve escape velocity.</p>

<p>Dr. Asimov has written much better in the recent past, and we
can hope he will do so in the future. This one, though, wins the
first Raymond's Reviews Golden Turkey award for Conspicuous Waste
of Paper by a Major Talent.</p>

<p>Note: despite Dr. Asimov's introductory disclaimer, the book
(especially the last 20 pages) is loaded with foreshadowings and
references that tie it to the Foundation/Robots future history; in
particular, it sheds a considerable light on the origins of the
Spacer culture. Completists may wish to plow through it for that
reason alone.</p>
