<p><cite>Gifts</cite> is an odd and interesting book, a sort of
ecological space-opera quite different in tone and style from Paul
Williams's previous work (the 7-volume epic of post-holocaust
reconstruction called the Pelbar Cycle).</p>

<p>As our story opens, a Gorboduc exploration ship is attacked and
destroyed by the planetary defences of a world called Landsdrum.
The Landsdrumites, knowing of the Gorboducs only that their
language is that spoken by a feared group of "vandal" plunderers
who once raided Landsdrum for tribute.</p>

<p>All but one of the Gorboducs elect to die in conformance with
their culture's harsh warrior code. One, the scientist Umber
Trreggevthann, believes he has knowledge that is so vital to his
peoples' survival that he must remain alive even at the cost of his
honor. For the "vandals", the Dark Sector Gorboducs, are but one of
seven Gorboduc cultures, and they hold Umber's people in
thrall.</p>

<p>He allows himself to be slave-bonded to a Landsdrum family,
enduring the scorn of his shipmates before their honorable suicides
-- and straightaway begins to disrupt the local culture. For Umber
is a biologist; his expedition was collecting species to enrich the
biome of his homeworld, and he succeeds in releasing some breeding
pairs he brought down on the lifepod.</p>

<p>Unbeknownst to him, Landsdrum is a semi-theocracy organized
around a religion with some dogmas about biology which the new
species utterly disrupt. Even saving the colony from a dangerous
periodic plague using his offworld knowledge isn't enough to
deflect the wrath of the church -- and, as if that isn't bad
enough, he knows that the true Vandals will be arriving before too
long to raid Landsdrum, and that one of the things they will surely
due if Lansdrum's ill-prepared defenses don't send them packing is
torture him to death for treason.</p>

<p>Are we having fun yet? And I haven't even mentioned his
<em>real</em> problem. The information he carries makes it utterly
necessary that he get back to his own people -- who must, by their
laws, turn him over to the Vandals. The only real allies he has are
Landsdrum's semisentient food animals, and <em>they</em> are mostly
interested in playing obscure mathematical games!</p>

<p>This book is funny, dramatic, touching, and unusual. Stories of
one man of knowledge toppling an entire culture's worldview aren't
uncommon in SF, but treatments of the theme this peculiar and
convincing are. Umber's problems aren't quite resolved by the last
page and there are strong hints of a sequel in the offing. I'll be
looking forward to it.</p>
