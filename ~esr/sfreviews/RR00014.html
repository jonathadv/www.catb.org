<p>In <a href="RR00004.html">RR#4</a> I commented on the
persistance of the starpilot-as-magus theme in modern SF, and how
it ties in with human needs for transcendence and our culture's
ideas about technology and the individual.</p>

<p>In <cite>Falcon</cite>, Emma Bull picks up this motif but never
quite seems to decide what she wants to do with it. It's an odd
sort of failure from the woman who wrote that excellent fantasy,
<cite>The War For The Oaks</cite>. The story is very conventional.
The protagonist, Niki, is a misfit in his royal family who wants to
chuck the trappings of aristocracy and be a starpilot. His plans
are disrupted by an engineered revolution that wipes out his
family. He flees, disappears and resurfaces as a `gestalt pilot' --
one of a special breed who trade supernal ability for addiction to
an enabling drug that destroys their metabolisms within years.</p>

<p>So far, so good. Other authors have certainly similar motifs
into books that were lots of fun and even had some important things
to say. But after Niki resurfaces <cite>Falcon</cite> seems to lose
its direction; the rest of the book reads like a good deal of sound
and fury signifying not very much. This is a shame, because Niki
has been developed into an interesting and sympathetic
character.</p>

<p>The ending of the book suggests that Ms. Bull was trying to
write a novel about character and virtue. The obvious
action-adventure-revenge possibilities are worked out partway and
then dropped, apparently to make a psychological point (even the
eventual confrontation with the family's betrayer lacks zip). The
trouble is that Niki does his growing in the first part and the
hiatus between parts one and two -- the latter half of the novel
doesn't seem to take him anywhere, psychologically, despite a final
poor-little-superman fillip that looks regrettably as though it was
tacked on as an afterthought.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, this book does have some distinct virtues.
Characterization is strong throughout, and especially in the first
part of the novel. Niki is engaging, and the world has some nice
detail touches. It is really only at the end of it all that the
apparent problems in concept become obtrusive -- perhaps other
readers will find a redeeming subtlety there that I missed.
Overall, I can't recommend this novel -- but I won't pan it,
either, and will be curious to see what Ms. Bull's second foray
into the SF field looks like.</p>
