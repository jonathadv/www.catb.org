<p>In <cite>The Name Of The Rose</cite> Umberto Eco demonstrated
that a book exhibiting many of the diagnostic obsessions of Serious
Literature could nevertheless be both a gripping read and
accessible to those of us in the unwashed masses who've never taken
a degree in higher literary persiflage. In <cite>Foucault's
Pendulum</cite>, alas, the obsessions are still there but many of
the qualities that made the earlier book special and accessible are
not.</p>

<p>What's that you say? Why am I writing about this book in a
column of SF &amp; fantasy reviews? Well...actually, because I feel
like it. But if you want a literary rationalization, you can
consider genre SF and the sort of thing Eco writes to both depend
on "cognitive estrangement", that is the use of plausible
fabrications to displace the reader into a secondary world in which
(and this is the crucial point) the <em>rules</em> are different
from those of the consensus reality we experience daily; a sort of
writing in in which an escalating series of shocks to our
preconceptions is <em>intended</em> by the author. This is why
litteratoors tend to lump the few SF novels they condescend to
notice with the works of fabulists like Jorge Luis Borges,
allegories like Apuleius's <cite>The Golden Ass</cite>, or the
contemporary "magic realists".</p>

<p>And indeed, a major theme of both <cite>Rose</cite> and
<cite>Pendulum</cite> is that, to the extent the humans live in an
empire of words, the rules can be changed by anyone intelligent or
insane enough to transvaluate those words.</p>

<p>The major characters in <cite>Pendulum</cite> are three
intellectuals at a vanity-publishing firm that makes most of its
money from verious sorts of occultists and a mass-market line of
occult and conspiracy literature for the overly credible. As a
joke, they compose an interpretation of history that recasts it as
a struggle between secret societies struggling to regain the lost
cosmic secrets of the Knights Templar. The joke, however, swiftly
begins to assume a sinister reality, and people connected with it
disappear mysteriously...</p>

<p>Perhaps I was spoiled for <cite>Pendulum</cite> by having read
Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson's <cite>Illuminatus</cite>
trilogy, which handles much the same themes as
<cite>Pendulum</cite> in a far zanier and more effective way. Eco's
narrative loses considerable impact if the reader already knows
about and has laughed at the hoary edifice of occult conspiracy
theory, with its bizarre parade of magi, Assassins,
revolutionaries, secret Masonic lodges, notional cities under the
earth, world-girdling sinister plans and inspired madmen.</p>

<p>The book can be read as a lesson about how easy and dangerous it
is to confuse Word with Reality (Eco even quotes Korzybski's famous
admonition "The map is not the territory" in one of the later
chapter headings). For the three, eventually, lose their sanities
and themselves in "the Plan" -- and, because they are not the only
ones seduced by their artifice, so do certain others. The book
climaxes with a grisly ritual held beneath Foucault's Pendulum, one
in which their words become flesh.</p>

<p>Eco's attempt afterwards at a grand philosophical summation of
What It All Meant falls rather flat, though. Shea &amp; Wilson
aren't necessarily better weriters, but they are better
psychopomps. Read <cite>Illuminatus</cite> before you bother with
<cite>Pendulum</cite>, if you bother at all -- but, in any case,
don't miss the marvelous discussion on page 378 and following, on
the Kabalistic interpretation of automobile owners' manuals.</p>
