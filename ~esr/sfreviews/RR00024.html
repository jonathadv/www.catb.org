<p>This first novel is SF the way they used to write 'em -- the
Idea As Hero, hardware sticking out every which way but loose, damn
the characterization and full speed ahead. One imagines the ghost
of George O. Smith hovering benignly over the author's
shoulder.</p>

<p>This sort of thing only works if you've got at least several
mind-bending ideas to wrap your plot around, and have the training
to follow out the implications with the fanatical logic and
precision of a design engineer. There's a strong tendency for the
prose voices of such authors to all sound the same, as crisp and
mechanical as one of their gedankenmachines. Which explains why
you're likely to need to pinch yourself and check the cover of this
one twice to rid yourself of the delusion that you're reading a
James Hogan or Robert Forward novel. But no; that's Appleby,
A-p-p-l-e-b-y.</p>

<p><cite>The Voice Of Cepheus</cite> is a first-contact novel. As
it begins, a near-future SETI project picks up an intense
"attention signal" from the constellation Cepheus. They deduce that
is a pointer to another transmission, much fainter but carrying
millions of bits of encoded information. The second message turns
out to be a physics text which implies instructions on how to build
an FTL communicator. This is when the fun really starts, as our
protagonists must intrigue to prevent the great-power governments
from monopolizing the signal and abusing the Cepheans' information
for political purposes.</p>

<p>Once that challenge is met, the greater one of building and
testing the "gecom" must be met. There is drama in deep space as
the first attempt nearly destroys the experimental team; and a
greater mystery afterward once they make contact. For no one can
say for sure what the Cepheans' motives in building their beacon
were -- and the man who began the whole sequence believes they are
hiding a dangerous truth.</p>

<p>Appleby's kind of writing is an acquired taste. If you liked
<cite>Venus Equilateral</cite> and <cite>Flight Of The
Dragonfly</cite> and <cite>The Genesis Machine</cite> you will eat
it up like so much technofudge -- I did. You'll even laugh
tolerantly at Appleby's lame attempt at romantic subplot. If, on
the other hand, you <em>don't</em> like yours with rivets you'll
find <cite>Voice</cite> to be just so much incomprehensible
garble.</p>

<p>In sum, <cite>The Voice Of Cepheus</cite> gets the Raymond's
Reviews Chrome-Plated Doohickey award for combining gloriously
mind-boggling ideas with trite mechanical prose Just The Way They
Useta Way Back When. You Have Been Warned -- but <em>I</em> hope we
hear more from this guy, whether he "learns to write" or not!</p>
