<p>This once the back-cover blurb doesn't lie -- if you liked
Spider Robinson's <cite>Callahan's Bar</cite> stories, you will
love <cite>Callahan's Lady</cite> -- and the bordello she runs that
does with sex what Callahan's did with booze. Several Callahan's
Bar regulars (including Mike himself, Ralph Von Wau Wau, Fast Eddie
and Jake) make cameo appearances, and there is the expected ration
of comedy, drama, and awful puns. I enjoyed the Callahan's Bar
stories a lot, and I enjoyed this book a lot too.</p>

<p>And yet, and yet...here, as in much of Spider Robinson's
writing, there lurks a sense of something unfinished, unconvincing,
immature. Perhaps it's the density and obviousness of the Heinlein
references. Perhaps it's Spider's wide-eyed faith in easy victories
over hard problems, the tendency his stuff has to fall into a
half-hour-with-three-breaks-for-our-sponsor dramedy format, with
everything wrapped up in a neat little bow at the last frame.
Perhaps it's the very earnestness with which he works to wrap every
story around an ethical point of some sort.</p>

<p>The total effect is pleasant and superficially involving, but
too clever in spots and a touch preachy -- a lot like the old Trek
episodes Gene Roddenberry used to turn out when he was feeling
high-minded. The characters will grab you quickly and stay with you
after you've finished the book, but you'll never quite believe in
them as real human beings -- they're too perfect.</p>

<p>Occasionally (as in <cite>Telempath</cite> or <cite>Night of
Power</cite>) Spider has created worlds and characters that are
more complex, more convincing -- that reflect more of the quiet
ambiguity human beings generally live in. Why he so often settles
for writing fluffy, didactic morality playlets like the ones
collected in <cite>Callahan's Lady</cite> is a really interesting
question.</p>

<p>Maybe they're part of his continuing homage to Heinlein. The old
man, after all, had more than a touch of the didactic moralist in
him. Well, I loved and revered RAH too, but if this is what's going
on, Spider Robinson's true authorial voice needs to get out from
under. The Master was the Master, a law unto himself. Neither
Spider nor anybody else will ever write more than ersatz Heinlein
-- and I'd rather read a first-rate Robinson than ersatz anything,
any day.</p>
