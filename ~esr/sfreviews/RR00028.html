<p>No, this isn't the 60Kword <cite>Rocheworld</cite> serial from
<cite>Analog</cite>, nor a reprint of the 1984 100Kword
<cite>Flight Of The Dragonfly</cite> from Timescape, nor the 1985
110Kwd re-release from Baen; this is the all-singing, all-dancing
155Kword author-approved fusion-powered 1990 mega-edition -- and I
wish I could manage not to wince and grit my teeth reading it.</p>

<p>As usual (i.e. as in his previous novels <cite>Dragon's
Egg</cite> and <cite>Starquake</cite>) Bob Forward has a lot of
nifty ideas; unfortunately, his prose is so leaden and his
characters such an improbable collection of tissue-thin cardboard
superpeople and far-too-humanlike aliens that I for one just cannot
swallow the whole without gagging. More length has made the problem
worse, which is a shame; the earlier versions squeaked in
underneath my bad-writing tolerance, but the first hundred pages of
this one ran right up agin' it.</p>

<p>However -- if you can persevere through these obstacles, you
will have lots of fun with the laser physics and the Christmas Bush
and the surfing aliens and all the other stuff Forward does so
well. A quick teaser for those who missed it the first time
around:</p>

<p>Sometime in the middle of the next century, the
<cite>Prometheus</cite> sails to the stars on gossamer wings.
Massive laser arrays in Sol System accelerate it by lightsail for a
four-decade trip, with its crew of 20 kept on life-extension drugs
that have the unfortunate side effect of reducing them to idiocy,
and tended by watchful AIs. Though the mission is nearly scuttled
by a bizarre medical crisis, the craft arrives safely at its
destination -- Barnard's Star.</p>

<p>Previous lightsail probes had mapped the Barnard system, a
circus of weird phenomena of which perhaps the oddest is
Rocheworld. Two elliptical lobes tumble about a common barycenter,
separated by barely 80km and sharing a single atmospheric envelope.
The dumbbell-shaped gravitational field and ammonia/water oceans
produce many truly weird planetographic effects, which Forward
delightedly works out to a degree of precision that would bore
anybody but an I'll-take-mine-with -rivets-thank-you hard-SF fan
like me to utter distraction.</p>

<p>Then the fun really starts. For, of course, the hardy crew of
the Prometheus discovers intelligent life. Actually, it's the
computer on their exploration VTOL (Jill, a character rendered more
three-dimensionally than most of the humans) who makes the
discovery. These are the flouwen, multi-ton amorphous blobs who
live for abstract mathematics and the Big Wave.</p>

<p>Sigh. I wish to hell Forward could write at least as well as,
say, James Hogan or Ken Appleby (see <a
href="RR00025.html">RR#25</a>). Because while you're trying to
suspend disbelief and go for all this you're constantly getting
flogged by characterization as painfully bad and cute as a pink
tutu on a hippo. It's like every once in a while the author
remembers that his talking heads are supposed to be people, so he
has them coyly fuck each other. And the relationships don't make
any <em>sense</em>....</p>

<p>Oh well, never mind. If you're the kind who gets off on
explanations of how disequilibrated ammonia/H20 mixtures near their
triple point can produce both underwater snowstorms and the raddest
tubular breakers this side of Diamond Head, you'll eat this book up
with a fork. If not -- well, don't say you weren't warned.</p>
