<p>Jerry Earl Brown's 1981 debut, <cite>Under The City Of
Angels</cite>, was an eerie and gripping SF novel that attracted
far less attention than it should have. I missed
<cite>Darkhold</cite>, which this one lists on a flyleaf; but
<cite>Earthfall</cite> is nearly as good -- less impressive only
because it takes fewer chances, and for another reason (not the
author's fault) which I'll get to shortly.</p>

<p>Some hundreds of years in the future, the nations of Earth have
destroyed themselves and much of the planet's ecology, leaving the
planet a wasteland inhabited by fierce mutants and a few remnant
humans. A high-tech human civilization still exists in space, but
(as in John McLaughlin's <cite>Helix And The Sword</cite>) has
turned its back on the mother world, girdling it with a network of
satellite sentries to destroy woild-be visitors.</p>

<p>Chia Swann is a terraphile, one of the minority that feels drawn
back to the home world. She risks everything to land and walk
there, the first spacer to do so in as long as her culture publicly
remembers. In the Valley of Mexico, one of the few areas still
habitable, she first sees evidence that human tribes still roam the
shattered landscape, then encounters Stares-At-Nothing, an outcast
boy who heals the sick and has pre-visions of the future. She flees
to orbit and is declared outlaw by the InterWorld Federation.</p>

<p>IWF has its own agenda. Somewhere in the Valley, near the place
the Aztecs called the City Of Sorcerers, is the ruins of a Russian
safehouse believed to contain the plans for a prototype FTL drive.
The IWF's ruthless director, Allin Yaelu, is ready to break the ban
on Earth and land troops there to get them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a drifter named O'Rourke rides into the Valley from
the North, struggling against memories too terrible to bear. And
the mutant chieftain Sikatre, the man who slaughtered
Stares-at-Nothing's tribe, has plans of his own. Events propel
Swann and Yaelu and the Earthers towards a collision that could
finish the death of the Earth or send humanity to the stars.</p>

<p>This is good stuff, even if the post-holocaust background is a
mite on the conventional side. But the biggest problem with it is
its timing. It's getting harder to believe in post-holocaust SF at
all these days, with the General Secretary of the Soviet Communist
Party talking about "moving to free economic relations and a
full-blooded market" and the Red Chinese looking increasingly
isolated and vulnerable.</p>

<p>No -- if we humans manage to do ourselves in, it's increasingly
clear that we'll do it by polluting ourselves into a slow
environmental collapse, going with a whimper rather than a bang.
And given the near-certainty of an active nanotechnology within the
next century even that seems less and less likely.
<cite>Earthfall</cite>'s real problem is that it's been overtaken
by events; the whole subgenre it belongs to is already
obsolete.</p>

<p>And frankly, that doesn't upset me at <em>all</em>. :-)</p>
