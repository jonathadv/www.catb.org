<p>There's a large subgenre of contemporary fantasy written by
women I think of as "Marion Zimmer Bradley Wannabees" that clogs
the shelves of chain bookstore all over the US. An "MZB-wannabee"
author and book can be spotted by presence of most of the following
diagnostics:</p>

<ol>
<li>The protagonist and/or a majority of the strong characters are
female, and one of them is an obvious idealized projection of the
author.</li>

<li>The prose-construction is passable -- not great, but not
odoriferously awful either.</li>

<li>The characterization is better than SF's average, with
protagonist and supporting characters often quite engaging.</li>

<li>The world-building is shoddy in the extreme, combining
derivative fantasy elements with a romanticized, anachronism-laden
SCA version of medieval or dark-ages Europe (my girlfriend calls
this the "medieval mystery-meat" effect).</li>

<li>Either the book has explicit political feminism as an obvious
subtext <em>or</em> the range of possibilities assumed for women in
pre-industrial, pre-birth-control societies is unrealistically
wide.</li>

<li>The book seems aimed at adolescent females and young women and
often has the structure of a bildungsroman.</li>

<li>The acquisition of magical power is treated as an allegory of
sexual maturation and often confused with it.</li>

<li>The author has three names (and uses them all) and hails from
California (spiritually if not geographically :-)).</li>
</ol>

<p>Most of the implausible parade of sword-wielding leather-strap
women that have infested fantasy lately obviously stepped out of
MZB-wannabee daydreams of one kind -- and then there's the other,
the young-sorceress-learning-to-use-her-powers book. Julie Dean
Smith's <cite>Call Of Madness</cite> is a very typical example of
this type.</p>

<p>Athaya Trelaine is the unhappy princess of Caithe, a small
kingdom where the Church traditionally kills the `Lorngeld' (those
born to magic) when they begin to come into their powers. Her
unfeeling father and shrewish stepmother (yes, there's an evil
stepmother) drive her to seek dangerous excitements in low places.
Part of what ails her is her unconsummated affair with the captain
of the palace guard, a good man she wants desperately to marry but
cannot.</p>

<p>She shares the Caitheans' prejudices against the Lorngeld, and
so is doubly shocked when she discovers that she is one of them
herself. She knows that her father, who has some magical skill but
is not Lorngeld, is working to end the killing; she fears that
disclosure of her secret would force her into marriage with the
Lorngeld prince of a neighboring kingdom that values its mageborn.
But while she keeps the secret she can get no training in her
powers, and an untrained Lorngeld is doomed to madness and a
self-destructive end...</p>

<p>Well, it's all fairly predictable from there. There's nothing
overtly <em>wrong</em> with this book, if you can ignore the
paper-mache stage settings and cliche-ridden plot. If you can deal
with it on those terms, it's even enjoyable in its own clumsy,
earnest way. I give it the first Raymond's Review Rhinestone
Starstone Award for Conspicuous MZB-wannabeeness. Enjoy it, if you
can.</p>
