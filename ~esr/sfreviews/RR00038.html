<p>If mannered high fantasy after the mode of Clark Ashton Smith,
Lord Dunsany, James Branch Cabell or E. R. Eddison is your dish of
tea, you will enjoy this book. The dedication says this was
Schweitzer's first novel, and it has the feel sometimes of a finger
exercise in emulation of a style which he obviously loves very
much.</p>

<p>The elaborate prose, the high-medieval flavor of the world, the
visual gorgeousness of description, the pure-archetype characters
-- it's all there, and lots of fun if you like That Sort Of Thing
(I do, occasionally).</p>

<p>The major problem with this book is that the genre conventions
make it too predictable. As Evnos the brilliant boy-prince of
Iankorous marries the fair Riacinera we <em>know</em> that the
couple is doomed; as the wizard Theremderis tells Evnos of the
curse on his family's heirloom blade, we <em>know</em> that the
Prince will eventually wield it in some terrible act which will
bring down his house.</p>

<p>Personally, I find it very difficult to read stories about
inexorable tragic dooms, not so much because of the grief and pain
depicted in the victims but because of their utter
<em>helplessness</em>. For all that Prince Evnos superficially
appears to make choices, it is clear from prophecy and
foreshadowing and atmosphere that his end has been fated from the
beginning of time.</p>

<p>Thus it is that no one in the story ever emerges as a fully
human being. Denied by their setting the capacity to make their own
choices and thus develop as autonomous individuals, Evnos and
Theremderis and all the rest are simply roles in a shadow-play.</p>

<p>I suspect Schweitzer's answer would begin by observing that he
was aiming at a mythic quality in the narrative, and that myth is
like that. But even myth, in general, does not convey quite as
crushing a fatalism as we see implied in <cite>The White
Isle</cite>. Even in Genesis it is not made to seem that the Fall
of Man was fated.</p>

<p>The characters in E. R. Eddison's <cite>The Worm
Ourobouros</cite> (a book stylistically very like this one) were
doomed to an eternal round of heroism and tragedy, fated in the
strictest sense. Eddison, though, did not try to pull the reader
into a strong identification with any one; in his day the cult of
the novel of character had not yet come to dominate literature.
Thus, Eddison's novel is intense but not emotionally bruising.</p>

<p>In <cite>The White Isle</cite>, though, Schweitzer both dooms
his shadow players and (in subtle ways) pulls the reader into
strong identification with them. The result (for me at least)
leaves me feeling as though my spirit has been mugged and beaten
up. I admire Mr. Schweitzer's authorial skill but cannot really
enjoy the use to which it has been put.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is simply a quirk of mine that I cannot romanticize
pain and grief and loss very well, nor enjoy the sensation of fear
(I don't read horror fiction, ever). If you don't share my
aversions, you will probably be able to enjoy the stylistic
gorgeousness of this book more wholeheartedly than I did. I
particularly commend it to fantasy/horror fans looking for a taste
of how they wrote 'em in the old days.</p>
