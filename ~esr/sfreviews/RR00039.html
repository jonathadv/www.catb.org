<p>In <cite>The Fires Of Paratime</cite> (1982) and <cite>Hammer Of
Darkness</cite> (1985), L. E. Modesitt demonstrated a powerfully
unconventional imagination yoked to a writing talent not then quite
mature enough to handle the demands made on it.</p>

<p>By 1986's <cite>The Ecologic Envoy</cite> Modesitt had retreated
to a more conventional sort of adventure/intrigue SF, but was
displaying greatly improved plotting and world-building. That novel
chronicled a confrontation between a militaristic and repressive
galactic empire and the eco-technologists of the independent world
Accord, as told from the point of view of one Nathaniel Firstborn
Whaler.</p>

<p>In <cite>The Ecolitan Operation</cite> (1989), Modesitt returned
to the universe of Accord but in an earlier century, when Accord
was still an Imperial colony struggling to throw off the yoke. We
followed the adventures of Major Jimjoy Earl Wright, Special
Operative and primo tough-guy of the Empire's department of dirty
tricks. Condemned to death after one of his missions backfires on
the Empire, he flees to Accord, finds there something he can begin
to believe in, and takes on the job of defending it against his
former colleagues.</p>

<p><cite>The Ecologic Secession</cite> continues that story. The
Ecolitan Institute gives Wright the new identity of James Joyson
Whaler and a job as the planet's de-facto war leader. The Empire
vastly outguns, outnumbers and outspends little Accord; its only
weapon is the Institute's subtle grasp on the multiple ecologies
(biological, economic, and informational) of the human Galaxy.</p>

<p>In this second book, though, the revolution is not
Wright/Whaler's most difficult problem. His ultimate challenge is
to reshape not just the Galaxy but his own nature -- because the
culture he has adopted and the woman he wants more than anything
else can <em>use</em> the ruthless, lethal super-operative that he
has made himself, but will never accept that creature as a human
being. Killing is so much <em>simpler</em> than loving...</p>

<p>In <cite>The Ecologic Secession</cite> Modesitt tries to marry
the conventional SF/adventure saga to the novel of character. He
isn't quite good enough to carry it off convincingly -- but then,
very few writers are. And even though this book and its prequel
come up short on that level, I found them enjoyable and well worth
reading for Modesitt's world-building and the nice visceral grab of
many of the action scenes.</p>

<p>What I'd really like to see is the new Modesitt's skill married
to the old Modesitt's willingness to take conceptual chances. The
Ecolitan Institute could yet develop in a direction that lets him
do that; we really don't learn all <em>that</em> much about its
ideas from the three books so far, except that all of its
disciplines incorporate the wisdom that you can never do only one
thing.</p>

<p>I'll be watching for more signs of growth in his next book.</p>
