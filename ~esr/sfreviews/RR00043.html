<p>Perhaps I'm in a minority, but I wish Gordon Dickson would stick
to writing humor like <cite>Spacepaw</cite> and the
<cite>Hoka</cite> stories. As the years go on, each of his
`serious' novels gets more stiff and sententious, and the
bargain-basement Nietzscheanism that passes for philosophical
content gets more tiresome (and sometimes perilously approaches
Fascist worship of the genetic volk-hero). I'm afraid the best I
can say for this latest eruption is that it's not as awesomely,
grandiosely bad as was <cite>The Final Encyclopedia</cite>.</p>

<p>Let's start with the premise. The U.S. is supposed to have
undergone a collapse so serious that transport, communications and
food distribution totally break down and large fractions of the
population die or revert to barbarism -- <em>without</em> the
excuse of warfare or ecological collapse and with the country's
infrastructure and physical plant essentially intact! No one who's
seen the speed with which modern market economies recover from even
the effects of major warfare is going to manage to believe this for
two seconds.</p>

<p>Ah, but Dickson believes in Inexorable Trends of History. His
protagonist, Jeebee Walthar, is one of the developers of
"Quantitative Social Dynamics". He is trekking across the ruined
U.S. to his brother's ranch, where he hopes to somehow perfect the
theory and use it to (re)build a stable civilization. This wasn't a
very credible notion even when Asimov originated it in the
<cite>Foundation</cite> series four decades ago; in the 1990s
(after chaos theory and the persistent failures of predictive
economic modelling) it's gotten pretty threadbare. Still, if it
weren't for the novel's other flaws I could manage to suspend
disbelief in this much.</p>

<p>Along the way, Jeebee befriends a wolf. The wolf is a far more
interesting and competent character than Jeebee. They fall in with
a trio of peddlers; one is a predictably young and beautiful woman
with whom Jeebee predictably falls in love. Are we cliched out
yet?</p>

<p>The book takes a 90-degree turn along with Jeebee's course when
he leaves the peddlers to strike north towards his brother's ranch.
Mauled by a bear, he loses weeks recovering and finds he must
winter over in a cave. The rest of the narrative is a sort of cross
between the Swiss Family Robinson and a Louis L'Amour western, as
Jeebee toughens up and slowly builds and scavenges what he needs
for survival. Eventually (and highly improbably) his sweetheart
finds her way to him and they settle down to an idyllic B-movie
Frontier Family existence with their wolf and a baby, Quantum
Social Dynamics and the rest of the world completely forgotten.
Sheesh!</p>

<p>What we have here is the front end of a rather mediocre
after-the-holocaust SF novel grafted on to the rear end of a
survivalist tract. And the writing...oy vey iz mir, the
<em>writing</em>! Except for the scenes with Wolf and a couple of
action sequences it plods like a broken-down truck horse.
Philosophical failings aside, Dickson at least used to be able to
keep a story moving -- this one sadly, takes teeth-gritting effort
to plow through.</p>

<p><cite>Wolf And Iron</cite> gets April's Golden Turkey award for
Conspicuous Waste of Paper by A Major Talent. Once, long ago, in
the days of <cite>The Genetic General</cite> and
<cite>Neuromancer</cite> and <cite>The Tactics Of Mistake</cite> I
really liked Dickson's work. I wish I could say I still did.</p>
