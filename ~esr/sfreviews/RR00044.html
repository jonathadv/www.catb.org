<pre>
%T The Berserker Wars
%A Fred Saberhagen
%I TOR Books
%D Dec 1981
%O paperback, US$3.95
%P 399
%G 0-812-50101-2
</pre>

<p>Yet another reissue of one of SF's hardy perennials, the
collected best short stories from Fred Saberhagen's `Berserker'
universe. If you haven't read his classic tales of the war between
human and destroyer-machine, by all means snarf a copy of this
collection. It's well worth keeping.</p>

<pre>
%T Cathouse
%A Dean Ing
%I Baen Books
%D May 1990
%O paperback, US$3.95
%P 247
%G 0-671-69872-9
</pre>

<p>This book continues Baen's annoying prediliction for repackaging
stuff he's already bought once under a new cover. At least this
particular new wineskin is honestly labelled; the material was
originally published in parts in the <cite>Man-Kzin Wars</cite>
shared-universe anthologies. And the stories themselves are pretty
good; Ing puts a deal of knowledge of animal ethology to work in
painting a more interesting and convincing portrait of the Kzin
than Niven himself ever has. So maybe this one's worth buying
anyhow.</p>

<pre>
%S Demon Crown
%T Symphony of Storms
%V 3
%A Robert E. Vardeman
%I TOR Books
%D May 1990
%O paperback, US$3.95
%P 280
%G 0-812-50084-9
</pre>

<p>All right, I tried, OK? I really <em>tried</em> to read this
wretched pile of heroic-fantasy genre cliches through. I couldn't.
Like the rest of Vardeman's innumerable cookie-cutter formula
pieces, this turkey is so bad it glows in the dark. Shame on TOR
for publishing it, and excuse me while I ceremonially burn it.</p>

<pre>
%T Home Is The Hangman/We, In Some Strange Power's Employ...
%A Roger Zelazny/Samuel Delany
%I TOR Books
%D May 1990
%O paperback, US$3.95
%P 96/81
%G 0-812-50983-8
</pre>

<p>This is TOR Double #21, a pair of reissues from 1975 and 1968
respectively. Both are strong early works by two of SF's best prose
stylists. Ignore Zelazny's nonsense about AI resurrecting vitalism
and you'll find the "science" of <cite>Hangman</cite> eerily
prefigures today's preoccupation with neural nets and trainable
systems. <cite>We</cite> has dated a bit more but still bears
rereading quite well.</p>

<pre>
%T The Dream Master
%A Roger Zelazny
%I TOR Books
%D May 1990
%O paperback, US$3.50
%P 196
%G 0-671-69874-5
</pre>

<p>Another early (1966) work by Zelazny that retains its relevance
quite well -- his story of Render, the dream-engineering therapist
who wanders into peril through failing to understand his
<em>own</em> dark dreams. One of the few successful attempts at
psychological SF.</p>
