<p>In <cite>Silk Roads And Shadows</cite>, Susan Shwartz gives us
the story of the princess Alexandra, sister to the Emperor of an
alternate timeline's Byzantium, who journeys into the East to steal
silkworms needed to revive the Byzantine silk industry and finds
there far more than she bargains for. From the beginning her
journey is haunted by the sendings of her aunt Theodora, the
sorceress who blighted Byzantium's silkworms and covets its crown.
Alexandra is saved at first by an encounter with the mysterious
King of the mystic city of Shamballah. He warns her that her only
chance of survival is to tread the perilous Diamond Path, to learn
the Vajrayana magical discipline of esoteric Buddhism. Her journey
becomes a spiritual oddyssey as well as a geographical one, a
series of testing which can end only when she meets death or
transcends it.</p>

<p>The prose styling is good; the research that went into the
world-building was obviously both wide-ranging and thorough (I
particularly appreciated the sensitivity with which Shwartz
approaches the Vajrayana and syncretizes the half-a-dozen religious
traditions known to her characters into a coherent whole around
it). The adventures Alexandra and her friends endure have all the
splendor and terror and magical brilliance of the Arabian Nights
tales; on that level, the book is a lot of fun.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, its appeal for me was nearly ruined by a major
flaw common in the subgenre -- the attitudes and very personalities
of the major characters were ludicrously anachronistic for the
historical context. In this respect and a few others the book
uncomfortably approaches the "MZB-wannabee" syndrome I discussed in
<a href="RR00034.html">RR#34</a>.</p>

<p>As in much genre SF and fantasy, the protagonist is a strong
individual set against her culture's values, and the plot depends
largely on how effectively she can get free of them to do "what is
right" in a wider sense. The problem with this is that the kind of
individuality that could even conceive of its ethical problems in
that way is a modern Western invention; tolerance of non-conformity
even in one's own thoughts is, historically, a <em>very</em>
exceptional trait.</p>

<p>In SF, which is set in the future, this is not (usually) a
problem. In whole-cloth secondary worlds like Tolkien's, one can
simply handwave the question. But Alexandra's psychological
modernity is so out of place in a 9th-century Byzantine as to jar
one's teeth. The `real' Alexandra (if the actual doings and
writings of pre-moderns are any guide) would have been far more
parochial and culture-bound, like the novel's Prince Li Shou who
(though he is genuinely xenophilic) is ultimately doomed by his
inability to break his own conditioning. Nor it is it only
Alexandra who acts like an anachronism. Haraldr, her faithful
guardsman, displays none of the grim fatalism attested by the Norse
sagas or the historical lives of its heroes; he is too autonomous,
too willing to conceive of life as a struggle with fate that the
human individual might actually win.</p>

<p>Admittedly, it's hard for a 20th-century author to get inside
such a mindset. And in fiction that aims to be simple escapism
perhaps one shouldn't demand it. But it's precisely
<em>because</em> Shwartz otherwise displays such talent and
craftsmanship that the problem stands out. If she continues to do
historical fantasy, I hope she will put more effort into making her
characters psychologically plausible in context.</p>
