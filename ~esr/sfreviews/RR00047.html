<p>Gwynne Heikki is a salvager, partner in a free-lance company
that takes on rescue-and-reclamation jobs for the interstellar
megacorps. Professional pride overrides her caution to make her
take a contract with the Lo-Moth corporation that looks good to be
true -- and it is. On the face of it the job should be simple; find
a cargo zeppelin crashed in the jungle country of the backwater
planet Iadara, discover why it went down, and retrieve whatever
possible from the wreck. Despite Iadara's freak storms, the
man-killing heat and the carnivorous native hominids, the job
should be doable. But someone doesn't want her to succeed -- and is
willing to kill to stop her. The wreck, it seems, holds a secret
that could shatter the human galaxy...</p>

<p>In the "Silence Leigh" trilogy (<cite>Five Twelfths of
Heaven</cite>, <cite>Silence In Solitude</cite>, and <cite>Empress
Of Earth</cite>), <cite>The Game Of Empire</cite>, and <cite>The
Kindly Ones</cite>, Melissa Scott demonstrated a skilled hand at
creating exotic societies with amazing depth and texture, layering
on sociological detail with the exquisite precision of a hard-SF
writer constructing a scientific McGuffin. All these books were
also crackling good adventure-and-intrigue reads.</p>

<p>In <cite>Mighty Good Road</cite>, the world-building skill is
still there but, sadly, a lot of the narrative drive of the earlier
novels is absent. Scott's characters seem to spend entirely too
much time in some sort of transit vehicle or other; the plot drags,
and neither the physical nor the psychological action ultimately
seems to mean all that much even to the main characters.</p>

<p>Since Melissa Scott is such a damned fine scenarist, it's some
fun just to watch the wheels turn -- but, well, the way the action
is resolved (by a character introduced very late who just sort of
waltzes in and blows away all the remaining obstructions) makes one
suspect that she got as tired as the plot and just sort of tied it
off.</p>

<p>This is not <em>quite</em> Golden Turkey material -- there are
too many neat and original touches in the scenery (the depiction of
the commercial society built up around the wormhole "railroads" is
nifty). But this Melissa Scott fan hopes she can do better next
time.</p>
