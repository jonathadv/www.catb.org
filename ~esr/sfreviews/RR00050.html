<h1 class="c1">Raymond's Reviews #50</h1>

<p>Today, a bouquet of four bombs for your reading
displeasure...</p>

<pre>
%T The Steps of the Sun
%A Walter Tevis
%I Collier Nucleus
%D May 1990
%O paperback, US$4.50
%P 251
%G 0-02-029865-X
</pre>

<p>Everybody's entitled to an off day sometimes, and by me this is
the Collier Nucleus series's first failure of taste. Tevis manages
to combine some of the worst cliches of space opera (the
millionaire inventor who builds his own spaceship to go off and
Save The World) with the most tiresome attributes of the mainstream
"novel of character" (the protagonist's boringly predictable
neuroses are the real subject of the text). This is literatus
disease (see <a href="RR00036.html">RR#36</a>) on the hoof, not
saved by Tevis's undoubted skill at prose construction and the few
brief moments in which the world convinces.</p>

<pre>
%T Space Hawks
%A Sean Dalton
%I Berkeley/Ace
%D May 1989
%O paperback, US$3.50
%P 188
%G 0-441-77732-5
</pre>

<p>Bletch. This is the first book in a formulaic space-opera series
of the most mindless sort, one that promises to be fully as
wretched as DAW's "Cap Kennedy" books. I found it utterly
unreadable, and suggest that it belongs at the bottom of the same
toxic waste dump as Vardeman's <cite>Demon Crown</cite> books (see
<a href="RR00044.html">RR#44</a>).</p>

<pre>
%T The Ransom of Black Stealth One
%A Dean Ing
%I TOR Books
%D April 1990
%O paperback, US$5.95
%P 471
%G 0-812-50857-2
</pre>

<p>Dean Ing has written some decent SF in the past. Sadly, in this
venture into techno-thrillerdom the gadgets are the only things
that work. This book is an old man's fantasy of regained youth
(courtesy of an idealized Bright Young Thing the protagonist
kidnaps who spends the rest of the novel throwing herself at him).
It comes with a disturbing subtext of amorality and callousness and
entirely too many `good guys' who betray and kill on orders or for
a mean revenge...and too many bad guys right out of Central Casting
for old-fashioned Russian heavies. The only good parts are the
aerial chase scenes. If you must read those, wait till you can find
this one used.</p>

<pre>
%T Spellbound
%A Ru Emerson
%I Ace Books
%D May 1990
%O paperback, US$5.95
%P 471
%G 0-441-77792-9
</pre>

<p>Sigh. Yet <em>another</em> wretched formula fantasy-romance for
the teen market, replete with the usual glossy-carboard characters,
melodramatic plot, and overwrought prose (there's even, can you
believe it, an evil stepmother!). There's not a shred of
originality or idea content anywhere to be found in this mess, nor
much of anything else for that matter, but the way it's packaged
and aimed just about guarantee that it'll move off the shelves
anyhow. Oh, well, let's hope the sales from it will subsidize
something more interesting.</p>
