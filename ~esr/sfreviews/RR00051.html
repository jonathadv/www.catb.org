<p>Alan Dean Foster is well-known as the author of the Flinx series
(<cite>The Tar Aiym-Krang</cite> and many sequels) and other novels
set in his Humanx Commonwealth universe (most notably the Skua
September books; <cite>Iceworld</cite>, <cite>Mission To
Moloukin</cite>, and <cite>The Deluge Drivers</cite>). He has also
written innumerable movie and TV novelizations of which the
best-known is probably <cite>Aliens</cite>. His books, even at
their best, tend to be like the old canard about Chinese food;
they're fun, but you want to read something else an hour later.
This one is thinner than most.</p>

<p>Vernon Moody, a gentle-minded Good Ole Boy happily toiling in
obscurity as a detective in Tampa's police department, is assigned
to a baffling murder case. He must discover who broke into the home
of a wealthy local businessman and murdered him in a way that
leaves forensic experts puzzled...apparently just to destroy a
Navaho sand painting.</p>

<p>The case takes him to the Navaho reservation in Arizona, and
partners him with a bright Navaho cop, Ooljee, who knows enough
stray bits about his people's traditions to be very uneasy about
the murder. Now, here comes the McGuffin (and no, this is not a
major spoiler): the sand painting turns out to contain a fractal
which encodes the granddaddy of all computer viruses -- one which
straightaway begins infecting human computers and causing all
manner of weird manifestations.</p>

<p>Well, this premise has holes you could throw a starship through.
Firstly, fractals don't encode a lot of information -- in fact, in
a rather deep sense, the apparent disjunction between their
structural complexity and informational simplicity is what makes
them interesting. And the issues in how an alien program expressed
in goddess-knows-what bizarre language and encoding scheme is
supposed to be able to infect a random human computer is just
ignored.</p>

<p>Once you get past this crock, the rest of the plot is fairly
elementary crank-turning as Moody and his agent of explanation
chase the murderer and confront various nasties out of Navaho
legend. All this seems to function mainly as a frame for Ooljee to
lecture Moody and the reader about various (admittedly interesting)
bits of lore. Obviously, Foster <em>really</em> really wanted to
write a book with a bunch of Navaho stuff in it.</p>

<p>As usual, Foster's prose tends to pull one along even where the
material gets paper-thin. Thank you, though, I'll take my
anthropology straight. While I wouldn't claim <cite>Cyber
Way</cite> exudes the malignant badness of some of the stuff I've
had to review lately, it's no better than poor-grade yard goods.
Yet another Flinx novel might have yielded little more substance,
but would have been more fun.</p>
