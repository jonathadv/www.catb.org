<p>Once again this month Del Rey's classiest act is by Harry
Turtledove, author of <cite>Noninterference</cite>, <cite>The
Videssos Cycle</cite> and last month's excellent anthology
<cite>Kaleidoscope</cite> (see <a href="RR00031.html">RR#31</a>).
In <cite>A World Of Difference</cite>, Turtledove gives us a tense
novel of first contact, intrigue, and action that could stand
comparison with vintage Poul Anderson.</p>

<p>It is sometime in the late 1980s, and a joint U.S./Soviet
expedition is about to land on the planet Minerva. Minerva, very
similar to Earth in size and chemical composition but (as one would
expect) somewhat colder, is the fourth planet of Sol...yes, you
read that correctly. This is not our timeline. On Harry's Earth,
Mikhail Gorbachev lasted less than a year before dying of a
suspicious "hemhorrage"...quite possibly a steel-jacketed one.
Nevertheless the great powers have managed to patch together some
sort of detente. As token of this, they send a pair of ships timed
to land together and (at least nominally) cooperate with each
other. For reasons which may or may not involve a try for
one-upmanship by NASA, the ships end up on opposite sides of one of
the huge gorges that divide the Minervan surface -- and both
immediately make contact with Minerva's native intelligent
life.</p>

<p>The Minervans are intelligent hexapods who forge tools and
weapons from ice. They're primitive but not stupid -- and the
groups the humans land among are headed inexorably towards war. The
two groups of humans find it hard to avoid taking sides.</p>

<p>Indeed, the humans by and large want to prevent any violence (if
only because it wouldn't play well with the folks back home). But
when the Minervan aggressors are led into battle by a
Kalashnikov-toting KGB operative out to spread the glorious
Socialist revolution to a whole new planet, their challenge becomes
simpler; to stay alive -- and to prevent the suddenly-explosive
confrontation on Minerva from triggering World War III on
Earth.</p>

<p>I'd say this is Turtledove's best novel-length work yet. While
Turtledove doesn't duck the Cold War implications of his theme, he
never dehumanizes the "villains" of the piece either -- even the
KGB man's internal life makes sense on its own terms. Things get
out of hand as much by mistake as by malice, and not all the
mistakes are on the Russian side.</p>

<p>The aliens are also interestingly drawn; there's some convincing
portrayal of how a being with a radially-symmetrical sensorium and
antifreeze in its blood would be amazed by humans, and a neat
subplot woven around a tragedy inherent in Minervan reproductive
biology. If, aside from that, they seem quite human -- well, their
ecological niche is a lot like homo sap's and economics is
economics everywhere. It's made clear that the author did his
homework.</p>

<p>All in all this one is definitely worth a read. Pick it up if
only to watch how Turtledove is growing. I wonder what he'll come
out with next month? :-)</p>
