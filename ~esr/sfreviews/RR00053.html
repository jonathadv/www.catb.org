<p>In 1986's <cite>Hardwired</cite>, Walter Jon Williams gave us
possibly the best cyberpunk novel barring William Gibson's own work
and Bruce Sterling's <cite>Schismatrix</cite>. 1987's <cite>Voice
Of The Whirlwind</cite>, though not quite as brilliant, stood
head-and-shoulders above most of the rest of the subgenre.
<cite>Angel Station</cite> is Williams's third major cyberpunk
novel -- and a winner it is, too.</p>

<p>Ubu Roy and Beautiful Maria are the gene-spun children of Pasco,
`bossrider' (captain) of the interstellar tramp freighter
<cite>Runaway</cite> -- artificially gestated, growth-accelerated,
somatically altered for high intelligence and special abilities
useful to starship `shooters'. Pasco is a brilliant loser who sees
his world and the shooter culture he loves dying under the impact
of Consolidation, political pressure from the Multi-Polities at the
center of human space to stabilize the wild Fringes.</p>

<p>As the novel opens, Ubu and Beautiful Maria are watching Pasco's
last video-note to them, made just before he committed suicide.
They don't have time to mourn him; <cite>Runaway's</cite> debts are
piling up, a rival shooter clan is on their tail, and Consolidation
looms over all like a falling planet. They are driven to use
Beautiful Maria's talent for witching computer systems to defraud,
but they're amateurs at it -- they foul up and escape Angel Station
barely ahead of the law.</p>

<p>Their only hope is to find a singularity usable as a starship's
heart, wealth so fabulous they can buy out of their troubles. What
they find instead is First Contact...</p>

<p>Williams's portrait of the high-flash-and-low-dives world of the
shooters is fun stuff, and the aliens of Clan Lustre are serious
weird (one of the better and biologically more plausible variations
on the communal-entity theme I've seen). At bottom, though, this is
a novel about how Ubu and Beautiful Maria grow up, and it works
because Williams gets you to identify with the process despite the
extremely odd context of their lives (as pictured, they're not that
much less alien than the aliens). This is no juvenile, though --
shooters party hard and one of the things Ubu and Maria were
engineered for is each other.</p>

<p>If there's a flaw in this novel, it's that the ending seems too
pat, all the solutions tied together into a bundle that's a bit too
neat. That's always a risk in genre fiction, but Williams is a good
enough writer that he ought to be able to manage a resolution
that's more complex and grey-scaled but still satisfying.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the ride to get there is memorable. This book has
lots of wonderful descriptive bits in it; Maria shooting a black
hole, Ubu playing the polyphonic shooter analogue of rock music in
an Angel Station bar, the interior of Clan Lustre's world-ship.
There's a priceless couple of paragraphs on an alien's reaction to
a human spy drama. Even the minor characters live and move.</p>

<p>All in all, I think this is one of the best novels I've read
this year, and wouldn't be much surprised if it gets nominated for
a Hugo (though I doubt it would win). I give it an official
Raymond's Reviews Black-Leather-and-Chrome-Hyperkinetic-Ambience
Award and recommend it strongly.</p>
