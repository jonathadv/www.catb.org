<p>In <cite>Madouc</cite>, Jack Vance continues (and perhaps
concludes) the fantasy epic he began with <cite>Lyonesse</cite> and
continued with <cite>The Green Pearl</cite> -- and a most
delightful and marvellous job he does of it, too.</p>

<p>The setting is the Elder Isles; north of Iberia, south of
Cornwall, west of Acquitaine -- a realm time-deep in history and
magic, the green setting for the jewel-city of Ys and Avallon and
Lyonesse, and other towns and castles and citadels and habitations
great and small. Mossy dolmens brood in the wild places; here and
there puissant magicians dwell, commanding the service of imps and
sandestins and simulacra and creatures yet more bizarre. The tombs
and traces of Pelasgians and Evadnioi, of Goth and Celt, of Romans
and Lydians and Phoenicians and Daanans; all can be seen in the
Isles and its people. Still on their bleak Foreshore the grim Ska
dream apart over their three-thousand-year lineages; still the
fairies of Thripsey Shee dance their roundels beneath the silver
moon. And in farm, cottage, and castle most humans know nothing of
these matters, nor care.</p>

<p>In <cite>Lyonesse</cite>, Vance has given us the story of the
Isle's troubles after the death of Olam III, the last High King.
War and intrigue and the ambitions of princes split the Isles into
eleven fractious kingdoms. When Casmir, the ruthless King of
Lyonesse, sought to unite them, he found his chiefest opposition in
the islands of Troicinet and Dascinet. Their prince, the young and
gallant Aillas, became involved with Casmir's daughter Suldrun
while incognito, she bore him a child. The manner of Suldrun's
death caused Aillas to swear a terrible vengeance against
Casmir.</p>

<p>In <cite>The Green Pearl</cite>, the focus shifted to the
magicians; to the duels of sorcery and intrigue which followed the
witch Desmei's infection with the evil green essence of Xalbiste,
and of the fates which befel those who defied the arch-wizard
Murgen's edict not to enlist themselves in the wars of mortals.</p>

<p>In <cite>Madouc</cite>, we join the tale of the Princess Madouc,
shown to the world as Suldrun's daughter but in fact a changeling
substituted by the fairies of Thrpsey Shee. Casmir knows that
Suldrun in fact had a son, and seeks his life; for the magic mirror
Persilian prophesied that if that sun were to sit on the throne
Evandig and take his place at the Table of Heroes, he and not
Casmir would rule over Lyonesse. And indeed Suldrun's son Dhrun is
alive and has rejoined his father, but Casmir does not know his
identity. Casmir's priest, the scheming Father Umphred,
<em>does</em> know...but he has his own goals.</p>

<p>Jack Vance has long been one of SF's finest prose stylists. For
decades his rich and quirky descriptive style and his mordant,
droll, ironic prose have been widely praised and occasionally
imitated. In <cite>Madouc</cite> he is at the very top of his form,
producing results of a quality very few contemporary fantasists
could equal and none could unequivocally surpass.</p>

<p>Vance fans will find all the wit they expect, and newcomers to
his work should be captivated by this fine expression of his unique
talent. <cite>Madouc</cite> will certainly be one of the two or
three best fantasy releases of 1990, and I recommend it
enthusiastically.</p>
