<p>Jack Womack's <cite>Terraplane</cite> is a dense, paranoid, grim
cyberpunk novel with a twist -- most of the action takes place in
1939.</p>

<p>The viewpoint characters are two ex-military types involved in
industrial espionage against Krasnaya, the giant industrial combine
that owns a future Soviet Union. Luther is the brains of the team;
Jake his super-competent, emotionless hatchetman. They are sent to
extract a scientist named Octobriana, but betrayed; the three
capture their betrayer Skuratov but are forced to fly back in time,
landing in the New York City of an alternate history's 1939.</p>

<p>Luther is black and Octobriana an obvious foreigner -- and they
quickly discover that this makes the mean streets of New York in
1939 a far more dangerous place for them than their home time. And
then there are the odd divergences -- in <em>this</em> world,
Lincoln was assassinated early and Teddy Roosevelt freed the
slaves. An influenza-like plague called DS, far deadlier than AIDS,
has killed millions. Technological progress has run differently,
perhaps faster than in the history Luther knew.</p>

<p>Caught out of time, Luther and Jake find all their
sophistication has become a dangerous naivete -- and Octobriana has
caught DS. They must get home to their high-tech future if any of
the three is to survive -- but their only ticket out is Skuratov,
who had hold of the time-projection device when he was ejected from
their plane. And somehow, he seems to have recruited powerful local
help...</p>

<p>The action in the first part of the novel alternately drags and
lurches; Womack doesn't really seem to hit his authorial stride
until the viewpoint characters land in 1939. Once we're there the
characters' attempts to cope become darkly amusing, a caution to
anyone who still believes the past was a simpler and more `human'
time.</p>

<p>I can't say that I think the novel is entirely a success. Luther
and Jake's weird argot seems to me contrived, and their future not
really a believable extrapolation of our own; only the negatives
are familiar. And the idea of a time machine implemented as a
<em>video cassette</em>! In general the logical justification for
the plot is kind of weak; Womack seems to be more interested in
symbolism and mordantly `artistic' social criticism -- a touch of
literatus disease, there. But overall I applaud what Womack was
trying to do; it's audacious and tough-minded and displays
considerable talent and originality.</p>

<p>On the evidence of <cite>Terraplane</cite>, I'm going to look
out for a used copy of Womack's first novel, <cite>Ambient</cite>,
and look forward to his third one. It should be interesting to see
what direction he grows in.</p>
