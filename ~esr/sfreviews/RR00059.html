<p>The novel <cite>The Forever War</cite> won Joe Haldeman a rep as
one of the best and gutsiest new writers in SF. Subsequent work
including the novels <cite>Mindbridge</cite>, <cite>Tool of The
Trade</cite>, <cite>All My Sins Remembered</cite>, and the
brilliant anthology <cite>Infinite Dreams</cite> confirmed his
reputation as a first-class prose craftsman unafraid to stretch the
limits of the SF genre from inside.</p>

<p>In <cite>Buying Time</cite> Haldeman gives us the story of
Dallas Barr, one of the elite group of `Stilemans' who earn
rejuvenation every ten years at the cost of all their worldly
goods. As the novel begins he is one hundred and thirty-six years
old but still young in mind, an adventurer who routinely takes
hair-raising physical risks for fun and disdains the paranoid
caution and conservatism of other Stilemans.</p>

<p>When approached by a conspiracy of Stilemans who aim to break
the Stileman Clinic's rules against accumulation of wealth and take
covert control of the Solar System, he is repelled and rejects the
offer. Shortly thereafter he and his Stileman lover Maria are
attacked and his best friend Eric Lundley is brutally murdered. The
hunt is up; He and Maria and the downloaded `Turing Image' of
Eric's mind must somehow escape and expose the assassins of the
shadowy `Steering Committee'. And the Committee-controlled media of
the System have framed him for his friend's death and painted him
as a homicidal psychotic to be shot on sight...</p>

<p>This is of course a fairly conventional running-man plot; it's
the characters and scenery that make this novel special, giving it
a texture of surprise and suspense and dark humor and authenticity
many writers would kill to match. The sequences in the Conch
Republic and the asteroid cities of Novysibirsk are particularly
well done, depicting cheerful if violent anarcho-capitalist
societies that might remind one of L. Neil Smith's books (except
that there's no polemic here and the writing is much better). They
cause me to suspect that Haldeman's politics might be taking a
somewhat libertarian turn lately (I wouldn't mind living in Conch
or Novysibirsk myself).</p>

<p>Haldeman's gift for the telling detail and humorous throwaway
line is in evidence here (this is the same man who wrote <cite>A
!Tangled Web</cite>, the story that added "All die! Oh, the
embarrassment..." to the SF fan's phraseology). The cross-eyes in
Big Dick Goodwin's signature (p. 163) and the menu list on the
window of the Novosibirsk brothel ("Liability release required,
pervert!") are worth the price of the book by themselves, in
context.</p>

<p>This book doesn't quite meet the ground-breaking, Hugo-quality
standard of Haldeman's earlier work -- but then, I don't think it
was meant to. I think Haldeman was basically having fun when he
wrote this one -- and I think you'll have fun reading it. One
Raymond's Reviews Black Flag award for Every-Which-Way-But-Loose
Anarchobackground, and my respect to the author for having enough
<em>other</em> good ideas not to obsess on it. Enjoy!</p>
