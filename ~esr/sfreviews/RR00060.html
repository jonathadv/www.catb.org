<p>The world has too many SF writers in it who want to be "serious
authors", respected for all the most tiresome reasons by the
pompous nits who dominate "serious literature". It also has too
many editors who believe that SF could be improved by substituting
oodles of characterological nuance, symbolism, and "style" for its
traditional strengths of engaging storytelling, sense-of-wonder and
intellectual stimulation. Put enough people with these delusions
together and you get an anthology like <cite>Full Spectrum
2</cite>.</p>

<p>Its first story, a pointless bit of atmospherics about a
derelict who builds a dinosaur out of chicken-wire and compost,
announces loud and clear that we are going for Significance here,
and that anyone expecting entertainment or idea content had best
prepare to be disappointed. And, indeed, most of the rest of the
stories bear a strong family resemblance to it -- short, lushly
written, and themed on loss, futility, enigma, failure and (often)
a pervasive anti-rationalism.</p>

<p>Do I sound hostile to these goings-on? You bet I am. I've
already lived through one episode of galloping literatus plague in
SF, back when the "New Wave" was big. Those people devalued what
made SF special and wonderful and enduring and wanted to make it
over into a tired copy of academic and "avant-garde" literature.
Most of the collaborators on <cite>Full Spectrum 2</cite> seem to
have been at least temporarily possessed by a similar wretched
messianism.</p>

<p>It's significant to me although this anthology bills itself as a
report from the frontiers of "speculative" fiction, innovations in
content are damn thin on the ground here; <em>stylistic</em>
experiment and ornamentation is king. And that (judging by the lack
of any publishing history, and the contributors' notes) all these
stories are original for the anthology -- none of them have stood a
market test in the magazines. These are not stories written for
fans, they're written for other writers and editors.</p>

<p>And yes, the micro-level writing is general excellent. But
anthologies like this one promote the misconception that fine prose
and conventional 20th-century litcrit virtue is <em>enough</em> to
make good SF/fantasy, when in fact it's not and can even be
antagonistic to SF's better qualities. Style is a good thing, but
not when it drives out content -- and in this anthology it often
does. That's not what I call a good model for SF.</p>

<p>A few good SF/fantasy stories escape from this ruck; Elizabeth
Hand's <cite>The Boy In The Tree</cite>, David Ira McCleary's
<cite>All My Sins Forgotten</cite>, David Brin's <cite>The Giving
Plague</cite>, Stephen Spruill's <cite>Silver</cite>, Steven
Popkes's <cite>Rain, Steam and Speed</cite>, James Kilius's
<cite>Shiva</cite>, Alan Rodgers's <cite>Frankenstein Goes
Home</cite>, Michael Swanwick's <cite>The Edge of The World</cite>;
most of the rest of the 27 are failures, or merely good writing
with little or no SF or fantasy content, or (and this is subtler)
minimal content that merely limns a story any mainstreamer could
have framed equally vividly (perhaps better) without the genre
props. I think SF ought to hew to higher (and, yes, more exclusive)
standards.</p>

<p>I'll leave this anthology with the second Too-Precious-To-Live
Award for Higher Literary Persiflage by People Smart Enough To Know
Better. And now, if you'll excuse me, I think I feel a sudden
craving for a hit of "Doc" Smith's Old Original Space Opera Trash
coming on -- just what I need to sear the cloying perfume of
<cite>Full Spectrum 2</cite> out of my nostrils.</p>
