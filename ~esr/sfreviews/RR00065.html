<p>One of the traps that lies in wait for talented young writers is
the canard that they ought to be putting their gift to Higher
Purposes than Mere Entertainment. A great deal of self-important
garbage gets churned out by victims of this delusion who haven't
yet learned that a novel that doesn't entertain is like a baby
trying to fly before he can walk; the result is at best a tantrum
and at worst a fatal fall.</p>

<p>Sad to say, Kim Stanley Robinson had this bug for a while. I
thought <cite>Icehenge</cite> was a self-indulgent, rambling,
pointless pile of junk; and <cite>The Wild Shore</cite>'s spindly
narrative frame nearly collapsed under the load of Message,
Significance, and risible Political Correctness it was made to
carry (Nebula juries seem to be unreasonably impressed by that sort
of thing, which probably explains why they run a poor second in
prestige to the Hugo). After those two failures I wrote off
Robinson as just another Bright Young Thing ruined by the artiste
syndrome.</p>

<p>Happily, this collection of four dead-on-target comic novellas
(parts first published in IASFM) suggests that Kim Stanley Robinson
has recovered, and attained enough maturity not to take himself too
seriously. His reward, of course, is that he emerges as a better
writer than almost any of those who do. And in the process, he
retails his messages with a grace and subtlety that could teach the
Ellisons and Disches and Vonneguts of the world a few things, and
puts all their sad sophomoric little wannabees utterly to
shame.</p>

<p>The viewpont character, George Fergusson, is a mountain guide
based in Kathmandu. The first part opens with his accidental
discovery that another mountain guide, Nathan Howe, has made
friends with a real live honest-to-goodness yeti. When Howe returns
to the city with his friend "Freds" Fredericks, George agrees to a
scheme to liberate Nathan's furry friend from a millionaire trophy
hunter who's had the yeti locked up in a hotel bathroom as he
schemes how to cover himself in glory by announcing the creature's
existence to the world.</p>

<p>Well -- they spring him, but what are they going to do with him?
Robinson's yeti is the perfect noble savage, a hairy hominid Buddha
of perfect serenity unequipped for survival among humans by
anything but a keen sense for who his friends are. They name him
"Buddha", in fact, and decide to take him back to his home
wilderness.</p>

<p>He makes cameos in parts two, three and four, though, which
feature even wackier events like an illegal Everest climb to bury a
body and a faked border incident involving demon-masks and mortar
rounds of solid turquoise that nearly starts World War III. And
there's not a cheap laugh in the book, either; all of them come
with that odd flash of recognition you get upon being shown the
world from a new angle.</p>

<p>Now, if you've already suspected that Buddha and his Tibetan
friends are something of a foil for authorial ruminations on the
perversity of human nature and the value of gentleness towards our
planet and fellow beings, you're right. Thankfully Robinson has
grown wise enough to be witty rather than scathing, and to make the
book so much fun that you won't mind the medicine even though you
can smell it coming. Would that all writers had learned as much
confidence, subtlety and craft.</p>
