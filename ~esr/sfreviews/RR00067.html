<p>David Brin's new novel, <cite>Earth</cite>, is a triumph. Brin
has done it again. I predict that if he doesn't win the '90 novel
Hugo it'll be because the committee figures three inside of a
decade's span is a bit much.</p>

<p>This novel is SF in the great tradition. It has exotic
speculative physics, suspenseful plot, breathtaking (and coherent)
speculations on the nature of consciousness, characters you can
believe, a richly worked out future with a weird but plausible
history and new ethical dilemmas of its own. Cosmic scope and
human-scale action. Love, tears, psychological insight, madness,
death, life and apotheosis. An ethical core of passionate but
clear-sighted concern for the fate of our planetary ecosphere. And
even an <cite>Illuminatus!</cite> reference! :-)</p>

<p>I'm not going to try to summarize the plot here. There's too
much to fit in, nor could I properly convey the way the book
gathers momentum as one reads to convey what seems like an
exponential explosion of intellectual challenge and action. Also,
the viewpoint shifts between several major characters with very
different personalities who draw differing meanings from them, so
attempting to summarize what happens would require a bio or
three.</p>

<p>Perhaps as wonderful as the book's ostensive plot is the
numerous other ways it celebrates the rich history of Earth's
biosphere, our possible futures, the resourcefulness of the human
animal, and even the very genre tradition within which it is
written (a number of conscious allusions are acknowledged in an
afterword). Brin has woven several of the most traditional motifs
of SF with the most advanced thinking in physics and biology and AI
and several remarkable speculations of his own. Lesser authors
would have worked an entire (but thinner) novel out of just his
portrait of the future of computer networks alone.</p>

<p>So don't wait for the paperback; pay the twenty bucks. This is
probably the best SF novel you will read this year.</p>
