<p>[Contributed by guest reviewer Cathy Olanich -- ESR]</p>

<p>Fantasies are stories about believable people whose troubles
result from situations only possible in universes where magic and
sorcery have direct, physical effects. Fairy tales, on the other
hand, also involve magic, but rarely involve "characters" in the
novelistic sense. The central character in a fairy tale is an
everyperson character with a particular kind of emotional conflict
to resolve, and the sidekicks or villains are aspects of that
character's own subconscious mind.</p>

<p>Louise Cooper's series INDIGO, of which Nocturne is the fourth
book, accomplishes the noteworthy task of melding fairy tale with
fantasy in a manner that does not compromise the strengths of
either genre. The protagonist, like Pandora of the Greek myths, has
released demons upon the world. Unlike Pandora, however, she had
ample warning that her action in doing so was rash, and unlike
Pandora she is held responsible for what she has done; she cannot
die until she has slain the seven demons she has released. She
assumes the name Indigo (the color of mourning, among her people)
and, armed with the talisman of the Earth Mother to assist her,
commences her quest.</p>

<p>What distinguishes Indigo's quest from hundreds of other fantasy
epic quests is Cooper's unrelenting emphasis on the fact that
Indigo is both her own most stalwart ally and her own worst enemy.
An eighth demon, named Nemesis, who is somehow part of Indigo,
continually strives to misdirect and subvert her efforts by
appealing to her weaknesses: sentimentality, lack of self-control,
fear, despair. Yet with the aid of her steadfast companion, a
telepathic wolf named Grimya, and other people she meets and
befriends on her journey, she succeeds in mustering the abilities
required to dispatch the demons she confronts.</p>

<p>Nocturne is an excellent example of the style of Cooper's series
and illustrates its strengths and weaknesses well. Here, Indigo is
traveling with a red-haired family of itinerant musicians and
actors when she arrives at a town whose pale, drained, inhabitants
are being drawn into a thorny, barren wood where nature's laws do
not hold. After a number of false starts, she destroys the demon
responsible by refusing to believe in his vision of doom and by
throwing all her energy into imposing her own vision of health and
order on his domain.</p>

<p>If Cooper's grand scheme has a flaw, it is that the INDIGO books
move rather slowly to their conclusions, partly due to her zeal to
exploit the psychological and archetypal resonances of Indigo's
situation to their limits, and partly because the narrative
structure that she has erected demands that Indigo kill no more
than one demon per book. If you like fantasy to move with lightning
speed, or value originality and surprise in world construction
above stories that attempt to plumb "the depths of the human heart"
[in other words, if you're a hardcore SF fan like me :-) -- ESR],
pass these books by. But if you are looking for an author who is
unafraid to navigate in deeper psychological waters, give these
books a try. You may be surprised at how long they will haunt
you.</p>

<p>[My take is more like: Aargh! Yet another telepathic-wolf story!
