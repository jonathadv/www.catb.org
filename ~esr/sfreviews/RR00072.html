<p>This novel brings together a number of novella and
novelette-length pieces previously published in
<cite>Analog</cite>. It's to Flynn's credit that the seams in the
book version don't show much even if you know where to look, but
I'm still disturbed by the trend it exemplifies. I'd rather see
more magazine stories standing on their own, rather than created as
carefully-parcelled-out teasers for the next book.</p>

<p>Such quibbles aside, though, the novel is OK. Flynn brings some
new energy to the psychohistory motif by supposing that secret
societies of `cliologists' (Clio was the muse of history) have been
manipulating world events since the mid-19th century. This idea of
predictive statistical sociology is not really any more plausible
than it was in Asimov's original or Gordon Dickson's recent bomb
<cite>Wolf And Iron</cite> (see <a href="RR00042.html">RR#42</a>),
but it's made to seem so by Flynn's canny use of terminology from
chaos theory and even a well-chosen equation or two.</p>

<p>Our viewpoint character is Denver real-estate developer Sarah
Beaumont. An oddly mixed list of historical events she finds in the
wall of a building she's inspecting stimulates her to curiosity
about one Brady Quinn, a shadowy statistician murdered on a Denver
street long before she was born. She discovers that Quinn was one
victim of warfare between rival secret societies of cliologists --
and that her inquisitiveness has put own life is in danger.</p>

<p>She is taken in by one group which uses the innocuous name
`Utopian Research Associates'. The Associates regard themselves as
the true inheritors of the Babbage Society, the original
cliological group formed in the early 1800s. They exist primarily
to protect the secret of cliology -- and to thwart the aims of the
degraded Babbage Society, which is attempting to program the U.S.
into a docile "managed society" of technocrats and
technopeasants.</p>

<p>Sarah wants to blow the whistle on both groups -- make the
secret of cliology irreversibly public. But that may only leave the
field to the most ruthless -- because the Associates and the
Society, as it turns out, are not the only players in the
game...</p>

<p>Flynn succeeds in raising some interesting ethical issues with
his what-if. Does a sure predictive grasp on the consequences of
human action entail a responsibility to act not shared by those who
can't see ahead? What if the necessary action is secret? And what
if it is a murder?</p>

<p>I wish those issues had been explored further. Instead, the last
third of the book is nearly pure suspense thriller -- fun stuff,
but I could get better from the Ludlums or Higginses of the world.
I'm sure something more original and with better SF values could
have been done instead.</p>

<p>That aside, Flynn is clearly a writer to watch. His work in
<cite>Analog</cite> has been of high quality (showing up in this
and last year's AnLab listings). It's a pleasure to see him
beginning to stretch into the novel form. I hope for more and
better from him in the years ahead.</p>
