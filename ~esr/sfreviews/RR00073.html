</pre>

<p>This anthology of short stories showcases the talents (and,
sadly, a few of the weaknesses) of Marc Stiegler, the author of the
excellent novel <cite>David's Sling</cite>. Many of these pieces
have appeared in <cite>Analog</cite>.</p>

<p>The centerpiece of the anthology is the title story, a
techno-optimist paean of incredible power and beauty that is
unquestionably Stiegler's finest work to date. It is immediately
followed by the nonfiction piece <cite>Hypermedia and the
Singularity</cite>, which makes a factual case for the future
described in <cite>The Gentle Seduction</cite>.</p>

<p>The other high points of this anthology are <cite>Petals Of
Rose</cite> (a story about the impact of lifespan on a sentient's
view of the Universe) and <cite>Evolution Of Entropic Error In
Closed Conservative Systems</cite> (a Probability Zero big-science
spoof). Both are well worth owning.</p>

<p>Stiegler is very much a Campbellian writer; optimistic,
evangelically rational, himself a working technologist.
Unfortunately, two other stories (<cite>Masters Of The Mortal
God</cite> and <cite>Too Loving A Touch</cite>) display
characteristic pre-Campbellian excesses; they combine melodramatic
can-he-save-the-world plots and space-opera props with rather inept
characterization and clumsy prose.</p>

<p>In fairness, these are both early works; in fact it looks from
the publishing history like <cite>Masters</cite> was an early
rejectee that Stiegler hauled out of the trunk for this anthology.
It should have stayed there. And <cite>Bully</cite> dates from
1980; the other material demonstrates that Stiegler has learned a
great deal about writing since then.</p>

<p>The remaining story, <cite>A Simple Case Of Suicide</cite>, is
competent but unexceptional. Unlike the others, it is set in a
"Club of Rome"-style future beset with galloping overpopulation and
resource depletion.</p>

<p>Overall I do recommend this anthology, most esprecially to hard
SF fans and nanotechnology enthusiasts and all interested in Vernor
Vinge's concept of "the Singularity". I'm sure Stiegler will
continue to grow as a writer, but even if he doesn't the title
story should secure him a place in the pantheon of SF's greats.</p>

<p>Rather than wishing that he give his all to become an SF
luminary on the level of Niven or Brin, though, <em>I</em> hope his
creative energy will go into making the future of <cite>The Gentle
Seduction</cite> real in the ways he describes in <cite>Hypermedia
And The Singularity</cite>. I want to live that future, not just
read about it.</p>
