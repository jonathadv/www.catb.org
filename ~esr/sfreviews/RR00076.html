<h1 class="c1">Raymond's Reviews #76</h1>

<p>I'm going to be doing <em>lots</em> of short takes for a while
to catch up with summer stuff that came out either during my August
vacation or the deadline crunch before it...</p>

<pre>
%T The Essence of Evil: Angel's Luck #3
%A Joe Clifford Faust
%I Del Rey/Ballantine
%D April 1990
%O pb
%P 281
%G 0-345-36089-3
</pre>

<p>This is vol 3 of an SF trilogy including <cite>Precious
Cargo</cite> and <cite>Desperate Measures</cite>. The books
chronicle the misadventures of a tramp-starfreighter captain with
more optimism than brains and more brains than luck. Unfortunately,
the world is unoriginal, the prose is tepid and the attempts at
humor and suspense are weak and listless. I think it's possible
that the author might grow into doing better stuff, though. Better
"luck" next time, Mr. Faust.</p>

<pre>
%T Conan the Invincible
%A Robert Jordan
%I TOR
%D July 1990
%O paperback, US$3.95
%P 284
%G 0-812-50997-8
</pre>

<p>You really can judge this book by its cover -- an inferior
knockoff of Frank Frazetta's art style, jacketing an inferior
knockoff of Robert E. Howard's wonderful deathless hack prose,
copyright 1982 by "Conan Properties", inc. Feh. That whirring noise
you hear in the background is REH's remains spinning up to around
6000rpm. Anyone with respect for his memory or a modicum of taste
should avoid this turkey like the plague.</p>

<pre>
%T Cross the Stars
%A David Drake
%I TOR
%D July 1990
%O paperback, US$3.95
%P 342
%G 0-812-50999-4
</pre>

<p>This is a reprint of one of Drake's shoot 'em, burn 'em, gas 'em
mini-epics of military carnography (from 1984), strictly for those
who love the smell of napalm in the morning. I like good military
SF myself but this olive-drab knockoff of the Odyssey ain't it --
it suffers from weak characters, implausible worldbuilding, and
constantly audible grinding noises from the primitive plot
machinery. Better you should reread Bujold or <cite>Starship
Troopers</cite>.</p>

<pre>
%T Phule's Company
%A Robert Asprin
%I Ace
%D July 1990
%O paperback, US$3.95
%P 232
%G 0-441-66251-X
</pre>

<p>This book, advertised as the first of a series, aims to spoof
military SF in much the same way the author's Skeeve books made
slapstick out of fantasy cliches. Unfortunately, the results are
less inventive. Oh, well. at least it's entertaining fluff.</p>

<p>ERRATA:</p>

<p>My review of Glen Cook's <cite>The Swordbearer</cite> in <a
href="RR00066.html">RR#66</a> should have noted that it was a
reprint of an early (1982) Cook. Thanks to Robin Bailey for
pointing this out.</p>
