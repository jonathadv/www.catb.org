<h1 class="c1">Raymond's Reviews #80</h1>

<p>More catch-up...August releases</p>

<pre>
%T Isle of the Dead
%A Roger Zelazny
%I Baen
%D August 1990
%O paperback, US$3.50
%P 201
%G 0-671-72011-2
</pre>

<p>Another classy reissue from Baen, this time of a 1969 novel by
Zelazny that hasn't dated a bit. Francis Sandow is a world designer
and one of the wealthiest humans in the galaxy. He is also, in some
sense, the god Shimbo of Darktree in the elaborate pantheon of the
alien Peian mystics. Now, a failed world-builder has forged an
alliance with Shimbo's great enemy, the dread god Belion, and the
man who has had everything must fight for his life. Zelazny fuses
psionics with theology in a way satisfying on several levels.
Enjoy.</p>

<pre>
%T Star Trek: The Lost Years
%A J. M. Dillard
%I Pocket Books
%D August 1990
%O paperback, US$4.95
%P 440
%G 0-671-70795-7
</pre>

<p>Yawn. More Star Trek formula fiction -- same old characters,
plot cut to fit a gap in the preexisting mythos, perfunctory
plotting and lots of really familiar motions signifying nothing.
Anyone who's seen <cite>Spock's World</cite> or <cite>The Wounded
Sky</cite> or even <cite>How Much For Just The Planet</cite> knows
that trekfic needn't be this boring and unoriginal. Pass on this
one.</p>

<pre>
%T Alchemy Unlimited
%A Douglas W. Clark
%I Avon
%D August 1990
%O paperback, US$4.25
%P 310
%G 0-380-75726-5
</pre>

<p>This odd first novel is actually based on a cartoon strip that
used to appear in a sewage-treatment newsletter. Yes, it's a
fantasy that's preoccupied with waste-water reprocessing; the
viewpoint character is the newly bound apprentice of the world's
only hydro-alchemist. He finds himself involved in the effort to
defeat a plague caused by toxic spillage of a demonic nature. The
weird characters he encounters include the evil Sir Hydro Phobius
(whose blazon is a dead fish), assorted tavern wenches, thugs and
dotty monks, and a homosexual dragon with a thing for hot knights.
Bizarre. But interesting.</p>

<pre>
%T Out of Sync
%A Isidore Haiblum
Publisher: Ballantine/Del Rey<br />
%O paperback, US$3.95
%P 184
%G 0-345-35501-6
</pre>

<p>At his best (as in <cite>The Tzaddik Of The Seven Wonders</cite>
and <cite>The Wilk Are Among Us!</cite>), Isidore Haiblum has
displayed a weird inventiveness and a loopy, darkly original comic
sense. This book, sadly, is not Haiblum at his best. The premise is
incoherent, the plotting weak, and the denoument rushed and
unconvincing. Skip this one.</p>

<p>RECEIVED AND NOT REVIEWED:</p>

<p>Robots &amp; Aliens #5: Maverick.</p>
