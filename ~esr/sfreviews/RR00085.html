<p>More September catchup...</p>

<pre>
%T Conan The Indomitable
%A Steve Perry
%I TOR
%D September 1990
%O paperback, US$3.95
%P 273
%G 0-812-50860-2
</pre>

<p>Yes, it's Yet Another Conan Pastiche. This one's better than
most (and a <em>lot</em> better than the last one to come out, see
<a href="RR00076.html">RR#76</a>) as it actually includes a few
moments of humor and wit. Perry (author of <cite>The 97th
Step</cite>, <a href="RR00005.html">RR#5</a>) demonstrates once
again that he can turn out an unusually well executed brand of
ultimate-warrior hackery.</p>

<pre>
%T Expecting Someone Taller
%A Tom Holt
%I Berkeley/Ace
%D September 1990
%O paperback, US$3.95
%P 232
%G 0-441-2232-X
</pre>

<p>This wry, funny fantasy makes me want to go out and find a copy
of the author's previous, <cite>Who's Afraid Of Beowulf</cite>. It
tells us the story of what happens when sweet-souled, nebbishy
Malcolm Fisher runs over a magic badger and finds himself possessor
of the Ring of the Nibelungs and putative Master of the World. This
is a big change for the world -- you see, the Ring has never been
borne by anybody <em>nice</em> before. Very shortly he finds his
quiet life intruded on by the Norse gods (a tedious, petulant lot,
most of them) Alberich the Ring-Maker (now a rather bourgeois
geologist with a really <em>chronic</em> case of indigestion) and
the three beautiful Rhinedaughters (gorgeous, predatory cosmic
beach-bunnies who've been scheming to get the Ring back for over a
thousand years). The results are completely delightful and not a
bit tragic -- check your Wagner at the door and enjoy.</p>

<pre>
%T Fugue State/The Death of Dr. Island
%A John M. Ford/Gene Wolfe
%I ROR
%D September 1990
%O paperback, US$3.50
%P 121pp/62pp
%G 0-812-50813-0
</pre>

<p><cite>The Death Of Dr. Island</cite> is a gripping, eerie
speculation on the nature of insanity that works as a dramatic
construction; <cite>Fugue State</cite> is an equally compelling
speculation on sanity that doesn't! The denoument depends on the
assumption that Berkeley and the Hindus were right, that `reality'
is an epiphenomenon of consciousness. Now, regardless of the
philosophical status of this idea, using it as an `explanation' in
fiction is a cop-out only a little more sophisticated than "and
then he woke up." So I'd say pass on this mismatched pair; go find
a copy of <cite>The Death Of Dr. Island And Other Stories And Other
Stories</cite> and enjoy that.</p>

<p>RECEIVED BUT NOT REVIEWED:</p>

<p><cite>Icehenge</cite> (Kim Stanley Robinson), and
<cite>Skyfall</cite> (Harry Harrison). Reissues -- and I thought
they were boring the first time around.</p>
