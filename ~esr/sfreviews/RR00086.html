<h1 class="c1">Raymond's Reviews #86</h1>

<p>More September catchup...</p>

<pre>
%T The Eyes of the Beholder
%A A. C. Crispin
%I Pocket Books
%D September 1990
%O paperback, US$5.95
%P 243
%G 0-671-70010-3
</pre>

<p>Ms. Crispin seems to have a thing about handicaps and adjustment
thereto. In <cite>Silent Dances</cite> (<a
href="RR00079.html">RR#79</a>) a deaf person spents pages
ruminating over whether to have her hearing restored with a new
operation; in this novel, blind but electronically "sighted"
Commander La Forge spends the opening pages contemplating the same
question. Sadly, in <cite>Eyes</cite> the opening scenes are
followed by a melodramatic, cliche-heavy tangle of subplots
apparently intended as a "juvenile" but insulting to the
intelligence of an SF fan of any age. I mean, really -- between the
cute little orphan girl, the Mysterious Alien Force Within The
Sargasso Of Dead Ships, Data's fumbling attempts to write a novel
and sundry thumpingly obvious reactions by characters that were
cardboard to begin with, I was hard put to get halfway through this
dreadful turkey. <cite>Dances</cite> had its problems but wasn't
this bad; more evidence, I guess, for the theory that trekfic
brings out the worst in authors and editors.</p>

<pre>
%T Grass
%A Sheri S. Tepper
%I Bantam/Spectra
%D September 1990
%O paperback, US$5.95
%P 449
%G 0-553-28565-3
</pre>

<p>Sheri S. Tepper has a regrettable tendency to waste a major
imaginative talent on axe-grinding and shaky premises. When she
manages to avoid this she is very good indeed, as
<cite>Grass</cite> demonstrates. The book revolves around a
multi-layered biological puzzle, as Lady Marjorie Westriding of
Earth works to understand the relationship between the Grassian
aristocracy and the creatures they ride in their weird and often
lethal parody of Old Earth's fox hunts. The results are dark and
fascinating. Recommended.</p>

<pre>
%T Fire on the Border
%A Kevin O'Donnell, Jr.
%I ROC
%D September 1990
%O paperback, US$4.95
%P 368
%G 0-451-45030-2
</pre>

<p>The author of <cite>The Journeys of McGill Feighan</cite> and
<cite>Oracle</cite> brings us a hardware-heavy space opera. The
vast and alien Wayholder Empire, committed to endless war against
the devouring nano-replicators of the even more alien Korrin,
begins to use human frontier worlds as training grounds for its
troops. It hands Terra an ultimatum -- permit the slaughter of so
many planetary populations a year or face total annihilation. The
Terran Association submits, neutralizing its vast navies -- but the
colony worlds do not. It falls to two men -- Kajiwara Hoshiro and
his clone-son Daitaku, the last samurai -- to lead the battle
against human defeatism and alien might. The characters are
strictly cardboard but the hardware and tactical ideas quite
original and interesting; if you like hard SF with carefully
thought out space-battle scenes as much as I do, you'll enjoy this
book for that reason alone.</p>

<p>RECEIVED BUT NOT REVIEWED (aka the regular fantasy-series
discard pile):</p>

<p>Game's End (Kevin J. Anderson), Isle of View (Piers Anthony),
Usurper: The Second Book of the Kingdoms (Angus Wells). Is any more
explanation than the titles really necessary...?</p>
