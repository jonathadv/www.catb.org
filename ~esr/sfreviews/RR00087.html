<p>Like <cite>Grass</cite> (<a href="RR00086.html">RR#86</a>), this
is another biological-puzzle book -- somewhat marred by the rather
clumsy telegraphing of the answer early on and a faint but
irritating odor of political correctness, but worth a read.</p>

<p>Kesbe Temiya, a starpilot of mixed Pueblo Indian ancestry, is
forced down in an inaccessable canyon on the planet Oneway while
ferrying an ancient C-47 to its new owner. There she encounters the
People of the Sky, descendants of a rumored lost colony of Pueblo
traditionalists who have reverted to the pre-technological ways of
their ancestors. But there's something new in the mix -- a
partnership with the dragonfly-like "aronan", fliers capable of
bearing the tribe's child warriors. The aronan fascinate her, and
events after the encounter draw her into the life of the tribe.</p>

<p>Kesbe learns to fly and to live in the experiential world of the
People, only to discover she is caught between two cultures when
"her" world re-enters the canyon. Resolution of the value conflict
that has been building through the novel becomes not merely her
private affair but the key to the future of the People.</p>

<p>In many ways this novel is reminiscent of A. C. Crispin's
<cite>Silent Dances</cite> (<a href="RR00079.html">RR#79</a>) and
other examples of the better grade of feminist bildungsromans --
but it works better than most. For one thing, Bell resists the
preachy flavor and sticky earnestness too often found in the type;
and her protagonist is a three-dimensional human being who sweats
and makes little mistakes, rather than a blatant authorial
self-projection of the sort who goofs up only when necessary to
move the plot along. Then, too, Ms. Bell is a pretty good
prose-constructor with a McCaffreyesque knack for the vivid visual
and a nice habit of tossing in a curve or two just when you think
you're sure the plot's cranking off in a too-predicatable
direction.</p>

<p>The book's major flaw, I think, is a familiar one; the extent to
which it romanticizes a pre-technological "tribal" life which was,
in the main, "nasty, brutish and short". There are certainly things
to be learned from such cultures; their art and religion, in
particular, often embody levels of symbolic and psychological
richness that quite surpass most of what the West has to offer.
That said, though, it is still possible to notice (and deplore) the
fact that most writers depict such societies as though there were
indoor toilets, a clinic, and a supermarket just offstage.</p>

<p>There's a corresponding ethical error that treats the choice
between an idealized "yin" of low-technology, environment-friendly,
non-sexist "tribal" living and a "yang" of metallic techno-Western
material wealth as an absolute opposition (usually with the West as
the implicit bad guy). Even leaving aside the question of whether
that romantic "yin" has ever existed, one has to be suspicious of
such binary oppositions. They don't reflect the reports of peoples
now actually making the leap from Stone Age to Information Age in
New Guinea and South America and elsewhere. It's a bit of a shame
that Ms. Bell is still writing from the patronizing belief that
individuals in those cultures have to be "protected" from the
outside world.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, this is a solid journeyman effort that leaves me
looking forward to more work from Ms. Bell.</p>
