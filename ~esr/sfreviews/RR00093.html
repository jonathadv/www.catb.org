<pre>
%T Falkenberg's Legion
%A Jerry Pournelle
%I Baen Books
%D October 1990
%O paperback, US$4.95
%P 432
%G 0-671-72018
</pre>

<p>This reissue marries Pournelle's <cite>The Mercenary</cite> with
<cite>West Of Honor</cite> via a minimum of framing material. These
novels tell the story of John Christian Falkenberg's career in the
Fleet and Marines of the U.S./Soviet alliance called the
CoDominium, and of his second career as a mercenary leader on
planets abandoned by a CoDominium in retrenchment. This is the
future of the great Niven/Pournelle collaboration <cite>The Mote In
God's Eye</cite>, and immediately precedes in narrative time the
recent <cite>Prince Of Mercenaries</cite>.</p>

<p>Pournelle completists will love it, and though it's inferior to
Heinlein or Bujold's military fiction, fans of the genre should
enjoy it. Me...well...</p>

<p>I like good military fiction -- but Pournelle's is morally
disturbing. Most of his characters, unlike Dickson's Dorsai or
other SF versions of the super-fighter, are <em>soldiers</em> (not
self-motivated warriors) -- there's a heavy authoritarian drumbeat,
glorifying people who kill on orders for no other reason than that
they've been ordered to.</p>

<p>Unlike Heinlein, the focus isn't on what an individual might
learn about personal morality and self-reliance from the military
experience -- instead we're treated to lectures on the superior
virtue of military men relative to politicians. Brrr. Granted
politicians are an evil, scummy and hypocritical lot -- but am I
the only person to detect fascist overtones in Pournelle's
glorification of the military?</p>

<p>The difference between the soldier who fights on orders and the
warrior who fights for revenge, gain, glory, or as a form of
quasi-mystical self-realization has often been blurred in SF. Even
SF's soldiers tend (like Bujold's Miles Vorkosigan) to be driven by
a passion to excel at the art of war -- individualists operating
within the fundamental anti- individualism of military systems. Not
Falkenberg, though. Falkenberg is deliberately presented as the
passionless tool of a `duty' which others define for him; a
mercenary in the moral as well as monetary sense.</p>

<p>I am not merely grinding a libertarian axe by this criticism.
Falkenberg's bloodless devotion to statist order is a pivot of the
plot, and drives both his relations with other characters and the
narrative's tendency to lecture. By the time Falkenberg
orchestrates the cold-blooded massacre of Hadley's rebels, the book
has become more conservative propaganda than adventure
narrative.</p>

<p>A comparison with Heinlein's <cite>Starship Troopers</cite> is
instructive here. <cite>ST</cite> was a <em>moral</em> tract rather
than a political one; it dealt primarily with the way in which
individual virtue might be increased and expressed through military
service. Heinlein's MI was open to the society around it,
recruiting people who came from and expected to return to the
mainstream of their culture (it is worth noting here that
Heinlein's society did not, as has been claimed, restrict the
franchise to combat veterans, but merely to those <em>who had
completed a term of government service</em>).</p>

<p>Pournelle's soldiers, by contrast, move in a moral vacuum; they
have no society but each other, no loyalty but `the unit', and a
commander who will commit any atrocity in the belief that "order
must be preserved". Virtue consists not in defending lives or
principles but in obeying orders and maintaining (by cold-blooded
slaughter if necessary) conditions under which civilians must do
likewise.</p>

<p>I don't think one needs to be a libertarian to find this
disturbing -- nor to find the narrative poisoned by it.</p>
