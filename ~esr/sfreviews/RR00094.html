<h1 class="c1">Raymond's Reviews #94</h1>

<pre>
%T Surface Action
%A David Drake
%I Ace
%D October 1990
%O paperback, US$3.95
%P 236
%G 0-441-36375-X
</pre>

<p>More perfunctorily-plotted carnography from the author of
<cite>Cross The Stars</cite> (<a href="RR00066.html">RR#66</a>) and
Killer (<a href="RR00076.html">RR#76</a>). Not helped at all by a
sententious afterword that claims this book was erected on the
`mythic foundation' of 1940s SF. Pass on this one.</p>

<pre>
%T Another Day, Another Dungeon
%A Greg Costikyan
%I TOR
%D October 1990
%O paperback, US$3.95
%P 341
%G 0-812-50140-3
</pre>

<p>This debut is what you'd expect from one of the coauthors of the
late lamented SPI's `Sword and Sorcery' game -- D&amp;D-influenced
humorous fantasy with a bunch of references to the infamous
`Slobbovia' Diplomacy variant campaign thrown in. Yes, I know, that
reference went right by most of you -- and so, sadly, will most of
the in-jokes in this book. Ah well, it's fairly enjoyable even
without them -- but don't mistake it for state of the art.</p>

<pre>
%T Matrix Man
%A William C. Dietz
%I Roc
%D October 1990
%O paperback, US$3.95
%P 251
%G 0-451-45035-3
</pre>

<p>Few things frustrate the serious SF fan more than a good idea
wasted in a ho-hum plot. Matrix Man has one good idea (the Video
Matrix Generator, a computer-animation device that can fake video
`news' sequences indistinguishable from reality). Dietz then
proceeds to waste this wonderful McGuffin on a an utterly
predictable shoot-em-up in which ace newshawk Rex Corvan saves the
world from a very Bondian baddy. The results are strictly junk
reading.</p>

<pre>
%T The Tower of Fear
%A Glen Cook
%I TOR
%D October 1988
%O paperback, US$3.95
%P 375
%G 0-812-50929-3
</pre>

<p>Once again Glen Cook's film-noirish fantasy style delivers a
solid, stimulating entertainment -- a tale of intrigue, treachery
and dark magic within the conquered city of Qushmarrah. As usual
for this author, a large element of the interest lies in the moral
ambiguities the book explores. The guerillas of the Living (the
Qushmarran resistence) have made a demon's bargain with those who
wish to resurrect Nakar the Abomination, the undying warlock who
once held the city in thrall. The Herodian conquerors loot
Qushmarrah and ravage the timber groves that sustain its
industries, but bring the lower classes more stability and
prosperity than they'd ever known. The Dartar, their allies, were
once betrayed by Qushmarrah. Who are the heroes? Who are the
villains? Read this book, and decide for yourself.</p>

<p>BOOKS RECEIVED BUT NOT REVIEWED:</p>

<p>"Davy" by Edgar Pangborn (reissue of a sentimental classic from
1964).</p>

<p>"The Blood of Ten Chiefs 4: Against The Wind" Richard Pini
(ed).</p>

<p>"The Deathgate Cycle II: Eleven Star" by Margaret Weis &amp;
Tracy Hickman.</p>

<p>"Dragonstar I: Stronghold" by Melanie Rawn.</p>

<p>"The World at the End of Time" by Frederik Pohl. A good one, but
I'll wait for the paperback to do the review.</p>
