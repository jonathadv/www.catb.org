<h1 class="c1">Raymond's Reviews #097</h1>

<p>A selection of dreadful bombs for your reading
displeasure...</p>

<pre>
%T The Lost King
%A Margaret Weiss
%I Bantam Spectra
%D Sept 1990
%O paperback, $4.95
%P 458pp
%G 0-553-28600-5
</pre>

<p>Wretchedly trashy space opera by one of the perpetrators behind
TSR's endless series of formula fantasies for preadolescents.
Handle with tongs.</p>

<pre>
%T Chicago Red
%A R. M. Meluch
%I ROC
%D October 1990
%O $4.95
%P 319pp
%G 0-451-45034-5
</pre>

<p>The quality of this book can be judged by the fact that one of
the early scenes consists of a major character being upset because
he can't manage to forcibly sodomize the protagonist. This is gay
sado-porn disguised as SF. Unless your sexual imprints are ...
unusual in that particular way, you'll likely find it pointless and
disgusting.</p>

<pre>
%T Winterlong
%A Elizabeth Hand
%I Bantam/Spectra
%D October 1990
%O paperback, US$4.95
%P 442
%G 0-553-28772-9
</pre>

<p>This piece of New-Waveness-gone-berserk has already been
adequately dissected by Tom Easton in Analog. I can only add that
it sppears to be an expansion of the author's story in Full
Spectrum II (<a href="RR00060.html">RR#60</a>).</p>

<pre>
%T Gundam II: Escalation
%A Yoshiuki Tomino
%I DelRey
%D November 1990
%O paperback, US$4.95
%P 209
%G 0-345-35739-6
</pre>

<p>More wretched space-opera, without even the mediocre writing of
<cite>The Lost King</cite> to recommend it.</p>

<pre>
%T The Legion of Space
%A Jack Williamson
%I Collier Books
%D Dec 1990
%O paperback, US$4.95
%P 189
%G 0-02-038-355-X
</pre>

<p>And yet <em>more</em> wretched space opera. However, this one
has an important redeeming quality -- it was the first of its kind!
Yes, this book dates from 1935. It is thus of some historical
interest.</p>

<p>RECEIVED BUT NOT REVIEWED:</p>

<p>"The King of Light and Shadows" by Adrian Cole (Avon).<br />
 "Bridgehead" David Drake. reaissue from '86.<br />
 Becoming Alien #3: "Human to Human" by Rebecca Ore.<br />
 Merovingen Nights #6: "Flood Tide" (C.J. Cherryh, ed)<br />
 Time of the Fox by Matthew J. Costello.<br />
