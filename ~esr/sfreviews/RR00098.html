<pre>
%T Phoenix
%A Steven Brust
%I Berkeley/Ace
%D November 1990
%O paperback, US$4.50
%P 245
%G 0-441-66225-0
</pre>

<p>Brust's life of Vlad Taltos, a human professional assassin in a
society of elves, continues to twist and turn in unexpected ways.
Vlad takes a commission from his patron deity with consequences
that jeopardize all the fragile security he has built up within the
underworld of the Draegaran Empire. There's some sign in this book
that he's beginning to learn from his mistakes...and the ending is
wide open. As usual, the characterization is interesting and new
facets of an odd and fascinating universe are revealed. I'll read
the next one.</p>

<pre>
%T The Fortress of Eternity
%A Andrew Whitmore
%I Avon
%D November 1990
%O paperback, US$3.50
%P 251
%G 0-380-75744-3
</pre>

<p>You can judge this book by its cover. Formulaic fantasy, not
redeemed by pseudo-metaphysical maunderings in the last third.
Whitmore's one touch of originality -- deliberately writing a
<em>depressing</em> heroic fantasy -- makes matters worse.</p>

<pre>
%T Venus Prime #5: The Diamond Moon
%A Paul Preuss and Arthur C. Clarke
%I Avon
%D November 1990
%O paperback, US$3.95
%P 278
%G 0-380-75349-9
</pre>

<p>More SF adventure and conspiratorial skulduggery as Preuss's
version of the bionic superwoman investigates an alien artifact
hidden within the fifth moon of Jupiter. The gimmick in this series
is that each novel is built around a recycled Arthur C. Clarke
short story. In this one the seams are pretty well hidden, but the
series concept is definitely getting old. We do find out more about
the Prophetae, though.</p>

<pre>
%T The Mutant Season
%A Robert Silverberg &amp; Karen Haber
%I Bantam Spectra
%D November 1990
%O paperback, US$4.95
%P 289
%G 0-553-28629-3
</pre>

<p>This ho-hum political potboiler (first of a series) is set in a
near future in which a 400-year-old group of psionically-gifted
mutants has publicly `come out' and is attempting to deal with
increasing intolerance from the `normals'. Uninteresting as SF, it
seems targeted at the `bestseller' market; it contains lots of sex,
skulduggery, and political power games. Yawn...</p>

<pre>
%T Insurrection
%A David Weber &amp; Steve Wite
%I Baen Book
%D November 1990
%O paperback, US$4.50
%P 408
%G 0-671-72024-4
</pre>

<p>This is yet another
plucky-colony-worlds-against-decadent-oppressive-Terra space opera,
unfortunately neither as well written nor as original as last
month's <cite>Fire On The Border</cite> (<a
href="RR00086.html">RR#86</a>). But if you like lots of gaudy space
battle scenes you'll enjoy it anyhow. Enough said.</p>
