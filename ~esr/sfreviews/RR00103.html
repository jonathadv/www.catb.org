<h1 class="c1">Raymond's Reviews #103</h1>

<p>I've been busy with my <em>own</em> book for months now, but I'm
finally out from under and Raymond's Reviews will start appearing
regularly once again -- but mostly short takes until I catch up.
This is January releases #2.</p>

<pre>
%T The Black Throne
%A Roger Zelazny/Fred Saberhagen
%I Baen
%D October 1990
%O paperback, US$4.95
%P 278
%G 0-671-72013-9
</pre>

<p>In "The Black Throne," Zelazny and Saberhagen have produced a
unique science fantasy featuring, as its hero, an alternate-time
version of Edgar Allen Poe. As if that were not tribute enough to
the famous poet, all the characters and many of the scenes are
borrowed directly from Poe's stories and poems. Readers with an
encyclopedic knowledge of Poe will enjoy tracing the references;
others will appreciate the zaniness of cramming an intelligent
orangutang, a living corpse, a sorceress, the Inquisition, and a
Dutch balloonist into the same plot. Zelazny and Saberhagen
obviously wrote "The Black Throne" for the fun of it, and that fun
makes what might otherwise have been a silly, pretentious piece of
fluff an enjoyable read. [This by guest reviewer Cathy Olanich --

<pre>
%T King of the Scepter'd Isle
%A Michael Greatrex Corey
%I Roc Fantasy
%D November 1990
%O paperback, US$4.50
%P 399
%G 0-451-45042-6
</pre>

<p>"King of the Scepter'd Isle" is the second volume of Coney's
Arthurian science fiction epic. Yes, that's right -- science
fiction epic. Crucial parts of the action, which literally spans
many millenia, turn on the decisions of gnomes, who are aliens from
another world and another time line. . . . Elements of Arthurian
myth, comic fantasy, alternate history fiction, and mysticism blend
and merge into a funny, bizarre, touching drama that (usually)
doesn't strain the reader's credulity too much. With or without its
prequel, "Fang the Gnome," "King of the Scepter'd Isle" is a
diverting quick read from one of the most original new writers of
the decade. [This by guest reviewer Cathy Olanich -- ESR]</p>

<pre>
%T  The Dream Compass
%A  Jeff Bredenberg
%I  Avon
%D January 1991
%O paperback, US$3.50
%P 180
%G  0-380-75647-1
</pre>

<p>In a scant 180 pages, Jeff Bredenberg sketches for the reader a
post-Holocaust society called "Merqua," a web of work and prison
camps controlled by a huge bureaucracy which is run by an anonymous
figure called "the Monitor." Literacy is a crime in Merqua, and
magic (or telepathy or shamanism, or whatever term the reader
prefers) coexists with remnants of pre-Holocaust technology.
Caveat: Bredenberg's story emerges in a series of vignettes instead
of a cohesive narrative, and even a reader familiar with the
typical motifs of post-Holocaust fiction may have difficulty
figuring out what is going on. Still, judging by "The Dream
Compass," a surprisingly concise and vigorous first novel,
Bredenberg is an author worth watching. [This by guest reviewer
