<h1 class="c1">Raymond's Reviews #109</h1>

<p>I've been busy with my <em>own</em> book for months now, but I'm
finally out from under and Raymond's Reviews will start appearing
regularly once again -- but mostly short takes until I catch up.
This is January releases #4.</p>

<pre>
%T Beyond the Gate of Worlds
%A Robert Silverberg, John Brunner, Chelsea Quinn Yarbro
%I Tor
%D January 1991
%O paperback, US$3.95
%P 280
%G 0-812-55444-2
</pre>

<p>"Beyond the Gate of Worlds" is a collection of three novellas
set in an alternate universe in which more than half, instead of
one-quarter, of Europe's population died of the Black Plague. In
the twentieth century of this world, European colonization of the
New World never occurred, the Industrial Revolution never took
place, and the centuries-old Turkish empire is only just beginning
to crumble (Shakespeare's plays, in fact, were written in Turkish).
Although the novellas fail to live up to the promise implicit in
this premise, they are worth reading for the glimpses they afford
into a fascinating world we were fortunate to escape. [Guest
reviewer: Cathy Olanich]</p>

<pre>
%T Gnome Man's Land
%A Esther Friesner
%I Ace
%D January 1991
%O paperback, US$4.50
%P 235
%G 0-441-08122-3
</pre>

<p>"Gnome Man's Land," like most of Friesner's books, is crammed to
bursting with sly puns and slapstick antics by exotic "fairy"
creatures. Often the juxtaposition of such antics with the daily
activities of real-world humans results in side- splitting humor.
This time it doesn't, possibly because Friesner chronicles for us
too many of the mundane woes of her likeable adolescent hero, Tim
Desmond, before moving on to the meat of the story. Still, even
flawed Friesner is a better read than the efforts of many of the
less skilled writers who attempt comic fantasy. (N.B. The
back-cover blurb is wrong -- Tim's mother does NOT fall in love
with a medieval magician in this story!) [Guest reviewer: Cathy
Olanich]</p>

<pre>
%T The Tenth Class
%A Karen Ripley
%I DelRey
%D January 1991
%O paperback, US$3.95
%P 300
%G 0-345-37033-3
</pre>

<p>This book reads like a sequel (possibly to the only previous
novel by the author listed in the front, <cite>Prisoner Of
Dreams</cite>), but it makes me want to <em>read</em> the prequel.
Ripley's protagonist has discovered that a group of renegades is
manipulating her society's genetic classification system for
nefarious ends. Her lover is one of the victims, so she intends to
do something about it. One welcome touch of realism is that she
<em>does</em>n't have to take on most of her society
single-handed...</p>
