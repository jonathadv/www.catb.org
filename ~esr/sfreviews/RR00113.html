<p>Popular fantasy or science-fiction series often spawn
quasi-historic or quasi-scholarly books of commentary.
Imaginatively done, such commentaries can enhance the reader's
experience of the original fantasy world, or entice a reader who is
unfamilar with that world. Unfortunately, "Deryni Magic," which
purports to be a volume commentary about the magic used by the
Deryni of Gwynedd, does little more than take up space on the
bookshelf.</p>

<p>"Deryni Magic" contains very little, if any, detail about magic,
the Deryni, or Gwynedd, that cannot be found in the other Deryni
books. Indeed, most of the text consists of quotes from the other
books -- often for pages at a time. In addition, 34 pages of
closely-spaced text is reserved exclusively for a list of
references to the various types of magical acts perpetrated in the
pages of the Deryni novels and short stories Kurtz has already
written. Although some Deryni fans may well appreciate having these
references collected in one place, it scarcely justifies subtitling
this book "A Grimoire" -- or charging a $5.95 cover price.</p>

<p>Where Kurtz does not pad her text with quotes or references to
her previous books, she engages in some of the most trite and
unimaginative commentary this reviewer has ever read. Primarily,
she resummarizes whatever descriptions of magical activity or
indulges in inconclusive speculation, laced with teasers about
stories "that will be told." The following excerpt from what
purports to be a discussion of Saint Camber's experience during his
ordination is characteristic of Kurtz's approach:</p>

<p>All of Camber's experience takes place within his mind, of
course, within a real elapsed time of merely a few seconds. To any
human observer witnessing the rite, only the physical act of laying
on hands would have been apparent, though a particularly perceptive
and spiritual human priest might have inferred some kind of inner
process taking place, based on his own experience of ordination,
and might even have perceived some change in Camber's psychic aura.
Even without the agency of a Deryni bishop consciously channeling
such a flow of power, we have reports of similar experiences of
spiritual ecstasy in our own world. ("Deryni Magic," pp.
27-28).</p>

<p>It would be speculation to surmise Kurtz's motives for writing
"Deryni Magic" merely from perusing the book, but it certainly
appears that this volume was produced with the sole purpose of
wringing even more money from her loyal cadre of Deryni fans. And
it's sad that she has chosen to repay their loyalty with this
worthless piece of self-plagiarism.</p>
