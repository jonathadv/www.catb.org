<h1 class="c1">Raymond's Reviews #120</h1>

<p>End of April catchup, into May 1991.</p>

<pre>
%T The Initiate Brother
%A Sean Russell
%I DAW
%D April 1991
%O paperback, US$4.99
%P 480
%G 0-88677-466-7
</pre>

<p>The bad news about this book is that, although not labelled as
"Volume 1" it ends on a cliffhanger setup for a sequel. The good
news is you'll probably want to read the sequel. The world may be a
pastiche of every orientophile cliche there is, but Russell knows
how to plot and draw interesting characters. And the book's
McGuffin --- the central esoteric power of the Botahist monks ---
is not only original but plausible, in that one can believe it
without making any supernaturalist assumptions. Fun stuff, even if
it does read a bit too much like an out-take from the old Kung Fu
TV series in spots.</p>

<pre>
%T Blind Justice
%A S. N. Lewitt
%I Ace
%D April 1991
%O paperback, US$4.50
%P 262
%G 0-441-71843-4
</pre>

<p>This dark, atmospheric tale of revolution, betrayal and revenge
shows that Lewitt has a wider range than just the military-flavored
cyberpunk of her earlier novels <cite>Cyberstealth</cite> and
<cite>Dancing Vac</cite>. Unfortunately, she can't seem to think of
any more imaginative ending than to kill off her characters and
doom the world. Better luck next time.</p>

<pre>
%T When The Music's Over
%E Lewis Shiner
%I Bantam
%D May 1991
%O paperback, US$5.95
%P 322
%G 0-553-28985-3
</pre>

<p>This theme anthology of anti-war, anti-violence stories displays
all the earnestness, anguish, good intentions, empathy, and ethical
muddleheadedness typical of the peace movement. The beginning and
end stories exemplify this best, by offering `solutions' to the
problem of war that involve secret coercive mind-alteration on a
massive scale. Others confuse the problem of war with the
ecological tragedy of the commons, or with the communication gap
between the sexes, or with any of several other trendy causes. All
seem pegged to the notion (readily dispelled by any study of animal
ethology) that homo sapiens is a uniquely vicious and innately
aggressive species. Nevertheless, there is some excellent writing
here, especially in Walter Jon Williams's "Prayers On The Wind" and
Paul J. McAuley's "The Invisible Country". Buy it used, ignore the
preachiness of the minor pieces, and enjoy.</p>
