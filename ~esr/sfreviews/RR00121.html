<p>Dave Duncan demonstrates his usual quiet competence and wisdom
in this book, the same qualities that made <cite>The Magic
Casement</cite> (<a href="RR00100.html">RR#100</a>) and previous
novels such as <cite>West Of January</cite> and <cite>The Reluctant
Swordsman</cite> such satisfying fare. This time, though, he's
after something else. This book is a pointed but never clumsy or
cruel satire of the testosterone-fueled wish-fulfillment
space-opera.</p>

<p>Vaun, the protagonist, is the ultimate space-patrolman, a hero
who has saved his planet --- condemned by it to a deadening round
of publicity work on his society's equivalent of the rubber-chicken
circuit. And the Patrol he serves is a corrupt oligarchy of which
the best thing that can be said is, the alternatives are worse.</p>

<p>Still sharper is Duncan's extrapolation of what life-extension
drugs have done to Vaun's world. On Ult, long life has dessicated
the family bond and encouraged a vicious, careless sort of hedonism
that worships youth and makes final senescence more taboo than
murder. Vaun's people are perpetual adolescents without the growth
possibilities of adolescents, self-imprisoned on a merry-go-round
of duels, orgies, and essentially meaningless status games. And the
system is slowly failing as their technology decays and no one
bothers to fix it.</p>

<p>Vaun, we learn, is a cuckoo --- seeded on Ult by a secretive
Brotherhood of cloned superman who believe themselves to be the
vanguard of evolution, destined to replace the erratic "random"
humans. Though he declared his loyalty to the normal humanity that
raised him, and saved his world from the Brotherhood once, he has
never been really trusted. Now, the Brotherhood is making its
second move on Ult. And Vaun is not sure where, in fact, his
loyalties lie...</p>

<p>Sounds grim, doesn't it? But the remarkable thing about Duncan's
book is that it is not just an obvious cynical bummer or a
collection of cheap shots at Doc Smith. The author is wiser than
that. His world may be a hard place filled mostly with people who
can do only as their natures require, but the struggle matters ---
even if only to those doing the struggling.</p>

<p>Wheteher you read this as straight adventure or for the levels
of reference Duncan has embedded in it, you'll find it entertains
and intrigues.</p>
