<p>Ian McDonald's previous novels (<cite>Desolation Road</cite>,
<cite>Out On Blue Six</cite>) have attracted lots of critical
praise, but they read to me like too much writing talent chasing
not enough idea --- gorgeous, but rambling and self-indulgent and a
bit too self-consciously clever. In this, his third, he finally
hits his stride, treating more idea content with a new maturity and
discipline. The result is a work of surpassing excellence that
bears comparison with the best of Tim Powers, Robert Holdstock, or
Charles De Lint.</p>

<p>The premise is that the human unconscious has access to the
Universe's fundamental forces, and human mythmaking has created a
sort of esoteric geography of `mythlines' overlaying the geological
landscape. Some humans can sense the mythlines; a very few can
create fairies, gods and demons to haunt them. Fantasy? SF? Who
cares?</p>

<p>The novel is set in Ireland, which is just naturally
<em>crawling</em> with mythlines. In 1913, an adolescent girl,
driven by her repressed sexuality and drunk on the Celtic Twilight
romanticism of Yeats &amp; Co., makes contact with the energy of
the mythlines --- the power of Faerie. She becomes fully
mythoconscious, able to tap the energy to project thought-forms
into the world as the creatures of Fenian myth, and eventually
undergoes a bizarre apotheosis.</p>

<p>The potential for mythoconsciousness is a heritable trait. In
parts II (set in the 1930s) and III (present-day), her descendents
grapple with the consequences of her weird and terrible power.
Eventually her great-granddaughter will confront her and the hosts
of Faerie, wielding not grimoires or pentagrams but the Two Swords
of Kendo and a personal computer.</p>

<p>There's lots of terrific writing here; strong characters,
evocative description, joy and pathos and catharsis. MacDonald's
always had this, but...in <cite>Desolation Road</cite>, the
fireworks weren't really <em>about</em> anything, they
(dis)organized into a loosely connected series of vignettes that
trailed off into a weak ending. In <cite>Out On Blue Six</cite>
MacDonald had an idea, all right, but it was a pretty hackneyed one
that got overwhelmed by all the gorgeous imagery he wanted to hang
off it. This novel is leaner, with more sinew and a real plot that
really moves.</p>

<p>Oh, there are defects here and there. The dreadful secret of the
great-granddaughter's childhood seems a bit too pat, too obvious,
too 1991-fashionable, and that hurts the ending a bit. There's a
touch of earnest Marxist silliness that sticks out in the middle of
an otherwise gripping interior monologue on the complexity of
modern evil. And, though the possibility of <em>other</em>
mythoconscious humans and their impact on the history of religion
is raised, the entities we see remain sealed off from the
thought-forms of living religions. But these minor flaws stick out
only because of the remarkable and consistent quality of the
rest.</p>

<p>If McDonald has any more novels in him of this calibre, we can
count ourselves fortunate indeed.</p>
