<p>Diane Duane's talent for making silk purses out of the deadliest
sow's-ear cliches in SF and Fantasy has been well demonstrated
before (notably in several of the best Star Trek novels; see <a
href="RR00058.html">RR#58</a>). She and partner Morwood do it again
with this novel, elevating what ought to have been a piece of
repellent hack-work into the Good Stuff category by sheer force of
good writing. The two tough-cop viewpoint characters the authors
send chasing an orbital drug ring become three-dimensional and
real; some minor characters pull surprises that work; and the
world, while unsurprising, has the little touches of detail that
keep you persuaded. Ignore the sleazy cover and enjoy.</p>

<p>In a future America overrun by fanatical anti-technologists and
menaced by rapidly advancing glaciers, who will come to the rescue
of two astronauts from a space habitat, downed on the Ice by a
missile? Why...science-fiction fandom, of course --- or, what's
left of it. This book is a tissue of in-jokes, puns, and characters
based on real people instantly recognizable to any long-time fan.
The goings-on get a bit too cute to justify the Hugo it's been
nominated for, but this is good clean fun --- and a don't-miss for
anyone who's ever enjoyed an SF convention.</p>

<pre>
%T The Clouds of Saturn
%A Michael McCollum
%I Del Rey
%D July 1991
%O paperback, US$4.95
%P 311
%G 0-345-36412-0
</pre>

<p>Larson Sands is a privateer in the clouds of Saturn's upper
atmosphere, humanity's refuge ever since a jump in the Sun's
activity made Earth uninhabitable. Despite the risks, he enjoys
life as a mercenary in the limited wars among the fragile cloud
cities --- until one of them murders his brother. His quest for
revenge eventually sends him after a secret buried on dead Earth.
This is competent adventure SF in an unlikely and interesting
setting, a fun read-once.</p>
