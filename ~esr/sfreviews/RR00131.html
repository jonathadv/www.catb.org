<pre>
%T The Albino Knife
%A Steve Perry
%I Ace
%D July 1991
%O paperback, US$4.95
%P 294
%G ISBN 0-441-01391-0
</pre>

<p>More in the Matador universe from the author of <cite>The 97th
Step</cite> (<a href="RR00005.html">RR#005</a>) and the best third
of <cite>The Harriers</cite> (<a href="RR00118.html">RR#118</a>).
Unfortunately, Perry was clearly having an off day when he wrote
this; the action scenes are listless, the characters lack most of
what life they'd acquired in the previous books, and nothing
further is done with the rather crisp and tasty mystical elements
relating to the Brothers of the Shroud. Give it a miss.</p>

<pre>
%T Cat-a-lyst
%A Alan Dean Foster
%I Ace
%D July 1991
%O paperback, US$4.95
%P 325
%G ISBN 0-441-64661-1
</pre>

<p>This is a better book than Foster's previous outing <cite>Cyber
Way</cite> (<a href="RR00051.html">RR#51</a>) but not by much. As
usual, Foster gets real cute; cats as superior aliens,
extraterrestrial invasion by refugee Incas wielding subliminal TV
as their main weapon, and help for poor humanity from giant
sentient carrots who talk like Victorians 'cause they used to hang
out with Lewis Carroll. Unfortunately the result has such visible
seams and the noise from turning plot-gears is so loud that it's
hard to enjoy the jokes. Buy it used, maybe.</p>

<pre>
%T Only Begotten Daughter
%A James Morrow
%I Ace
%D July 1991
%O paperback, US$4.95
%P 312
%G ISBN 0-441-63041-1
</pre>

<p>Other people have different prejudices, but to me a theological
novel that is blurbed "it deserves to be measured against the best
in American literature" has two strikes against it from the start
--- I'm led to expect a pompous, pretentious, sprawling,
angst-ridden turkey like John Kessel's <cite>Good News From Outer
Space</cite> (<a href="RR00071.html">RR#71</a>). This novel manages
(albeit narrowly) to avoid that trap, perhaps because the author
(unlike Kessel) seems to genuinely like his characters. All of
them. Jacob Katz, the mild-mannered Jewish recluse and bookworm who
lives in a lighthouse, makes his living donating to a sperm bank,
and is more than shocked when he discovers he's the parthogenetic
father of a divine daughter. Julie, the luckless and otherwise
ordinary Girl Next Door who happens to be the daughter of God, able
to walk on water and perform miracles but fairly sure for various
reasons that she should not. Phoebe, her worldly-wise and
polymorphously-perverse best friend. Even the Devil --- a dedicated
professional extremely distressed by the decay of sin-inducing
Christianity, determined to see Julie sacrificed on a new cross to
guarantee the founding of a religion even more thoroughly wedded to
fanaticism, blood and evil. Then, too, Morrow's theological
speculations are quirky and original (if not always convincing).
Unlike <cite>Stranger In A Strange Land</cite>, this novel has no
particular moral subtext, no prescription for saving the world. Its
central, subtle theme is that we are <em>all</em> in Julie's shoes,
trapped divinities grappling with the Problem of Evil; it is a
victory simply to have our own lives against all the odds. This may
seem too pessimistic for some (it is for me) but it's an
improvement on the usual modern "literary" message that even the
attempt to own your own life is futile. The result isn't a great
book, but it is a good one.</p>
