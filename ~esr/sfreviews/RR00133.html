<pre>
%T The Shining Ones
%S Venus Prime
%V Book 6
%A Paul Preuss
%A Arthur C. Clarke
%I Avon
%D August 1991
%O paperback, US$3.95
%P 262
%G ISBN 0-380-75350-2
</pre>

<p>This oddly-constructed series (each novel a short story by
Arthur C. Clarke embedded more or less seamlessly in a novel by
Preuss) lurches in this volume to a mildly disappointing
conclusion. A few of them were lots of fun, trading on a fizzy mix
of space opera and sinister conspiracy theory. In this one, Sparta
the bionic woman and her lover Blake Redfield finally confront the
super-aliens behind the Knowledge of the sinister Prophetae of the
Free Spirit. Unfortunately, the narrative viewpoint is neither of
them; rather, we see the aliens, some world-smashing pyrotechnics,
and some rather implausible time-travel paradoxes through the eyes
of a normal human unequipped to understand what's really going on.
The result aims at Stapledonian grandeur but ends up subtly
out-of-focus. Don't bother unless you've read the previous
five.</p>

%T Lunar Justice
%A Charles Harness
%I Avon
%D August 1991
%O paperback, US$4.95
%P 180
%G ISBN 0-380-76010-X
</pre>

<p>Charles Harness has a very weird mind. In this book, a patent
attorney saves a client from being guillotined on the Moon for high
treason, by psionically blowing up the planet Jupiter. This sort of
thing might be over-the-top fun, if Harness's world weren't such a
tissue of unjustified absurdities. To name just one, society shows
no signs of having adapted in any way to the existence of psionic
supermen who can induce nuclear reactions from planetary distances.
Pass on this unless you cultivate a taste for the bizarre and don't
care that the world-design is ludicrous and the plot utterly
contrived.</p>

<pre>
%T Specterworld
%A Isidore Haiblum
%I Avon Books
%D August 1991
%O paperback, US$3.95
%P 215
%G ISBN 0-380-75858-X
</pre>

<p>Isidore Haiblum's writing style is a kind of edgy, gritty
surrealism that works very well with some premises and very poorly
with others --- something like a cross between Philip K. Dick and
Keith Laumer with a soupcon of Ron Goulart. Unfortunately,
<cite>Specterworld</cite> wasn't written on a good day for him. The
Chandleresque first-person narration is flat and unconvincing; the
plot, in which the boss gumshoe of a robot rent-a-cop service
confronts his evil clones amidst a whirl of alternate universes, is
thin and hard to follow. Pass on this one.</p>
