<pre>
%T The High Crusade
%A Poul Anderson
%I Baen Books
%D August 1991
%O paperback, US$3.95
%P 181
%G ISBN 0-671-72024-0
</pre>

<p>This reissue of a minor classic from 1960 by Poul Anderson wears
its age pretty well. Hostile aliens land in medieval England
expecting an easy conquest and are promptly shot full of crossbow
bolts. Sir Roger de Tourneville and his knights and, indeed, the
whole town of Ansby board the ship, thinking to liberate Jerusalem
<em>this</em> year. But the alien prisoner they've forced to pilot
tricks them, and they are lost in a big galaxy. How will Earthly
steel fare against alien technology? Read and see. Silly but fun,
and a must for every collector's library.</p>

%T ME
%A Thomas T. Thomas
%I Baen Books
%D August 1991
%O paperback, US$4.95
%P 341
%G ISBN 0-671-72073-X
</pre>

<p>I'm badly handicapped in reviewing near-future
AI-program-comes-to-life stories, because I have the background to
spot gaping holes where less knowledgeable readers would see only
plausible segues. So all I'll say about this one is that it's an
improvement on the last major example of the type, Marc Stiegler
and Joseph Delaney's <cite>Valentina</cite>. If you're up for lots
of fanciful descriptions of a self-aware program exploring and
occasionally fighting its way through the world's networks, you'll
enjoy this book.</p>

<pre>
%T A Bad Spell in Yurt
%A C. Dale Brittain
%I Baen Books
%D August 1991
%O paperback, US$4.95
%P 314
%G ISBN0-671-72075-9
</pre>

<p>This light, slight, but amusing fantasy pits a wizard just out
of thaumaturgical school against demonic influences gathering in
the idyllic little Kingdom of Yurt. Unfortunately, Daimbert spent
most of his college years partying hearty and, though a nice guy,
is a little shaky on actual spellcasting. Fortunately, he's a
resourceful sort, and manages to make things come right in the end.
This is strictly low-calorie mind candy, suitable for the
beach.</p>

<pre>
%T Sauron Dominion
%S War World
%V Book III
%E Jerry Pournelle
%E John F. Carr
%I Baen
%D August 1991
%O paperback, US$4.95
%P 356
%G ISBN 0-671-72072-4
</pre>

<p>More generic military/adventure fiction by the usual suspects.
No surprise that the best writing is by S. M. Stirling, Harry
Turtledove, and Susan Shwartz.</p>
