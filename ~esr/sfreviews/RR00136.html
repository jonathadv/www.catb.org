<p>The deCamps deliver yet another example of their trademark brand
of light, humorous fantasy. This one (set in the world of <cite>The
Incorporated Knight</cite>, but with different characters) concerns
the adventures of Thorolf Zigramson, a would-be academic doing a
hitch in the army of Rhaetia, after he makes the acquaintance of
the proud Countess Yvette in a manner that leaves him in little
doubt of her uncommon beauty. He falls in love with her, of course;
but what follows sends up all the cliches of heroic fantasy and
romance and scatters them in confusion. The gentle, bawdy wit of
<cite>The Honorable Barbarian</cite> (<a
href="RR00054.html">RR#54</a>) is in full evidence here. Enjoy!</p>

<p>Yet another Battletech(tm) book. Looks like they're starting a
new series with this one; a standard coming-of-age tale that wears
its debt to half-a-dozen other pieces of generic military fiction
rather obviously. Oh, well, it's at least competent hackery. Seems
primarily to be a sort of book-length establishing shot for the
further adventures of Aidan the warleader. Battletech fans will
enjoy; everyone else can ignore.</p>

<p>CORRECTION:</p>

<p>Due to a slight collision in my hash tables, I recently
mis-identified <cite>Fallen Angels</cite> as a Hugo nominee. The
book I had in mind was <cite>Queen Of Angels</cite> by Greg
Bear.</p>

<p>RECEIVED BUT NOT REVIEWED:</p>

<p>Dragonsword #2: <cite>Duel Of Dragons</cite> by Gael Baudino. Is
any other explanation than the name really necessary?</p>

<p>Star Trek #56: <cite>Legacy</cite> by Michael Jan Friedman.</p>

<p>Merovingen Nights #7: <cite>Endgame</cite>, C. J. Cherryh
(ed.)</p>
