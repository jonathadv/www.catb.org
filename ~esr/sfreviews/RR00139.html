<p>For once, the back-cover blurb doesn't lie. This really is a
very funny novel with a bite underneath the gags. It takes all the
cliches of Man Exploring The Solar System, Head Held High, and
inverts them to hilarious effect.</p>

<p>It is sometime in the not-too-distant future. The U.S.
government has long since sold off its space program (along with
the Navy, the Park Service, the Smithsonian and about everything
else). The lawyers and megacorporations are kings. The Soviet Union
is gone. And the only entity left with both the money and the
desire to finish an abandoned Mars project is --- Hollywood.</p>

<p>Hollywood, in the person of a B-movie producer named Markson
trying for the coup of his career. So he assembles a crew; an
ex-cosmonaut, an ex-astronaut, a Hollywood doctor, a dwarf
production genius and two Movie Stars. No mistake about the
capitals; Cary Fonda-Fox IV and Beverly Glen are gene-engineered
thoroughbreds born to a hereditary aristocracy. They board a
mothballed Mars ship completed years before one step ahead of a
pack of lawyers and head for the Red Planet to make the ultimate
docu-drama.</p>

<p>The plot doesn't really matter much in this book. It's the
sparks it spins off in all directions that entertain --- Bisson's
funny, half-savage reflections on show business run amuck and what
happens when art and life promiscuously imitate each other to
provide cheap thrills for an audience that never really cared
anyhow.</p>

<p>He also has a lot of fun dynamiting the high seriousness of most
projections of space travel. In one priceless trashing of the
astronauts-coming-out-of-hibernation scene, they are deliberately
awakened by a sound "most Americans associate with comfort and
security" --- the audio tracks from cheesy Saturday morning
cartoons.</p>

<p>A lot of other authors would have continually mugged the reader
with <em>significance</em>, turning the book into a very depressing
and nasty production relieved only by the implied exhortation that
you ought to be <em>enjoying</em> this message because it's
<em>good</em> for you. Not Bisson; he likes his characters and is
too busy having a good time to be really heavy.</p>

<p>All the same, expect to feel a few barbs. Bisson's novel of the
future is very much a satire about our present. But a serious flaw
in that respect is that Bisson can't seem to decide what to be
angry about. On an ethical level his whole future sucks and
everyone is guilty, if only by acquiescence; even his
revolutionaries are sad failures. The edgy post-modern humor is
matched by a paralyzing post-modern vagueness about what went wrong
and why, a sort of permanent floating alienation that makes refusal
to take a definite ethical stance into a virtue.</p>

<p>The result is a funny book that wants to be something more but
never quite makes it. You can see the tag-ends of a moral argument
hanging here and there, but they never come together. Bisson seems
content to disturb, to joke, to suggest, to allude, rather than
even implying anything really thought-provoking as an alternative
to what he's spoofing. Though in some ways that makes for a more
easily digestible kind of humor, it rather vitiates the book as
satire.</p>
