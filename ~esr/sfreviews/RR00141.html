<p>The author of the well-loved "Sector General" stories and the
underrated <cite>The Watch Below</cite> gives us tasty
alternate-history space adventure. In the fourteenth century of a
timeline that saw Hiero of Alexandria's toy steam engines brought
to the court of the High King of Ireland seven centuries
previously, the Empire of Hibernia is the dominant power of Earth
--- and the leading member of the international consortium that
will build the "Aisling Gheal", Earth's first starship.</p>

<p>Healer Nolan is the most junior of the ship's officers, its
surgeon, and a male pioneer in a calling traditionally exclusive to
women. His ability has gained him a place beside the
priest-officers of the starship in spite of the powerful Hibernian
Church's reluctance to admit a non-believer.</p>

<p>A series of accidents and his unguarded tongue land him in
situations which reveal that the high-level politics of the mission
are far more complicated and murky than they might appear. It
begins to seem that the deadliest threats the crew may face come
not from the alien world they are to explore but from within the
crew's own ranks.</p>

<p>Only some powerful friends made in unexpected places keep Nolan
on the mission. And when, after planetfall, Nolan and a contingent
of colonists are shuttled down thousands of miles from the colony
site, this begins to seem less and less like a blessing. Then it is
that Nolan's story begins to echo, eerily, the doings of the
legendary Brendan the Navigator, discoverer of the Westland and
(later) honored Paramount Chief of the Iroquois Nation...</p>

<p>This novel is lots of fun; an improvement in that respect on
White's previous <cite>Federation World</cite>, which, while
brimming with neat SFnal idea content and alien biologies, was
rather stiff in the joints. White learned his auctorial trade a
long time ago, and in some respects his style hasn't changed much
since; the result is a book that is semi-nostalgically reminiscent
of the best in '50s and '60s magazine SF --- but with much a much
franker treatment of sexual elements. One can almost imagine it as
a reprint of an Analog or Galaxy serial that never was.</p>

<p>I thought White was particularly successful at evoking
authenticity in characters, who, while living in a technological
society, feel the constraints of hierarchy and religious taboo far
more strongly than even very conservative sorts in ours would. My
own experience of Catholic schools made the merciless
pseudo-benignity of the Hibernian Church seem very real to me;
White makes the ethical point of his story stronger than it might
have been by painting the scheming Monsignor O'Riordan not as a
villain but as an ethical man acting out the consequences of evil,
dangerous moral errors inculcated in him by his religion. The
implied criticism of the religion is more effective than simple
melodrama would have been, especially in contrast with the
historical flashbacks that reveal the doings of the tolerant
"heretic" Brendan.</p>

<p>All in all, I recommend this as a very good time for fans of
traditional SF and anyone who likes a good adventure story. Let's
hope White can give us a good many more like it.</p>
