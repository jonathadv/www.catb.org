<p>This book enwraps a first-contact novel by Stephen Leigh in two
essays by Isaac Asimov and Rudy Rucker on aliens and the first
contact problem. The obvious flaw in the result is that the whole
is less than the sum of its parts; the essays, while mildly
interesting, add nothing to the novel.</p>

<p>The subtler problem is that Leigh's aliens don't work. This is
very odd; Leigh has shown, in books like the Hoorka trilogy,
<cite>The Bones Of God</cite>, and <cite>Crystal Memory</cite>,
that he is a gifted author who can well convey the sense of wonder
and strangeness necessary to SF, and that he has a strong sense of
logical and emotive detail. But because the aliens don't work, the
plot doesn't either, and because the plot doesn't work, all the
effort put into the central characters goes for naught.</p>

<p>Why don't the aliens work? Start with one irritating biological
detail. They're avians, and like Earth birds they are supposed to
defecate casually and reflexively wherever they are, leaving their
floors and public spaces encrusted with birdshit. Now, if there is
one iron law in biology it's that organisms cannot tolerate an
environment overloaded with their own waste products (because if
they could, the waste would have been metabolized to something
useful rather than wasted).</p>

<p>Their psychology doesn't work either. We are also supposed to
believe that the avians are incapable of lying and find it almost
impossibly difficult to entertain the <em>idea</em> of a lie. And
yet, they've built spaceships. Maybe you can believe that sentients
could evolve to the point of doing experimental science without
being able to handle counterfactuals and represent them to each
other <em>as truth</em>. I can't.</p>

<p>They're also presented as caste-ridden and rule-bound to the
extent that one of lesser status will stand still to be killed by
one of higher without protest or even feeling in the matter. In
fact, late in the book one uses this as a sentience test! And yet
they are supposed to display sufficient individuality and mental
flexibility that one typical low-caste alien can grasp the human
world-view and eventually kill his own clan matriarch. Sorry, I
don't buy this either.</p>

<p>The real problem here seems to be that the story Leigh wants to
tell is How Contact with (White, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant) Humans
Corrupted The Noble Savages --- a tired myth which looks even
sillier than is its normal wont when the aliens are so obviously
contrived to be corrupted by the Innate Perfidy of (White,
Anglo-Saxon, Protestant) Human Nature.</p>

<p>One of the more persistant forms of nonsense floating around in
our culture is the idea that human beings are somehow uniquely
damned, or especially vicious or violent or deceptive relative to
other animals. Thus, we often hear that Man is the only animal that
lies/rapes/makes war/self-intoxicates, etc. etc.; and SF writers of
the more cynical variety enjoy posing human nastiness against
morally superior "innocent" aliens.</p>

<p>It doesn't take much study of animal ethology to show that all
these claims are false, and in fact they are best analyzed as
hangovers from Judeo-Christian myth. Nevertheless, even writers
much less concerned with moral and religious themes than Leigh's
past work has shown him to be often fall into dramatizing them. The
result, as in this case, is usually a regrettable mess.</p>
