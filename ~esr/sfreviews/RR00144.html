<p>I missed <cite>Queen of Angels</cite> when it first came out
because the cheapskates who float the Questar line don't kite their
paperback releases to their review list. Foo. I read it over the
1991 Worldcon, and...</p>

<p><cite>Queen of Angels</cite> is a big, ambitious, spottily
brilliant novel that doesn't quite come off. There is some
<em>marvellous</em> idea content in this baby, especially in the
parts that touch on human depth psychology and AI.</p>

<p>One throwaway passage connecting individuation with semiotic
processing struck me as so powerful and original and
thought-provoking that I had to drop the book to think about it for
twenty minutes and expect to be ruminating on it for months). This
is the kind of stimulation I read SF for. In fact, I'm going to
indulge myself and reproduce it here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The individual differentiates itself from its world and its
social group when it is able to observe all their elements as
manipulable signs. In any individual, cultured or not,
"consciousness" develops when all the portions of its mind agree on
the nature and meaning of their various "message characters." This
integration results in a persona, an "overseer" of the mental
agreement --- the conscious personality.</p>

<p>--- Martin Burke, <cite>The Country Of The Mind</cite>
(2043-2044)</p>
</blockquote>

Bear succeeds in convincing me, at a level of detail no other
author has managed, that his character Martin Burke truly
<em>u</em>nderstands the structure and development of personality
in ways as far beyond today's psychology in precision and power as
quantum physics is beyond Aristotle. I am vastly impressed by this.


<p>There is even some poetry of remarkable authenticity and power
in the book; the piece that begins "God shot up with me last night"
in chapter 26 is particularly remarkable, as is the quatrain that
begins 23.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Bear tried for too many kinds of novelty at once.
The good poetry is overbalanced by reams of turgid, babbling
<em>awful</em> poetry. His attempts at stream-of-consciousness
prose are painfully, embarrassingly bad --- masses of overelaborate
compound sentences with all the commas stripped out and a bad case
of adjectivitis. The book also has serious structural problems (too
many subplots with too few logical connections between them) and an
ending that seems both abrupt and weak.</p>

<p>Finally, there's just too much stuffed between the nova-burst
insights that seems derivative; the houngans from Gibson's
<cite>Count Zero</cite>, the mindscape sequences from Zelazny's
<cite>He Who Shapes</cite> and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Is the result Hugo-quality? On balance, I'd say no. Is it worth
a read? Most definitely. Most authors never even reach this high;
even the wreck of Bear's ambitions holds more magnificence than
most run-of-the-mill "successes".</p>
