<h1 class="c1">Raymond's Reviews #145: 1991 Novel Hugo
post-mortem</h1>

<p>1991 Novel Hugo Post-Mortem</p>

<p>Having read the fifth Hugo nominee and mostly recovered from the
fine madness that is Worldcon, I give you the Raymond's Reviews
post-mortem on the novel Hugo this year. This year's nominees were
<cite>The Vor Game</cite> (Bujold), <cite>Earth</cite> (David
Brin), <cite>The Fall of Hyperion</cite> (Dan Simmons), <cite>The
Quiet Pools</cite> (Michael P. Kube-McDowell), and <cite>Queen of
Angels</cite> (Greg Bear).</p>

<p>In <a href="RR00144.html">RR#144</a> I examined the only nominee
I hadn't previously reviewed; Bear's <cite>Queen of Angels</cite>.
Now, some reflections on how the four other nominees look at a few
months' distance; finally, a discussion of the intricate and
interesting politics that surrounded the voting this year, complete
with hot gossip from Lois Bujold's triumphal appearance at the Baen
party.</p>

<p>I raved about <cite>Earth</cite> in <a
href="RR00067.html">RR#67</a>. From a few months distance, it still
looks to me like a major, Hugo-quality work, though I'm not as
unreservedly enthusiastic about it as I was (the ending now seems
flawed and the introduction of the Gaia-mind unnecessary). I
predicted that <cite>Earth</cite> would be nominated but not win
because Brin's already had a boatload of Hugos, and this does
indeed seem to be exactly what happened. I watched Brin
congratulate Bujold at the Baen party after the Hugos.</p>

<p>I reviewed <cite>The Quiet Pools</cite> in <a
href="RR00055.html">RR#55</a>. Nothing in my judgement has changed
since then. It's still a big, thought-provoking hard-SF novel in
the traditional vein, still badly marred by the whiff of
pornography and carnography that hangs about it. Sex and violence
can be fine things when they're integral to the story, but when
they've obviously been spot-glued on to grab the bestseller crowd,
I revolt. The results have a pandering, cynical, nasty tone that
ruins the rest of the novel. I judge this the weakest of the five,
the only one I'm really surprised was nominated.</p>

<p>I micro-reviewed <cite>The Fall of Hyperion</cite> in <a
href="RR00119.html">RR#119</a>. The mega-novel formed by
<cite>Hyperion</cite> and this book is without a doubt one of the
most sweeping and impressive SF novels of the last five years. Of
this year's nominees, I think it is clearly the strongest in the
traditional "literary" sense. Had the two been issued as a unit
this year, they would have been my pick for the Hugo, edging out
<cite>Earth</cite>. As it is, I suspect the voters figured the
meganovel already got its Hugo last year when <cite>Hyperion</cite>
won.</p>

<p>I read <cite>Queen Of Angels</cite> (<a
href="RR00144.html">RR#144</a>) as a failure of breathtaking
magnificence. Idea content surpassing in scope and originality any
of the other contenders except possibly <cite>Hyperion</cite> was
vitiated by some painfully bad writing, incoherent plotting, and
obvious derivative elements. The brains of this book earned it a
nomination, but it didn't deserve to win.</p>

<p>And, finally, <cite>The Vor Game</cite> (<a
href="RR00084.html">RR#84</a>). I was there at the Baen Books party
when Lois McMaster Bujold arrived, Hugo in hand, from the award
ceremony. She was in tears with joy and everyone in sight was
literally cheering; it was a very affecting moment. I was one of
the group that stuck around and talked and celebrated with her as
pro after pro came to congratulate her with her family standing
around looking fit to burst with pride. And all this, I think,
supports the analysis that was general in conversation; that it
wasn't <cite>The Vor Game</cite> alone that won Bujold her first
novel Hugo.</p>

<p>Lois has given us a string of novels of consistent and truly
excellent quality over the last six years. From <cite>Shards Of
Honor</cite> onwards her work has won both popular and critical
acclaim, and deservedly so; she combines all the virtues of
military/adventure hard SF with a psychological depth and sympathy
rare <em>anywhere</em> in the field. <cite>The Vor Game</cite> is
no disappointment, but it's not (as she's well aware) her best to
date.</p>

<p>All present agreed that what was really going on was that the
readers just couldn't stand not to give her a novel Hugo any more,
a decision made easier because the serious competition
(<cite>Earth</cite> and <cite>Hyperion</cite>) both came from
authors who'd already been given the accolade.</p>
