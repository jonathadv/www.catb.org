<pre>
%T Red Genesis
%A S. C. Sykes
%I Bantam Spectra
%D August 1991
%O paperback, US$4.99
%P 360
%G ISBN 0-553-28874-1
</pre>

<p>This novel starts off slow, but builds up to a pretty tasty
simmer once it gets going. Graham Kuan Sinclair, multibillionaire
child of privilege, is framed for ecocide and mass murder and
exiled to the struggling colonies on the planet Mars. As he tours
the multiple cultures that have sprung up around different roles in
the work of taming the Red Planet, he begins to have a catalytic
role beyond anything his jailers have foreseen. Or is it? Because
Mars, it develops, is the ultimate sociological test-tube. And
someone is watching...</p>

<pre>
%T The Great Work of Time
%A John Crowley
%I Bantam Spectra
%D August 1991
%O paperback, US$3.99
%P 136
%G ISBN 0-553-29319-2
</pre>

<p>Why this little book won the 1990 World Fantasy Award I cannot
fathom. It's beautifully written, but incoherent, precious, and
self-consciously artsy to the point of nausea. I guess what offends
me most about it is that Crowley's "orthogonal logic" of
time-travel doesn't seem to work, and he either doesn't know or
doesn't care that it doesn't work. This is the kind of novel that
makes me want to yell "Keep SF in the gutter where it belongs!"
Highly dis-recommended.</p>

<pre>
%T Nightfall
%A Isaac Asimov
%A Robert Silverberg
%I Bantam
%D September 1991
%O paperback, US$4.99
%P 338
%G ISBN 0-553-29099-1
</pre>

<p>Asimov's classic short story <cite>Nightfall</cite> is not
improved by being spun out to novel length. Unless you're a true
completist, pass on this disappointing piece of poorly-written
puffery.</p>

<pre>
%T Red Orc's Rage
%A Phillip Jose Farmer
%I TOR
%D September
%O clothbound, US$18.95
%P 282
%G ISBN 0-312-85036-0
</pre>

<p>This novel is an odd appendix to Farmer's unfinished
<cite>Tiers</cite> books. Jim Grimson, troubled child of an abusive
father in a fictional version of our world, enters a form of
therapy modelled on actual therapeutic experiments in <em>our</em>
world in which he imagines (or astrally projects?) his way into
<em>Farmer's</em> world. Confused enough yet? Actually, it all
seems to function largely as an excuse for Farmer to give us some
early history of the series villain, Red Orc. Along the way, Farmer
cuts enough cute meta-fictional capers to make any member of the
Modern Language Association swoon with delight. What the heck, if
you're a Tiers fan buy it anyhow. In paperback.</p>
