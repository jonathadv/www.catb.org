%T Holocaust Horror
%S Mutants Amok
%V #4
%A Mark Grant 
%I Avon
%D September 1991 
%O paperback, US$2.99 
%P 196
%G 0-380-76192-0 
</pre>

<p>"Holocaust Horror" demonstrates that Mark Grant, whose leaden
pen spouted the hilariously purple phrases that kept us laughing
through Mutants Amok Numbers 1, 2, and 3 is finally learning how to
use the English language. Unfortunately, his sudden improvement in
writing style actually detracts from the reader's enjoyment.
Without the ridiculously bad language to add needed humor, his
hackneyed plot line, sexist assumptions, and gore-splattered
descriptions of carnage merely result in a trite and revolting
account of how a handful of heroes save the world from nuclear
holocaust. Do yourself a favor and give this one a miss. [CCO]</p>

%T Jokertown Shuffle (Wild Cards IX)
%A George R.R. Martin, ed.
%I Bantam 
%D September 1991
%O paperback, US$4.99
%P 390
%G 0-553-29174-2
</pre>

<p>"Jokertown Shuffle," like the other story collections set in the
Wild Cards universe, features quality writing, increasingly bizarre
joker and ace characters, drama, angst, and graphic descriptions of
exotic and gory acts of violence. A fine read for hardened Wild
Cards fans; readers with weaker stomachs or no knowledge of the
series should ease into this unsavory world by reading the earlier
collections first. [CCO]</p>

%T Sword and Sorceress VIII
%A Marion Zimmer Bradley, ed.
%I DAW
%D September 1991
%O paperback, US$4.50
%P 285
%G 0-88677-486-1
</pre>

<p>This is yet another collection by Marian Zimmer Bradley of
fantasy stories, mostly by new writers, where magic-wielding women
prevail over male oppression by means of their magic, their wits,
or both. The assortment of stories range from interesting to merely
pretentious, though I would have enjoyed them despite their flaws
had Bradley refrained from prefacing each story with cynical
commentary about how bad most of the stories of its type usually
are. [CCO]</p>
