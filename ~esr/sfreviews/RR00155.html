%A David Drake

%D October 1991
%O paperback, US$4.50
%P 228
%G ISBN 0-671-72084-8
</pre>

<p>With this book, David Drake demonstrates that he has a wider
range than low-grade military-SF carnography. The demonstration
would be more impressive if the work were less derivative, but
they're obviously pastiches in the style of Manly Wade Wellman (to
whom the book is dedicated). Still, the quality of the pastiches
isn't bad; the atmosphere and artifacts of the early American
frontier are well-evoked here. Fans of dark fantasy will enjoy the
treatment of the supernatural. And perhaps Baen deserves some
praise for floating a book that's such an odd and non-commercial
hybrid.</p>

%T Supernova
%A Roger MacBride Allen
%A Eric Kotani
%I Avon
%D October 1991
%O paperback, US$4.50
%P 345
%G ISBN 0-380-76060-6
</pre>

<p>In some ways this reminds me powerfully of <cite>Black
Sun</cite> (<a href="RR00142.html">RR#142</a>) --- another
considerably better-than-average disaster novel uplifted by good
science and featuring an astronomer as central character. This time
the nemesis isn't a solar glitch but Sirius B. No, the Earth isn't
incinerated; Sirius B isn't close enough for that. There is a
subtler danger, though --- one the authors explore rather
tellingly. Also, the depiction of life in academe is truer and more
detailed here; the characters more plausible. Decent airplane
reading.</p>

%T Jinx High
%A Mercedes Lackey
%I Tor
%D October 1991
%O paperback, US$3.99
%P 314
%G ISBN 0-812-52114-5 
</pre>

<p>This book had a bunch of strikes against it when it landed on my
desk. It's a sequel, it's packaged like a juvenile, Stephen King
liked it, and there's a nasty demon face and a pair of witchy women
on the cover. All things considered, what was inside turned out to
be much better than I expected, and I begin to understand why
Mercedes Lackey is commonly touted as one of the best of the newer
genre fantasists. The book is sort of an R-rated
technology-of-magic dark fantasy for sophisticated teenagers,
enjoyable by an adult as a light read. Diana Tregare, romance
writer and psychic investigator, visits a yuppie suburb in Oklahoma
and promptly trips over the doings of a three-hundred-year-old
sorceress who's causing strange and unwholesome manifestations at
the local high school. The plot wobbles a bit in spots and the
ending is very abrupt, but overall the mix works reasonably
well.</p>
