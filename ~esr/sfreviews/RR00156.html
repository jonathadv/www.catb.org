<pre>
%T Stranger In A Strange Land
%A Robert Heinlein
%I Ace
%D October 1991
%O trade paperback, US$9.95
%P 525
%G ISBN 0-441-78838-6
</pre>

<p>The novel that gave us the word "grok" and made RAH a hero to
the '60s counterculture suffered severe cuts on the way to press,
losing around 70,000 words from the original manuscript --- about
25% of the total, in fact. This long-awaited reissue is
<cite>Stranger</cite> as Heinlein wrote it, with the cuts restored
and some changes demanded by timid editors reversed. The result has
substantially better continuity than the rather choppy and
occasionally frenetic-seeming cut version. The sexual content is
more honest and explicit, though still quite tame by modern
standards. It must be said that some of the talking-heads scenes
are perhaps too long, too discursive now; and, paradoxically, some
of the added detail dates the book more firmly. But on balance, the
restorations seem a very good thing. All Heinlein fans, and anyone
who was either delighted or upset by the cut version, ought to get
acquainted with this one.</p>

%T Consider Phlebas
%A Iain M. Banks
%I Bantam
%D October 1991
%O paperback, US$5.99
%P 497
%G ISBN 0-553-29281-1
</pre>

<p>If, like me, you consider big-screen space-opera one of life's
enduring comforts, you'll want a copy of this book. It gives you a
ringside seat on the Culture-Idiran war, through the eyes of a
shape-shifting agent of the Idirans assigned to recover a downed
Culture battle computer. Even after you figure out that Bora Horza
Gorbuchul is working for the bad guys, you'll love the scenery --
the thousand-mile-long worldships of Vavatch Orbital, the tunnels
of Schar's World, the jungle planet of Marjoin and its Temple of
Light. And there's action aplenty as well; space battles, intrigue,
treachery, mystery, and world-engulfing cataclysm. The author even
thoughtfully includes an appendix giving a brief history of What
Happened After. Great fun, and recommended.</p>

<pre>
%T Slow Freight
%A F. M. Busby
%I Bantam Spectra
%D October 1991
%O paperback, US$3.99
%P 311
%G ISBN 0-553-29110-6
</pre>

<p>This book plays some interesting games with a genuinely novel
premise -- a teleportation method that costs you a constant two
years per transit. And the method involves hyperspatial links that
can seriously screw up passing alien starships, and thereby hangs a
tale. Busby's house specialty in "the long view", the odd effects
of relativistic travel, is fully on display here. It's too bad so
much of the wordage is taken up by a mess of human power games and
largely pointless sexual intrigues, but if you like your SF hard
you probably want this book anyway.</p>
