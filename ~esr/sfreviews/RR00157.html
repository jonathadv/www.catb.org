<pre>
%T Radius of Doubt
%S The Patterns of Chaos
%V #1
%A Charles Ingrid
%I DAW
%D October 1991
%O paperback, US$3.50
%P 348
%G ISBN 0-88677-491-8
</pre>

<p>With this book, the author of the execrable <cite>Sand
Wars</cite> series launches yet another wretched saga of
space-operatic thud-and-blunder. Palaton, the protagonist, is a
psychic star-pilot from a race of rather obvious cat-men. Naturally
the politics of his homeworld is being manipulated by evil
lizard-men as the Imperial house slides into decadence (don't you
hate it when that happens?). And -- gasp -- he's Losing his Powers,
seemingly doomed to end up just another burned-out starsailor left
Purposeless in the Prime of Life. There's hardly a shred of
originality in this mess anywhere and the writing is strictly hack
city, the slum district at that. Avoid!</p>

<pre>
%T Python Isle
%S Doc Savage
%A Kenneth Robeson
%I Bantam Falcon
%D October 1991
%O paperback, US$4.50
%P 207
%G ISBN 0-533-29357-5
</pre>

<p>Yet another modern pastiche of one of the pulps' most successful
and long-running series. This one lacks the originality and campy
charm of Farmer's <cite>Escape From Loki</cite> (<a
href="RR00146.html">RR#146</a>), however, so you'd best give it a
miss unless you're already a fan of the series or have a technical
antiquarian interest in the material.</p>

<pre>
%T Grandmaster's Choice
%E Andre Norton
%I TOR
%D October 1991
%O paperback, US$
%P 354
%G ISBN 0-812-50619-7
</pre>

<p>Yet another author's-choice anthology. As usual, it contains a
bunch of first-class stories, all previously anthologized and all
quite familiar to the serious fan. A reasonable introduction to
classic SF for the curious.</p>

<pre>
%T The Time Patrol
%A Poul Anderson
%I TOR
%D October 1991
%O clothbound, US$21.95
%P 458
%G ISBN 0-312-85231-2
</pre>

<p>This book collects all of Poul Anderson's classic "Time Patrol"
stories except the full-length novel <cite>The Shield of
Time</cite> in one volume, plus one new one. If you know your SF,
that's all the recommendation you need. If you don't, it should be.
Enjoy!</p>
