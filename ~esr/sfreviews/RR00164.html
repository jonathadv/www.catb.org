%T Mercedes Lackey
%A Winds of Fate
%S The Mage Winds
%V 1
%I DAW
%D November 1991
%O paperback, US$
%P 387
%G ISBN 0-88677-489-6
</pre>

<p>In a review of <cite>Jinx High</cite> (<a
href="RR00155.html">RR#155</a>) I observed that Mercedes Lackey had
done something much more pleasant with what looked like a pile of
cliches than I'd been expecting. <cite>Winds Of Fate</cite> has a
similar quality. Lackey's tale of the competent but repressed
princess Elspeth in a kingdom defended by wards of magic that are
slowly failing says and does all the right things to hold her
intended audience, and does them with more grace and less audible
grinding of plot machinery than most writers in this genre can
manage. If the result is finally less interesting than <cite>Jinx
High</cite>, perhaps it's because Lackey in this book has accepted
the constraints of genre formulas that <cite>Jinx High</cite> was
positioned to bust a little. Ultimately, this is just another
plucky-princess-off-to-save-the-world-and-find-romance book. And
that's a shame, because it convinces me that Lackey is capable of
more interesting things.</p>

<pre>
%T Conan the Rogue
%A John Maddox Roberts
%I TOR
%D November 1992
%O paperback, US$9.50
%P 304
%G ISBN 0-812-51411-4
</pre>

<p>Most of the latter-day Conan pastiches are deadful, but
<em>this</em> one is hilarious. Roberts gives us a sort of
Hyborian-age remake of <cite>The Maltese Falcon</cite>, with Conan
as Sam Spade. All the other characters show up in fairly thin
disguises; the author's version of Casper Gutman is particularly
funny. I'm <em>keeping</em> this one.</p>

<pre>
%T Shadow's Daughter
%A Shirley Meier
%I Baen
%D November 1991
%O paperback, US$4.99
%P 323
%G ISBN 0-671-72096-1
</pre>

<p>Another fine novel of the Fifth Millenium by Shirley Meier, half
of the team that gave us <cite>The Cage</cite> (<a
href="RR00003.html">RR#3</a>). This is the story of Megan
Whitlock's childhood on the streets of F'talezon. We follow an
ordinary little girl through the trials that forge her into a woman
--- the woman who will one day triumph over pirates, slavers and
treachery to become one of the great trading princes of the wild
Brahvniki River and change the destiny of nations. It ends years
before <cite>The Cage</cite>; this gap will be filled by the
upcoming reissue of <cite>The Sharpest Edge</cite>. Recommended to
all fans of these books so far, and that includes me.</p>
