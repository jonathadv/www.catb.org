<p>Just as the human sex drive motivates both a genre of art
(called erotica) and reams of mindless trash we call `pornography',
the human fondness for vicarious violence gives rise to some high
art and a vast wasteland of garbage that's been called
`carnography'.</p>

<p>Most carnography (like most pornography) is pretty silly one you
get past the hook. But (again like pornography) it can provide a
useful catharsis for healthy individuals, the species has survived
thousands of years of continuous employment of the stuff, and one
is justified in looking with deep suspicion at the motives and
agendas of people who call for it to be suppressed.</p>

<p>It's never been difficult for me to be libertarian about
pornography, because the notion that pictures of people getting it
on could somehow warp other peoples' brains seemed so transparently
ludicrous. As well censor pictures of people <em>eating</em>...</p>

<p>Carnography's different, though. There's actually substantial
evidence that vicarious violence can desensitize people to the real
stuff. Nevertheless, my belief in everyone's right to go to hell in
their own way is sufficiently strong that I oppose censorship of
this stuff, too.</p>

<p>Every once in a while, though, I run across an example of
carnography so repellent, so unredeemed by any spark of idea
content, so...<em>evil</em> that I'm tempted to abandon my
convictions just this once. <cite>The Quick</cite> is just such a
novel.</p>

<p>The protagonist --- the person we're encouraged to
<em>identify</em> with, mind you --- is a stone sociopath who kills
and guts his victims for fun. His casual, amoral manipulation and
destruction of everyone around him is simply wallowed in for most
of the novel, and then tossed off via some weak mysticism appealing
finally to that ultimate philosophical cop-out, solipsism.</p>

<p>And that's basically all there is to this book; ugliness,
ugliness, and more ugliness, leading up to a denouement so bleak
and stomach-turning that even most nihilists would pale and avert
their eyes.</p>

<p>Not only should you not buy this book, you should tell your
friends not to buy it. I devoutly hope the author will sink back
into his hole and never be heard from again.</p>
