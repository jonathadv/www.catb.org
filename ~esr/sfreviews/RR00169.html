<pre>
%T Earthgrip: Tales from the Trader's World
%A Harry Turtledove
%I Ballantine/Del Rey
%D December 1991
%O paperback, US$
%P 264
%G ISBN 0-345-37239-5
</pre>

<p>This fix-up novel collects all of Harry's "Trader" stories from
<cite>Analog</cite> in one volume. They center on Jennifer Logan, a
future academic who studies the English of our time with a
specialty in early speculative fiction. That's right, she's an SF
specialist -- which comes in handy when she takes a bear on an
exploration and trading vessel venturing into the far reaches of
the galactic beyond. Turtledove has a lot of fun with this frame,
including numerous sly references and anagrammatic gotchas for the
serious fan. The whole is supported by his usual quiet
craftsmanship, so you'll have fun, too. Recommended.</p>

%T The Crafters
%A Christopher Stasheff &amp; Bill Fawcett, eds.
%I Ace 
%D December 1991
%O paperback, US$4.50
%P 246
%G 0-441-12130-6
</pre>

<p>Back in seventeenth-century Salem, alchemist Amer Crafter and a
witch named Samona cheat Death, fall in love, and marry. The fruit
of this unlikely union is a line of magic-using descendants -- and
ten upbeat, competently written stories by established fantasy
authors tracing their influence upon history through the
generations. Something (possibly the slogan "The Bewitching New
Series!" gracing the cover in prominent white letters) tells me
that this fundamentally light-hearted volume is destined to spawn a
new shared-world series. [CCO]</p>

<pre>
%T Servant of the Empire
%A Raymond E. Feist and Janny Wurts
%I Bantam
%D December 1991
%O paperback, 691 pp, US$5.99
%G 0-553-29245-5
</pre>

<p>Do you remember Tekumel, the exotic world that was the playing
ground in the game "Empire of the Petal Throne"? The Tsurani empire
Feist and Wurts depict in "Servant of the Empire" feels a lot like
Tekumel (it even includes a sentient insect species resembling the
Pe Choi). But Feist and Wurts choose to focus, not on demons and
sorcerors, but on one Ruling Lady, of a minor house, whose courage,
wit, and willingness to listen to strange barbarian ideas enable
her to unravel the web of intrigues against her. If you love to
lose yourself in tales of exotic, quasi-Oriental empires, you'd
find "Servant" marvelous airplane reading. [CCO]</p>
