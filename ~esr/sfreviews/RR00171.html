%T The Jekyll Legacy
%A Robert Bloch and Andre Norton
%I Tor
%D December 1991
%O paperback, 248 pp, US$4.99
%G 0-812-51583-8
</pre>

<p>Bloch and Norton have done an audacious thing -- they have
written a full-length sequel to R.L. Stevenson's classic tale of
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Surprisingly, it works rather well. They
have succeeded not only in evoking the atmosphere of Victorian
London, but in imitating the moral tone of Stevenson's story,
reminding the reader how closely all of us coexist with evil. If
the fruit of their efforts seems a bit tame and bloodless, that's
not necessarily a fault. We have all become accustomed to reading
graphic stories of crimes even more horrible than Hyde's since
Stevenson first put pen to paper. [CCO]</p>

%T Cloven Hooves
%A Megan Lindholm
%I Bantam
%D December 1991
%O paperback, 360 pp, US$4.99
%G 0-553-29327-3
</pre>

<p>"Cloven Hooves" is a fantasy (sf?) tale with the feel of a
<em>serious</em> mainstream novel. The protagonist is an
independent-minded, tomboyish woman with a young son and an ailing
marriage. After a long period of fruitlessly striving to make her
life work, she walks away from civilization to mate with, and bear
a child to, a satyr; a half-goat, half-man creature. Despite its
wildly implausible biological assumptions (e.g., that satyrs can
only reproduce by mating with human women), Lindholm's tale is
oddly convincing and genuinely moving. Unfortunately, it's probably
too weird for most buyers of mainstream fiction, and much too tame
and predictable for sf or fantasy fans. [CCO]</p>

<pre>
%T Bicycling Through Space and Time
%A Mike Sirotta
%I Ace
%D December 1991
%O paperback, US$$3.99
%P 202
%G ISBN 0-441-05735-7
</pre>

<p>The author of this book is obviously a bicycling enthusiast.
Also, rather obviously, he wants to be Douglas Adams when he grows
up. Unfortunately, this tale of a hack fantasy writer who acquires
a souped-up alien bicycle and the keys to the Bike Path Between The
Universes is basically a one-joke affair, and palls quite a bit
before it ends. Slight, trite, and not very bright; give it a
miss.</p>
