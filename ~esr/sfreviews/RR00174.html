<pre>
%T Kill Station
%S Space Cops
%V Book 1
%A Diane Duane
%A Peter Morwood
%I Avon Nova
%D January 1992
%O paperback, US$3.99

<p>As with the one previous Space Cops adventure, <cite>Mind
Blast</cite> (<a href="RR00129.html">RR#129</a>), this book isn't
the dead loss the hackneyed series concept ought to make it.
Glyndower and O'Bannion are chasing a run of suspicious
disappearances in the far asteroid belt this time; it leads them to
a ring of (what else?) space pirates. Sure the plotting is
contrived, but the writing's a lot better than usual for this sort
of thing. If the publisher's packaging weren't so relentlessly
tacky ("Elite champions of justice in a lawless galactic frontier")
I could almost like this series...</p>

<pre>
%T Alien Blues
%A Lynn S. Hightower
%I Ace
%D January 1992
%O paperback, US$4.50
%P 251
%G ISBN 0-441-64460-0
</pre>

<p>This attempt at a blend of SF with the Ed McBain-style police
procedural doesn't quite come off -- too many things in the
protagonist's world are obviously set up for plot convenience,
without much attention to their implications for other aspects of
the background. As one example critical to the plot, we're expected
to believe the visiting alien Elaki have learned enough human
neurochemistry to produce cures for all manner of mental illnesses,
but that there's still a drug-addiction problem. In general, the
future shows none of the radical differences from here-and-now that
its technological level certainly ought to imply. And nothing else
about this book is remarkable enough to make these problems worth
ignoring. Give it a miss and wish the author better craft next
time.</p>

<pre>
%T Operation Chaos
%A Poul Anderson
%I Baen
%D January 1992
%O paperback, US$
%P 282
%G ISBN 0-671-72102-X
</pre>

<p>Baen continues its praiseworthy program of putting out handsome
reprints of oldies-but-goodies. This fixup novel by Poul Anderson
was originally a series of novellettes and novellas written between
1955 and 1970, but has become a minor classic of `hard fantasy' ---
the <cite>Unknown Worlds</cite> tradition of `technology-of-magic'
stories like Heinlein's <cite>Magic, Inc.</cite> and the
Pratt/DeCamp <cite>Incomplete Enchanter</cite> stories. If you
haven't read this one, you've a treat in store; enjoy the
adventures of Steve and Virginia Matuchek as they contend with
various esoteric evildoers. The climactic final episode, in which
they harrow Hell itself to rescue their daughter and encounter a
towering evil from <em>our</em> history, still yields some of the
most eerie and gripping moments in modern fantasy.</p>
