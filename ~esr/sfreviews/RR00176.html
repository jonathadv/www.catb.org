<h1 class="c1">Raymond's Reviews #176</h1>

<pre>
%T The Missing Matter
%A Thomas R. McDonough
%A Wallace H. Tucker
%I Bantam Spectra
%D January 1991
%O paperback, US$4.99
%P 358
%G ISBN 0-553-29364-8
</pre>

<p>Another package deal from Byron Preiss, this one (#3) somewhere
between the intriguing #1 (<cite>Red Genesis</cite>) and the
execrable #2 (<cite>Alien Tongue</cite>, <a
href="RR00143.html">RR#143</a>) in quality. McDonough gives us a
competent but poorly-charactered tale of travel between parallel
worlds on the "wandering world" Ronin, complete with bug-eyed
monsters. It's not as good as his <cite>The Architects Of
Hyperspace</cite>; one suspects it might have been a failed first
novel pulled out of the trunk. Wallace Tucker's essay on the "dark
matter" problem in cosmology is only loosely connected to the
novel, but worth the paperback price in itself.</p>

<pre>
%T TekLords
%A William Shatner
%I Ace
%D January, 1991
%O paperback, US$4.99
%P 293
%G ISBN 0-441-80010-6
</pre>

<p>The amazing thing about <cite>TekWar</cite> (<a
href="RR00079.html">RR#79</a>) was that it worked at all. Now it
turns out that Shatner can't write much better than he can act;
these books were ghosted by Ron Goulart. In this one the novelty's
worn off and all we've got is a routine jaunt through cop-novel
cliches and a bunch of Goulart's camp-erratic robots. T.J. Hooker
on Murdstone. No thanks.</p>

<pre>
%T The Sapphire Rose
%S The Elenium
%V Book Three
%A David Eddings
%I Del Rey
%D January 1992
%O clothbound, US$22.00
%P 467
%G ISBN 0-345-37474-6
</pre>

<p>Though I greatly enjoyed <cite>The Belgariad</cite>, I've had a
pretty low opinion of Eddings since the beginning of the
<cite>Malloreon</cite> books, one which the first two books of
<cite>The Elenium</cite> did little to raise. Honesty compels me to
admit that this third volume is significantly better, and I think I
now understand the pattern of variation in Eddings's work. He's
quite good at character and dialogue, especially when he plays
ironically with the conventions of the fantasy form. But he's poor
at world-building, action, and the sorts of things one has to do
well to make traditional epic fantasy come off. Thus, the intrigues
and romantic scenes and church politics this book is dominated by
work well; the epic confrontation scenes work much less well, and
the battle sequences and everyday-life scenes don't work at all.
Caveat reader.</p>
