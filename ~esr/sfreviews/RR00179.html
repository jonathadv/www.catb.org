<p>Move over, Craig Shaw Gardner. Terry Pratchett, look behind you.
This book, third of a trilogy or not, is Esther Friesner's funniest
yet and the sharpest-eyed fantasy farce to come down the pike since
Pratchett's early Discworld novels. From the opening sequence (the
Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse as a failing garage-rock band)
onward, this tale of hapless college freshman Tim Desmond and the
magical entities that complicate his life is fast-paced, hilarious,
and wickedly intelligent. The demolition of cutesy kiddie fantasy
during the Underworld sequences is worth the price of admission by
itself. Highly recommended.</p>

<p>Here's an unusual book -- a sequel set on a Darkover-oid world
that's good enough to make me want to find the prequel, <cite>Gate
Of Ivory</cite>. What would otherwise be fairly humdrum adventure
and intrigue is lifted a bit out of the ruck by the directness,
humor, and occasional wry wisdom of the first-person narrative
voice. A fun read-once.</p>

<p>In my review of John Blair's first novel, <cite>A Landscape of
Darkness</cite> (<a href="RR00077.html">RR#77</a>), I expressed the
hope that he'd find something more original to write about.
Unfortunately, he seems preoccupied with inscrutable godlike
aliens. <cite>Bright Angel</cite> seems to want to be a
psychological study of human reactions to the Totally Other, but it
stumbles over the same problem most such stories do --- where
there's no contact, there's no story, just an unfocused series of
vignettes in which the human characters can only react rather than
acting. The results here are disappointing.</p>
