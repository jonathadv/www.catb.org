<h1 class="c1">Raymond's Reviews #182</h1>

<pre>
%T Black Steel
%A Steve Perry
%I Ace
%D February 1991
%O paperback, US$4.50
%P 244
%G ISBN 0-441-06698-4
</pre>

<p>In this additional followup to the <cite>Matador</cite> books
(see <a href="RR00005.html">RR#5</a>) Sleel, ace matador and hero
of the Revolution, finally grows up. After losing a client, he
becomes entangled in a centuries-old vendetta between rival
families of swordmasters. This is a much better book than the
author's listless last novel <cite>The Albino Knife</cite> (<a
href="RR#00131.html">RR#131</a>), and proves once again that Perry
at the top of his form is better than anyone else at blending SF
with martial-arts mysticism. If you must read carno, at least this
is the best stuff going.</p>

<pre>
%T Phule's Paradise
%A Robert Lynn Asprin
%I Ace
%D February 1992
%O paperback, US$4.99
%P 252
%G ISBN 0-441-66253-6
</pre>

<p>This sequel to <cite>Phule's Company</cite> (<a
href="RR00076.html">RR#076</a>) is more of the same --- light,
fluffy, mindless, fun for Asprin's fans from the Skeeve books and
probably a stone bore for anyone else. You Have Been Warned.</p>

<pre>
%T The Emperor of Everything
%S The Emanicipator
%V Book II
%A Ray Aldridge
%I Bantam
%D February 1992
%O paperback, US$4.50
%P 278
%G ISBN 0-553-29491-1
</pre>

<p>I said of volume 1: "This is glitter-trash formula SF
reminiscent of Christopher Rowley --- the hero is an assassin
working for (but secretly against) the galactic slavers' guild.
Lots of sex, violence, perversion, decadence, grotesquerie, and
picturesque villains. Inventive, though, and better written than
such stuff usually is. You might enjoy it." All the above still
applies.</p>

<pre>
%T The Difference Engine
%A William Gibson
%A Bruce Sterling
%I Bantam
%D February 1992
%O paperback, US$5.99
%P 429
%G ISBN 0-553-29461-X
</pre>

<p>In this bizarre and marvelous book, Gibson &amp; Stirling give
us a Victorian techno-thriller, an alternate-history speculation
worked out in a depth that recalls Heinlein's future history. What
if Charles Babbage had succeeded in building his mechanical
computer in the 1830s? What would have been the consequences of an
Information Revolution before electronics, a first Computer Age a
century early? Never mind the technical and engineering bobbles in
this book; the audacity of the premise and the cleverness with
which the authors weave historical characters and events into a
tapestry of might-have-been more than saves it. Highly
recommended.</p>
