<pre>
%T Give Me Liberty
%A Frank Miller
%A Dave Gibbons
%I Dell
%D January 1992
%O paperback, US$20.00
%G ISBN 0-440-50466-5
</pre>

<p>This graphic novel is a brutal, cynical, graphically gory
near-future thriller. The viewpoint character is Martha Washington,
1 21st-century black slum kid who joins the Peace Force and becomes
entangled in high politics. The storyline is melodramatic and
cliched, the continuity poor, and the worldbuilding shoddy --- but
the art isn't bad, and the whole is relieved by occasional touches
of black humor. Overall, I didn't like it, but I can see that a
comics fan might.</p>

<pre>
%T The Green Millennium
%A Fritz Leiber
%I Collier Books
%D 1992
%O paperback, US$4.95
%P 219
%G ISBN 0-02-022346-3
</pre>

<p>Here's a classy reprint of Fritz Leiber's madcap 1953 farce
about a most unusual sort of alien invasion. Phil Gish is the
archetypal nebbish until the day Lucky the green cat wanders into
his life. To get him back, he tangles with an assortment of thugs,
religious fanatics, scientists, mobsters, mysterious satyr-people,
and the Federal Bureau of Loyalty. Many details of the 2003 Lieber
projected in 1953 ring eerily true in 1992. Recommended.</p>

<pre>
%T The Yngling and the Circle of Power
%A John Dalmas
%I Baen
%D February 1992
%O paperback, US$4.99
%P 360
%G ISBN 0-671-72106-2
</pre>

<p>I've commented before on John Dalmas's fascination with the
warrior-mystic (<a href="RR00010.html">RR#10</a>, <a
href="RR00066.html">RR#66</a>); most of what I said in <a
href="RR00010.html">RR#10</a> applies here. The first in this
series, <cite>The Yngling</cite>, was interesting; the second
(<cite>Homecoming</cite>) was entertaining; this third is mostly
boring. Nils Jarnhann resigns as law-speaker of the Neovikings to
wander east and tangle with Mongols and yetis and Tibetan mystics.
As usual, the results are a weird mix of carnography and New-Age
psychobabble. Yawn.</p>

<p>RECEIVED BUT NOT REVIEWED: <cite>Spartacus</cite> by T. L.
Mancour (Pocket). Random trekfic.</p>

<p><cite>Crystal World</cite> by Isidore Haiblum. Poor-looking
sequel to a wretched prequel (<cite>Specterworld</cite>, <a
href="RR00133.html">RR#133</a>).</p>

<p><cite>Mutant Star</cite> by Karen Haber (Bantam). Sequel to an
original I loathed.</p>

<p><cite>The Avenger</cite> by Louise Cooper (Bantam) Book III of
YA quest fantasy.</p>

<p><cite>The Caspak novels</cite> by Edgar Rice Burroughs (Del
Rey). Three volumes: <cite>The Land That Time Forgot</cite>,
<cite>The People That Time Forgot</cite>, <cite>Out Of Time's
Abyss</cite>. ERB at his cheesiest. Of antiquarian interest only.
<cite>The Dragon Token</cite> by Melanie Rawn (DAW).</p>

<p><cite>Blood Trail</cite> by Tanya Huff (DAW)</p>
