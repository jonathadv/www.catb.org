<h1 class="c1">Raymond's Reviews #186</h1>

<p>Finishing off the February 1992 releases and starting on
March...</p>

<pre>
%T The Deed of Paksenarrion
%A Elizabeth Moon
%I Baen
%D February 1992
%O trade paperback, US$12.00
%P 1024
%G ISBN 0-671-72104-6
</pre>

<p>This is first for Baen --- a big, handsome <em>trade</em>
paperback reprint of one of the more successful fantasy trilogies
of the last five years. If you like fantasy and you missed
<cite>Sheepfarmer's Daughter</cite>, <cite>Divided
Allegiance</cite> and <cite>Oath Of Gold</cite> first time around,
do yourself a favor and pick up this edition. You'll enjoy it.</p>

<pre>
%T In the Hall of the Dragon King
%A Stephen R. Lawhead
%I Avon
%D March 1992
%O paperback, 370 pp, US$4.99
%G ISBN 0-380-71629-1
</pre>

<p>Unless you're a really hard-core fantasy junkie, who
compulsively reads every sword-and-sorcery novel published, avoid
<cite>In the Hall of the Dragon King</cite>, the first book of
Stephen Lawhead's new series. To anyone but a fantasy-fanatic,
there is nothing of interest here; the plot is standard, and every
page is crammed with hordes of cliches rising to overcome the
reader like the zombified warriors his necromancer villain sends
against the protagonists. Cliched language, abounding in leaden
phrases such as "the tattered remains of their once-proud armies,"
help make what would merely be a boring novel nearly unreadable.

<pre>
%T Cybernetic Jungle
%A S. N. Lewitt
%I Ace
%D March 1992
%O paperback, US$4.50
%P 262
%G ISBN 0-441-02257-X
</pre>

<p>The rather bleak and predictable plot of this book isn't quite
rescued by the unusual cultural milieu in which it's set (the slums
of a future Brasilia). The samba music and capoeira references
aside, the whole is too much like her last outing, <cite>Blind
Justice</cite> (<a href="RR#00120.html">RR#120</a>). A
streetfighter and a disaffected child of privilege fall in
something like love one Carnival night and conspire to spike the
plutocrats' guns. The rest is boring.</p>

<pre>
%T Crusade
%A David Weber
%A Steve White
%I Baen
%D March 1992
%O paperback, US$4.99
%P 426
%G ISBN 0-671-72111-9
</pre>

<p>The author of <cite>Mutineer's Moon</cite> (<a
href="RR00154.html">RR#154</a>) utters yet another grand galumphing
space-opera. This is the kind of book for which describing the plot
and characters is silly; they're just excuses to frame lots of
gaudy space-battle scenes and hardware blowing up in all
directions. If you like that sort of thing (as I for one do),
you'll enjoy this. If not, avoid this book as you would the
plague.</p>
