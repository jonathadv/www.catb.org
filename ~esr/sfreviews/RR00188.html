<pre>
%T Born to Run
%A Mercedes Lackey
%A Larry Dixon
%I Baen
%D March 1992
%O paperback, US$4.99
%P 317
%G ISBN 0-671-72110-0
</pre>

<p>If your idea of a good time combines elves, rock music, muscle
cars, and a socially-conscious subtext about the troubles of
teenage runaways, this is the book for you. Lackey returns to the
world of <cite>A Knight of Ghosts and Shadows</cite> (<a
href="RR00077.html">RR#77</a>) but with a different locale and
characters. The viewpoint character is Tannim, a human mage who
tools a souped-up Mustang Mach 1 around the streets of Savannah,
Georgia. He's involved in the war between the Seleighe and
Unseleighe courts of Elvenkind, and his life gets still more
complicated when he befriends a runaway who's drifting towards a
kiddie-porn ring run by the latter. Action galore ensues.
Lightweight, but a fun read.</p>

<pre>
%T A Maze of Stars
%A John Brunner
%I DelRey
%D March 1992
%O paperback, US$4.99
%P 326
%G ISBN 0-345-37554-8
</pre>

<p>The viewpoint character of this grim think-piece is a gigantic
starship, programmed to wander through space and time monitoring
the histories of the six hundred and seventy worlds it seeded in
the Arm of Stars. As it ponders the glories and horrors the
diverging colonies have created and interacts with the few outcasts
prermitted to know of its existence, it becomes increasingly
obsessed with discovering the source of the peculiar compulsions
under which it labors. As usual for JKB's work, there's plenty
that's original and thought-provoking in this mix. But the
atmosphere of the whole is bitter, gray and sad. The propulsive
energy of much of his earlier work is missing. Brunner at the top
of his form is one of the field's best writers; I hope he can find
it again.</p>

<pre>
%T Suisan
%A Phyllis Carol Agins
%I Baen
%D March 1992
%O paperback, US$4.99
%P 241
%G ISBN 0-671-72112-7
</pre>

<p>This slender tale is a retelling of the "Snow White myth in
which the sexual feelings of the characters -- especially the
dwarves -- are openly but sensitively handled. Unfortunately,
Agins's use of modern (Jungian) psychology is the only unusual
twist in an otherwise unoriginal, clumsily written novel. However,
the beauty of Agins's imagery, which shines despite the awkward
writing, lifts this work above the rest of the slush pile and
suggests that she may eventually write memorable fantasy.</p>

<p>RECEIVED BUT NOT REVIEWED:</p>

<p><cite>The Druid Of Shannara</cite> by Terry Brooks (DelRey).
Lives down to the vomitous expectations established by its
prequels.</p>

<p><cite>The Faithful Traitor</cite> by Robert Don Hughes (DelRey).
YA fantasy sequel to a prequel I never saw.</p>

<p><cite>The Squares Of The City</cite> by John Brunner (Collier).
Classy reissue of a minor classic.</p>
