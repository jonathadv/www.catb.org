<pre>
%T Meri
%A Maya Kaathryn Bohnhoff
%I Baen
%D April 1992
%O paperback, 268 pp, US$4.99
%G ISBN 0-671-72115-1
</pre>

<p>"Meri" is a charming, Welsh-flavored fantasy about the struggles
of a young girl who is striving to become her community's first
female Osraed--a kind of magic-using Druid. Although the
experienced fantasy reader will be able to predict the outcome of
all the plot complications and riddles many pages (or chapters)
away, the main characters are very likeable, and it's not
unpleasant to follow their lives for a scant 268 pages, even if you
have already guessed the outcome. [CCO]</p>

%T Sheltered Lives
%A Charles Oberndorf
%I Bantam/Spectra
%D March 1992
%O paperback, 450 pp, US$4.99
%G ISBN 0-553-29248-X
</pre>

<p>Oberndorf's near-future America fights crime with 24- hour
monitoring of (most) citizens. It fights the spread of AIDS by
sending infected persons to concentration camps while providing
government-trained prostitutes for the healthy. Fertile ground for
ethical speculation about important social issues? Maybe, but
Oberndorf doesn't play it that way. What he gives us is a
prosaically-drawn thriller set in an America that would have
shocked George Orwell. In best modern novelist fashion, Oberndorf
even refuses to wrap up most of the plot twists, leaving the reader
to speculate about how protagonist, "servicer" Rod Lawrence, can
pick up the remains of his shattered life. Fascinating reading for
those who don't detest stories that lack a definite ending.

%T The Remarkables
%A Robert Reed
%I Bantam Spectra
%D March 1992
%O paperback, US$4.99
%P 344
%G ISBN 0-553-29362-1
</pre>

<p>The author of <cite>Down The Bright Way</cite> (<a
href="RR00199.html">RR#199</a>) delivers a solid, well-textured
novel of wilderness adventure in an alien ecology. As in the
classic stories of this type, the mutual strangers on a trek across
the wilderness of Pitcairn have secrets which explode into shocking
relevance as the quest isolates them from civilization. The really
fun thing about this novel is how carefully Reed confounds all
one's expectations about the interactions between the human
Pitcairns and their treelike alien symbionts, and the nature of the
aliens themselves. The result is perhaps a tad too overwritten and
introspective for its own good, but displays a fine strong SF
talent from which we can expect more original work.</p>
