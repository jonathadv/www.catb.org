<p>The best thing about "Phoenix Fire" is the basic plot concept;
the resumption of an age-old struggle between an Earth-demon and a
Phoenix. This demon, which was buried beneath a clay seal (and
guarded by the famous Ch'in dynasty army of lifesize terra-cotta
soldier statues), escapes during an archeological dig and tunnels
its way to California, where its old nemesis is struggling out of
the La Brea tar pits.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Forrest does not have the authorial skills to
make a coherent novel out of this idea. Her first problem is the
English language itself. Some of her complex sentences rival
entries in the Bulwer-Lytton bad writing contest. Consider the
following snippets of deathless prose:</p>

<p>"Victor wore his hair in a conservative pompadour, combed his
eyebrows upward as if they were luxurious caterpillars, conspicuous
in an ethnic face which was normally devoid of much facial hair,
and liked to sing to his dinner crowd." (p. 46)</p>

<p>"It was cloyingly hot, and yellow light streamed in patchily
through the old, drawn blinds which had been crisped by years of
summer heat and could no longer withstand it." (p. 169)</p>

<p>"One could believe in hell, she thought, and this is heaven
singing its warning." (p. 333)</p>

<p>Forrest does a little better by her characters, which one might
expect to be made of cardboard. They're one step above that;
they're stock figures from California-esque soap opera. They
include a gay Hispanic interior decorator, an executive recovering
from open heart surgery who's tired of the rat race, and an elderly
Holocaust survivor. Because the reader is familiar with these
characters, Forrest has little to do to make them seem plausible
and natural, and that little she does rather well.</p>

<p>The worst disappointment is reserved for those folks brave
enough to ignore Forrest's flaws and plow on with the story. After
taking over 300 pages to arrange the confrontation of demon and
phoenix, Forrest not only refuses to show us its outcome, but has
the effrontery to have her characters react as though this
collision of supernatural forces was not even important. The effect
of this unexpected letdown is to make the novel seem, in
retrospect, shallow and trivial.</p>

<p>I don't place all the blame on Elizabeth Forrest for the failure
of "Phoenix Fire." I think DAW is also to blame for buying her
novel (presumably on the strength of its concept alone) and failing
to give her the editorial assistance necessary to refine it into a
story worth reading. I will think twice in future about spending my
time on any book bearing DAW's logo. [CCO]</p>
