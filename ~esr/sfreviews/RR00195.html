<pre>
%T Northworld Justice
%A David Drake
%I Ace
%D April 1992
%O paperback, US$4.99
%P 282
%G ISBN 0-441-58616-3
</pre>

<p>In <cite>Cross The Stars</cite> (<a
href="RR00176.html">RR#176</a>) David Drake rather clumsily
strip-mined Homer's <cite>Odyssey</cite>. This is the third volume
of a series that does a similarly ham-fisted job of pastiching
Norse myth. The results are gruesome, carnographic and ultimately
rather pointless. On top of that, though the cover screams "The
Final Battle Of The Ultimate War", the ending is an obvious setup
for yet another sequel. Avoid.</p>

<pre>
%T Castle Dreams
%A John DeChancie
%I Ace
%D April 1992
%O paperback, US$5.99
%P 228
%G ISBN 0-441-09414-7
</pre>

<p>The author of this book observes in a footnote that this novel
may be too clever for its own good. This is true, but it's
nevertheless an improvement on the last couple "Castle" books,
which were boring. The plot is fairly routine huggery-muggery among
the 144,000 alternate worlds accessible through the Castle's
portals; the real fun here is in DeChancie's sendups of various
SFnal and fantasy tropes and his skewering of postmodernist cliche.
Warning: it won't make much sense unless you've actually read at
least some of the previous books.</p>

<pre>
%T Greenmagic
%A Crawford Kilian
%I Del Rey
%D April 1992
%O paperback, US$
%P 311
%G ISBN 0-345-36140
</pre>

<p>The bad news is that this is yet another
outcast-mage-saves-the-world fantasy. The good news is that it's
more tightly written, better-crafted and shows just a little more
psychological sophistication than most of its type (some may
consider this assessment to damn with faint praise). Genre yard
goods to be sure, but of reasonable quality. Caveat emptor.</p>

<pre>
%T Use of Weapons
%A Iain M. Banks
%I DelRey
%D April 1992
%O paperback, US$4.99
%P 389
%G ISBN 0-553-29224-2
</pre>

<p>Yet another wide-screen space-opera in the Culture/Idiran
universe, from the author of <cite>Consider Phlebas</cite> (<a
href="RR00156.html">RR#156</a>). This one is a bit darker, with
some truely gruesome and psychologically wrenching stuff in it.
Nevertheless, it's a terrific bit of writing. Careful readers will
notice a weird set of anti-symmetries between Bora Horza Gorbuchul
(last book) and this one's Cheradenine Zakalwe. Makes me wonder
what Banks is going to do with the promised third book,
<cite>Against A Dark Background</cite>.</p>
