= README for shipper =

shipper automates the tedious process of shipping a software release
to several standard places, including your own hosted website.

Requires Python 3 and ssh.  Wants gitlab-igor, irker, lftp, and the Twthon library.

You can run a regression test on this software with 'make check'.

Known bugs and to-do items are in TODO.
