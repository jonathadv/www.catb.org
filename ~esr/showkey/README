All this program does is read keystrokes and spit them back at you in a simple,
printable form.

This is one of these silly little utilities that you never think you'll need
until some unexpected situation pops up and you have to have it.  Then you
get to be mugged by the details of tty-interface code, yippee.  Never again!
