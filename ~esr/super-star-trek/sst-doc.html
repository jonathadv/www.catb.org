with the Klingon Empire.  Joining the Klingons against the Federation
are the members of the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Romulan Star Empire.</span>”</span>  As commander of the
Starship U.S.S. Enterprise, your job is to wipe out the Klingon
invasion fleet and make the galaxy safe for democracy.</p><p>Your battleground is the entire galaxy, which for convenience is
divided up into eight rows of eight quadrants each, like a
checkerboard.  Rows are numbered from top to bottom, and columns are
numbered left to right, so quadrant 1 - 8 would be in the upper right
hand corner of the galaxy.</p><p>During battle you will be concerned only with those enemies that
occupy the same quadrant as yourself.  Quadrants are divided up into
sectors: ten rows of ten sectors each. Sectors are numbered in the
same way as quadrants, so the sector in the upper right corner is
sector 1 - 10.  You have a short-range scanner which allows you to
look at the entire quadrant in a single display.</p><p>Enemies recharge during your absence.  If you leave a quadrant
containing a weakened enemy, when you return to that quadrant he will
be strong again.  Also, each time you enter a quadrant, the positions
of everthing in the quadrant (except your ship) are randomized, to
save you the trouble of trying to remember where everything in the
quadrant is.  Notice that this refers only to the positions of things
in the quadrant—the numbers of each kind of thing are not changed
(except for black holes and the Super-commander, which move around
the galaxy).  If you kill something, it stays dead.</p><p>The Romulans are not as serious a threat to the Federation as the
Klingons.  For one thing, there are not as many of them.  For
another, the Romulans are not as treacherous.  However, Romulans are
not to be trifled with, especially when you are in violation of the
Romulan Neutral Zone.</p><p>There are two kinds of Klingons: Ordinary Klingons, which are
bad enough, and Klingon Commanders, which are even worse.  Commanders
are about three times stronger than ordinary Klingons.  Commanders are
more resistant to your weapons.  Commanders can move about during
battle while Ordinary Klingons stay put.  And finally, Commanders have
a thing called a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">long-range tractor beam</span>”</span> which they can
use, at random intervals, to yank you away from what you are doing
into their quadrant, to do battle with them.  There is also a special
commander, called the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Super-commander.</span>”</span> This character
is so bad he is reserved for the Good, Expert, and Emeritus games.
Fortunately, there is just one Super-commander in a game.  In addition
to the undesirable traits of Commanders, he can move from quadrant to
quadrant at will, seeking out and destroying your starbases and any
helpful planets he runs across.  He also has a spy planted aboard your
ship, giving him valuable information about your condition.  Using
this information, he can do dastardly things like tractor beam your
ship when you are in bad shape.  And once you've been tractor beamed
by the Super-commander —</p><p>But the advantages are not all on the side of the enemy.  Your ship
is more powerful, and has better weapons.  Besides, in the this
galaxy there are from two to five starbases, at which you can stop to
refuel and lick your wounds, safe from phaser attack or tractor
beams.  But you had best not dally there too long, since time is not
on your side.  The Klingons are not just after you; they are
attacking the entire Federation.  There is always a finite <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">time
left,</span>”</span> which is how much longer the Federation can hold out if you
just sit on your fat behind and do nothing.  As you wipe out
Klingons, you reduce the rate at which the invasion fleet weakens the
Federation, and so the time left until the Federation collapses may
actually increase.  Since Klingons are the main threat to the
Federation, the Romulans do not figure into the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">time left.</span>”</span>  In
fact, you need not kill all the Romulans to win.  If you can get all
the Klingons, the Federation will abide forever, and you have won the
game.</p><p>Space is vast, and it takes precious time to move from one place to
another.  In comparison, other things happen so quickly that we
assume they take no time at all. Two ways that time can pass are when
you move, or when you issue a command to sit still and rest for a
period of time.  You will sometimes want to do the latter, since the
various devices aboard your starship may be damaged and require time
to repair.  Of course, repairs can be made more quickly at a starbase
than than can in flight.</p><p>In addition to Klingons, Romulans, and starbases, the galaxy
contains (surprise) stars.  Mostly, stars are a nuisance and just get
in your way.  You can trigger a star into going nova by shooting one
of your photon torpedoes at it.  When a star novas, it does a lot of
dammage to anything immediately adjacent to it.  If another star is
adjacent to a nova, it too will go nova.  Stars may also occasionally
go supernova; a supernova in a quadrant destroys everything in the
quadrant andmakes the quadrant permanently uninhabitable.  You may
<span class="quote">“<span class="quote">jump over</span>”</span> a quadrant containing a supernova when you
move, but you should not stop there.</p><p>Supernovas may happen spontaneously, without provocation.  If a
supernova occurs in the same quadrant you are in, your starship has an
<span class="quote">“<span class="quote">emergency automatic override</span>”</span> which picks some random
direction and some random warp factor, and tries to throw you clear of
the supernova. If the supernova occurs in some other quadrant, you
just get a warning message from starfleet about it (provided, of
course, that your subspace radio is working).</p><p>Also a few planets are scattered through the galaxy.  These can
sometimes be a great help since some of them will have <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">dilithium
crystals,</span>”</span> which are capable of replenishing the ship's energy
supply.  You can either beam down to the planet surface using the
transporter, or take the shuttle craft <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Galileo</span>”</span>.</p><p>Finally, each quadrant will contain from zero to three black
holes.  These can deflect or swallow torpedoes passing near them. They
also swallow enemy ships knocked into them.  If your ship enters one
—</p><p>Star Trek is a rich game, full of detail.  These instructions are
written at a moderate level—no attempt has been made fully to
describe everything about the game, but there is quite a bit more
here than you need to get started.  If you are new to the game, just
get a rough idea of the kinds of commands available, and start
playing.  After a game or two you will have learned everthing
important, and the detailed command descriptions which follow will be
a lot more meaningful to you.</p><p>You have weapons: phasers and photon torpedoes. You have a defense:
deflector shields.  You can look at things: long-range scanners,
short-range scanners, and a star chart.  You can move about, under
warp drive or impulse power.  You can also dock at a starbase, rest
while repairs are being made, abandon ship, self destruct, or give up
and start a new game.</p><p>The Klingons are waiting.</p></div><div class="chapter"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="idm51"></a>Chapter 2. Starting the Game</h1></div></div></div><p>The program will ask you some setup questions.  You can give it 
command-line arguments that will be treated as answers.  Any token
may be abbreviated to a unique prefix.</p><p>The first question concerns whether you want a regullar,
tournament, or saved game.  For discussion, see the <a class="link" href="#freeze" title="Freeze">description of the freeze command</a>.</p><p>The second question will concern the length of the game.  
Longer games include more enemies.</p><p>The third question will set the game's difficulty level.
You should probably start out at the novice level, even if you are
already familiar with one of the other versions of the Star Trek
game—but, of course, the level of game you play is up to you.  If
you want to start at the Expert level, go ahead.  It's your funeral.
The Emeritus game is strictly for masochists.</p><p>The fourth question, new in SST2K, sets the wayback machine.  A
blank answer enables all SST2K features.  Given a year, it will disable
features not implemented in that year or earlier. The year
'1973' approximated the original CDC 6600 FORTRAN game from UT Austin.
Here is a mapping of years to features:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">1974</span></dt><dd><p>Planets and dilithium mining</p></dd><dt><span class="term">1979</span></dt><dd><p>Tholians and their webs, supercommanders.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">1980</span></dt><dd><p>Deep-space probes.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">1981</span></dt><dd><p>Bad guys do tactical movement.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">1982</span></dt><dd><p>Bad guys can ram you.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">1997</span></dt><dd><p>Death ray gets an upgrade.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">1998</span></dt><dd><p>Automatic generation of self-destruct password.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">2004</span></dt><dd><p>Upgraded shields for bases, and chance of time-waeping through a black hole.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">2005</span></dt><dd><p>Our ship is bracketed in the chart/</p></dd><dt><span class="term">2006</span></dt><dd><p>Logic for inhabited worlds and Klingon captures.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">2007</span></dt><dd><p>Automatically update the long-range scan when displaying the chart.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">2010</span></dt><dd><p>Use color in interface.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">2013</span></dt><dd><p>Defeated Klingons can be captured.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">2014</span></dt><dd><p>The cloaking device.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">2019</span></dt><dd><p>Consistent dot-filling in the galaxy chart.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">2023</span></dt><dd><p>Alphameric coordinates.</p></dd></dl></div><p>Some caveats apply.  The development history of this game is obscure; some
years of introduction have had to be guessed, and we have chosen guesses to
make support as many interesting wayback options as possible.  Some options
are not affected by the wayback setting - notably, the TUI interface is always
available even though it wasn't written until 2005.  Some early features,
notably "clockface" course setting, couldn't be reconstructed.</p></div><div class="chapter"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="idm125"></a>Chapter 3. How To Issue Commands</h1></div></div></div><p>When the game is waiting for you to enter a command it will
print out</p><pre class="screen">
	COMMAND&gt;
</pre><p>You may then type in your command.  All you have to remember for each
command is the mnemonic. For example, if you want to move straight up
one quadrant, you can type in the mnemonic (case insensitive)</p><pre class="screen">
	move
</pre><p>and the computer will prompt you with</p><pre class="screen">
	Manual or automatic- 
</pre><p>Say you type in <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">manual</span>”</span>. The computer then responds</p><pre class="screen">
	X and Y displacements- 
</pre><p>Now you type in <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">0 1</span>”</span> which specifies an X movement of zero and a Y
movement of one.</p><p>When you have learned the commands, you can avoid being prompted
simply by typing in the information without waiting to be asked for
it. For example, in the above example, you could simply type in</p><pre class="screen">
	move manual 0 1
</pre><p>and it will be done.  Or you could type in</p><pre class="screen">
	move manual
</pre><p>and when the computer responds with the displacement prompt, you
can type in</p><pre class="screen">
	0 1
</pre><p>and it will understand.</p><p>You can abbreviate most mnemonics.  For <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">move</span>”</span>, you can use any
of</p><pre class="screen">
	move mov mo m
</pre><p>successfully.  For your safety, certain critical commands (such as to
abandon ship) must be written out in full.  Also, in a few cases two
or more commands begin with the same letter, and in this case that
letter refers to a particular one of the commands; to get the other,
your abbreviation must be two or more characters long.  This sounds
complicated, but you will learn the abbreviations quickly enough.</p><p>What this all boils down to is:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>You can abbreviate practically anything</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If you forget, the computer will prompt you</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If you remember, you can type it all on one line</p></li></ol></div><p>If you are part way through entering a command and you change your
mind, you can cancel the command by typing -1 as one of the
parameters, with the exception of the manual move command.</p><p>If anything is not clear to you, experiment.  The worst you can do is
lose a game or two.</p></div><div class="chapter"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="idm159"></a>Chapter 4. List of Commands</h1></div></div></div><div class="toc"><p><strong>Table of Contents</strong></p><dl class="toc"><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#idm161">Short-Range Scan</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#idm177">Status Report</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#idm245">Long-Range Scan</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#idm274">Star Chart</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#idm280">Damage Report</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#idm286">Move Under Warp Drive</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#idm313">Warp Factor</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#idm320">Impulse Engines</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#idm327">Deflector Shields</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#idm340">Phasers</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#idm356">Cloak</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#idm362">Capture</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#idm368">Report</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#idm393">Computer</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#idm397">Photon Torpedoes</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#idm417">Dock at Starbase</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#idm425">Rest</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#idm430">Call Starbase for Help</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#idm438">Abandon Ship</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#idm443">Self-Destruct</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#idm448">Quit Game</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#idm452">Sensor-Scan</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#idm456">Enter Standard Orbit</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#idm460">Transporter Travel</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#idm469">Shuttle Craft</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#idm476">Mine Dilithium Crystals</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#idm483">Load Dilithium Crystals</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#idm489">Planet Report</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#freeze">Freeze</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#idm504">Request</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#idm561">Experimental Death Ray</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#idm570">Launch Deep Space Probe</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#idm578">Emergency Exit</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#idm583">Ask for Help</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#idm587">Curses switch</a></span></dt><dt><span class="sect1"><a href="#idm591">Option setting</a></span></dt></dl></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm161"></a>Short-Range Scan</h2></div></div></div><div class="literallayout"><p><br />

</pre><p>This scan says that you are in row 5, column 1 of the 8 by 8 galaxy.
The numbers in the scan indicate how many of each kind of thing there

indicates 3 Klingons, 1 starbase, and 6 stars.  The long-range
scanner does not distinguish between ordinary Klingons and Klingon
command ships.  If there is a supernova, as in the quadrant below and

telemetry sensors are ejected which will report any changes in the

working. Spock will enter this information in the chart. If the radio
is not working, Spock can only enter new information discovered from
scans, and information in other quadrants may be obsolete.</p><p>The chart looks like an 8 by 8 array of numbers.  These numbers are
interpreted exactly as they are on a long-range scan. A period (.) in

Shortest abbreviation:  M<br />
Full command:  MOVE MANUAL &lt;displacement&gt;<br />
               MOVE AUTOMATIC &lt;destination&gt;<br />
</p></div><p>This command is the usual way to move from one place to another
within the galaxy.  You move under warp drive, according to the
current warp factor (see <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">WARP FACTOR</span>”</span>).</p><p>There are two command modes for movement: MANUAL and AUTOMATIC.
The manual mode requires the following format:</p><pre class="screen">
	MOVE MANUAL &lt;deltax&gt; &lt;deltay&gt;
</pre><p>&lt;deltax&gt; and &lt;deltay&gt; are the horizontal and vertical
displacements for your starship, in quadrants; a displacement of one
sector is 0.1 quadrants.  Specifying &lt;deltax&gt; and &lt;deltay&gt;
causes your ship to move in a straight line to the specified
destination. If &lt;deltay&gt; is omitted, it is assumed zero. For
example, the shortest possible command to move one sector to the right
would be</p><pre class="screen">
	M M .1
</pre><p>The following examples of manual movement refer to the short-range
scan shown earlier.</p><pre class="screen">
  Destination Sector	Manual Movement command
	3 - 1			M M -.3 -.1
	2 - 1			M M -.3
	1 - 2			M M -.2 .1
	1 - 4			M M 0 .1
  (leaving quadrant)		M M 0 .2
</pre><p>The automatic mode is as follows:</p><pre class="screen">
	MOVE AUTOMATIC &lt;qrow&gt; &lt;qcol&gt; &lt;srow&gt; &lt;scol&gt;
</pre><p>&lt;para&gt;where &lt;qrow&gt; and &lt;qcol&gt; are the row and column
numbers of the destination quadrant, and &lt;srow&gt; and &lt;scol&gt;
are the row and column numbers of the destination sector in that
quadrant.  This command also moves your ship in a straight line path
to the destination.  For moving within a quadrant, &lt;qrow&gt; and
&lt;qcol&gt; may be omitted. For example, to move to sector 2 - 9 in
the current quadrant, the shortest command would be</p><pre class="screen">
	M A 2 9
</pre><p>To move to quadrant 3 - 7, sector 5 - 8, type</p><pre class="screen">
	M A 3 7 5 8
</pre><p>and it will be done.  In automatic mode, either two or four numbers
must be supplied.</p><p> If your game is in "fancy" mode, there ia a way to input
coordinates that avoids any need to remember thet the Y coordinate
comes first.  Y values may be given as lowercase letters starting with
a = 1. So for example:</p><pre class="screen">
	a1 = 1 - 1
	c5 = 3 - 5
	f2 = 6 - 2
</pre><p>The previous move xommand could be expressed as</p><pre class="screen">
	m a c7 e8
</pre><p>Automatic mode utilizes the ship's <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">battle
computer.</span>”</span> If the computer is damaged, manual movement must be
used.</p><p>If warp engines are damaged less than 10 stardates (undocked) you can
still go warp 4.</p><p>It uses time and energy to move.  How much time and how much energy
depends on your current warp factor, the distance you move, and
whether your shields are up.  The higher the warp factor, the faster
you move, but higher warp factors require more energy.  You may move
with your shields up, but this doubles the energy required.</p><p>You can move within a quadrant without being attacked if you just
entered the quadrant or have been attacked since your last move
command.  This enables you to move and hit them before they
retaliate.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm313"></a>Warp Factor</h2></div></div></div><div class="literallayout"><p><br />

warp factor, the faster you go and the more energy you use.</p><p>Your minimum warp factor is 1.0 and your maximum warp factor is 10.0
(which is 100 times as fast and uses 1000 times as much energy).  At
speeds above warp 6 there is some danger of causing damage to your
warp engines; this damage is larger at higher warp factors and also
depends on how far you go at that warp factor.</p><p>At exactly warp 10 there is some probability of entering a

</p></div><p>Your deflector shields are a defensive device to protect you from
Klingon attacks (and nearby novas).  As the shields protect you, they
gradually weaken.  A shield strength of 75%, for example, means that
the next time a Klingon hits you, your shields will deflect 75% of
the hit, and let 25% get through to hurt you.</p><p>It costs 50 units of energy to raise shields, nothing to lower them.
You may move with your shields up; this costs nothing under impulse
power, but doubles the energy required for warp drive.</p><p>Each time you raise or lower your shields, the Klingons have another
chance to attack.  Since shields do not raise and lower
instantaneously, the hits you receive will be intermediate between
what they would be if the shields were completely up or completely
down. </p><p>You may not fire phasers through your shields.  However you may
use the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">high-speed shield control</span>”</span> to lower shields,
fire phasers, and raise the shields again before the Klingons can
react.  Since rapid lowering and raising of the shields requires more
energy than normal speed operation, it costs you 200 units of energy
to activate this control.  It is automatically activated when you fire
phasers while shields are up.  You may fire photon torpedoes, but they
may be deflected considerably from their intended course as they pass
through the shields (depending on shield strength).</p><p>You may transfer energy beteen the ship's energy (given as
<span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Energy</span>”</span> in the status) and the shields.  The word
<span class="quote">“<span class="quote">TRANSFER</span>”</span> may be abbreviated <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">T</span>”</span>.  The
ammount of energy to transfer is the number of units of energy you
wish to take from the ship's energy and put into the shields.  If you
specify an negative number, energy is drained from the shields to the
ship.  Transfering energy constitutes a turn.  If you transfer energy
to the shields while you are under attack, they will be at the new
energy level when you are next hit.</p><p>Enemy torpedoes hitting your ship explode on your shields (if they
are up) and have essentially the same effect as phaser hits.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm340"></a>Phasers</h2></div></div></div><div class="literallayout"><p><br />

</p></div><p>Phasers are energy weapons. As you fire phasers at Klingons, you
specify an <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">amount to fire</span>”</span> which is drawn from your
energy reserves.  The amount of total hit required to kill an enemy is
partly random.  but also depends on skill level.</p><p>The average hit required to kill an ordinary Klingon varies from 200
units in the Novice game to 250 units in the Emeritus game.
Commanders normally require from 600 (Novice) to 700 (Emeritus).  The
Super-commander requres from 875 (Good) to 1000 (Emeritus). Romulans
require an average of 350 (Novice) to 450 (Emeritus).</p><p>Hits on enemies are cumulative, as long as you don't leave the
quadrant. </p><p>In general, not all that you fire will reach the Klingons.  The
farther away they are, the less phaser energy will reach them. If a
Klingon is adjacent to you, he will receive about 90% of the phaser
energy directed at him; a Klingon 5 sectors away will receive about
60% and a Klingon 10 sectors away will receive about 35%. There is
some randomness involved, so these figures are not exact. Phasers
have no effect beyond the boundaries of the quadrant you are in.</p><p>Phasers may overheat (and be damaged) if you fire too large a burst
at once. Firing up to 1500 units is safe.  From 1500 on up the
probability of overheat increases with the amount fired.</p><p>If phaser firing is automatic, the computer decides how to
divide up your &lt;amount to fire&gt; among the Klingons present.  If
phaser firing is manual, you specify how much energy to fire at each
Klingon present (nearest first), rather than just specifying a total
amount.  You can abreviate <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">MANUAL</span>”</span> and
<span class="quote">“<span class="quote">AUTOMATIC</span>”</span> to one or more letters; if you mention
neither, automatic fire is usually assumed.</p><p>Battle computer information is available by firing phasers manually,
and allowing the computer to prompt you.  If you enter zero for the
amount to fire at each enemy, you will get a complete report, without
cost.  The battle computer will tell you how much phaser energy to
fire at each enemy for a sure kill.  This information appears in
parentheses prior to the prompt for each enemy.  Since the amount is
computed from sensor data, if either the computer or the S.R. sensors
are damaged, this information will be unavailable, and phasers must
be fired manually.</p><p>A safety interlock prevents phasers from being fired through
the shields.  If this were not so, the shields would contain your fire
and you would fry yourself.  However, you may utilize the
<span class="quote">“<span class="quote">high-speed shield control</span>”</span> to drop shields, fire
phasers, and raise shields before the enemy can react.  Since it takes
more energy to work the shields rapidly with a shot, it costs you 200
units of energy each time you activate this control.  It is
automatically activated when you fire phasers while the shields are
up. By specifying the &lt;no&gt; option, shields are not raised after
firing.</p><p>Phasers have no effect on starbases (which are shielded) or on
stars.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm356"></a>Cloak</h2></div></div></div><div class="literallayout"><p><br />

</p></div><p>Photon torpedoes are projectile weapons—you either hit what you aim
at, or you don't.  There are no <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">partial hits</span>”</span>.</p><p>One photon torpedo will usually kill one ordinary Klingon, but it
usually takes about two for a Klingon Commander.  Photon torpedoes
can also blow up stars and starbases, if you aren't careful.</p><p>You may fire photon torpedoes singly, or in bursts of two or three.
Each torpedo is individually targetable.  The computer will prompt
you, asking for the target sector for each torpedo.  Alternately, you
may specify each target in the command line.</p><p>Photon torpedoes cannot be aimed precisely—there is always some
randomness involved in the direction they go.  Photon torpedoes may
be fired with your shields up, but as they pass through the shields
they are randomly deflected from their intended course even more.</p><p>Photon torpedoes are proximity-fused.  The closer they explode to the
enemy, the more damage they do.  There is a hit <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">window</span>”</span> about one
sector wide.  If the torpedo misses the hit window, it does not
explode and the enemy is unaffected.  Photon torpedoes are only
effective within the quadrant.  They have no effect on things in
adjacent quadrants.</p><p>If more than one torpedo is fired and only one target sector is
specified, all torpedoes are fired at that sector.  For example, to
fire two torpedoes at sector 3 - 4, you type</p><pre class="screen">
     PHO 2 3 4           (or)           PHO 2 3 4 3 4
</pre><p>To fire torpedoes at, consecutively, sectors 2 - 6, 1 - 10, and 4 -
7, type</p><pre class="screen">
     PHO 3 2 6 1 10 4 7
</pre><p>There is no restriction to fire directly at a sector.  For example,
you can enter</p><pre class="screen">
       PHO 1 3 2.5
</pre><p>to aim between two sectors.  However, sector numbers must be 1 to 10
inclusive.</p><p>In fancy mode, you can write "PHO 3 2 6 1 10 4 7" as</p><pre class="screen">

Mnemonic:  DOCK<br />
Shortest abbreviation:  D<br />
</p></div><p>You may dock your starship whenever you are in one of the eight
sector positions immediately adjacent to a starbase.  When you dock,
your starship is resupplied with energy, shield energy photon
torpedoes, and life support reserves.  Repairs also proceed faster at
starbase, so if some of your devices are damaged, you may wish to stay
at base (by using the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">REST</span>”</span> command) until they are
fixed.  If your ship has more than its normal maximum energy (which
can happen if you've loaded crystals) the ship's energy is not
changed.</p><p>You may not dock while in standard orbit around a planet.</p><p>Starbases have their own deflector shields, so you are completely
safe from phaser attack while docked.  You are also safe from
long-range tractor beams.</p><p>Starbases also have both short and long range sensors, which you can
use if yours are broken. There's also a subspace radio to get
information about happenings in the galaxy. Mr. Spock will update the
star chart if your ask for it while docked and your own radio is dead.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm425"></a>Rest</h2></div></div></div><div class="literallayout"><p><br />

</p></div><p>This command simply allows the specified number of stardates to go
by.  This is useful if you have suffered damages and wish to wait
until repairs are made before you go back into battle.</p><p>It is not generally advisable to rest while you are under attack by

Mnemonic:  MAYDAY<br />
(No abbreviation)<br />
</p></div><p>[Originally, this command was called <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">HELP</span>”</span>, but
these days that might be misconstrued as an attempt to browse built-in
documentation! In some later versions it was CALL.]</p><p>When you get into serious trouble, you may call a starbase for
help.  Starbases have a device called a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">long-range transporter
beam</span>”</span> which they can use to teleport you to base.  This works
by dematerializing your starship at its current position and
re-materializing it adjacent to the nearest starbase.  Teleportation
is instantaneous, and starbase supplies the required energy—all
you have to do is let them know (via subspace radio) that you need to
be rescued.</p><p>This command should be employed only when absolutely necessary.  In
the first place, calling for help is an admission on your part that
you got yourself into something you cannot get yourself out of, and
you are heavily penalized for this in the final scoring.  Secondly,
the long-range transporter beam is not reliable—starbase can always
manage to dematerialize your starship, but (depending on distance)
may or may not be able to re-materialize you again.  The long-range
transporter beam has no absolute maximum range; if you are in the
same quadrant as a starbase, you have a good chance (about 90%) of
re-materializing successfully.  your chances drop to roughly 50-50 at
just over 3 quadrants.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm438"></a>Abandon Ship</h2></div></div></div><div class="literallayout"><p><br />

</p></div><p>To land on a planet you must first be in standard orbit.  You achieve
this in a manner similar to docking at starbase.  Moving to one of
the eight sector positions immediately adjacent to the planet, you
give the orbit command which puts your ship into standard orbit about
the planet.  Since this is a maneuver, a small amount of time is
used; negligible energy is required.  If enemies are present, they
will attack.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm460"></a>Transporter Travel</h2></div></div></div><div class="literallayout"><p><br />

</p></div><p>The transporter is a device which can convert any physical object
into energy, beam the energy through space, and reconstruct the
physical object at some destination.  Transporting is one way to land
on a planet.  Since the transporter has a limited range, you must be
in standard orbit to beam down to a planet.  Shields must be down
while transporting.</p><p>The transport command is used to beam a landing party onto a planet
to mine <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">dilithium crystals</span>”</span>.  Each time the command is given the
landing party (which you lead) moves from the ship to the planet, or
vice-versa.</p><p>You are advised against needless transporting, since like all
devices, the transporter will sometimes malfunction.</p><p>The transporter consumes negligible time and energy.  Its use does
not constitute a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">turn</span>”</span>.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm469"></a>Shuttle Craft</h2></div></div></div><div class="literallayout"><p><br />
Mnemonic:  SHUTTLE<br />
Shortest abbreviation:  SHU<br />
</p></div><p>An alternate way to travel to and from planets.  Because of limited
range, you must be in standard orbit to use the shuttle craft, named
"Galileo".  Shields must be down.</p><p>Unlike transporting, use of the shuttle craft does constitute a
<span class="quote">“<span class="quote">turn</span>”</span> since time is consumed.  The time naturally
depends on orbit altitude, and is equal to 3.0e-5 times altitude.
Shuttling uses no ship energy.</p><p>You should use the same travel device going from the planet to the
ship as you use to go from the ship to the planet. However it is
possible to transport to the planet and have the Galileo crew come
and pick your landing party up, or to take the Galileo to the planet
and then transport back, leaving the shuttle craft on the planet.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm476"></a>Mine Dilithium Crystals</h2></div></div></div><div class="literallayout"><p>  <br />

Shortest abbreviation:  MI<br />
</p></div><p>Once you and your mining party are on the surface of a planet which
has dilithium crystals, this command will dig them for you.</p><p>Mining requires time and constitutes a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">turn</span>”</span>.  No
energy is used.  Class M planets require 0.1 to 0.3 stardates to mine.
Class N planets take twice as long, and class O planets take three
times as long.</p><p>Dilithium crystals contain enormous energy in a form that is readily
released in the ship's power system.  It is an excellent idea to mine
them whenever possible, for use in emergencies.  You keep the
crystals until the game is over or you abandon ship when not at a
starbase.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm483"></a>Load Dilithium Crystals</h2></div></div></div><div class="literallayout"><p>  <br />
Mnemonic:  CRYSTALS<br />
Shortest abbreviation:  CR<br />
</p></div><p>This is a very powerful command which should be used with caution.
Once you have dilithium crystals aboard ship, this command will
instruct engineering officer Scott and Mr. Spock to place a raw
dilithium crystal into the power channel of the ship's
matter-antimatter converter.  When it works, this command will
greatly boost the ship's energy.</p><p>Because the crystals are raw and impure, instabilities can occur in
the power channel.  Usually Scotty can control these.  When he
cannot, the results are disastrous. Scotty will use those crystals
that appear to be most stable first.</p><p>Since using raw dilithium crystals for this purpose entails
considerable risk, Starfleet Regulations allow its use only during
"condition yellow".  No time or energy is used.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm489"></a>Planet Report</h2></div></div></div><div class="literallayout"><p>  <br />

Full command:  FREEZE &lt;FILE NAME&gt;<br />
</p></div><p>The purpose of the FREEZE command is to allow a player to save the
current state of the game, so that it can be finished later.  A
plaque may not be generated from a frozen game. A file with the
specified &lt;file name&gt; and type '.TRK' is created (if necessary) in
the current directory, and all pertinent information about the game
is written to that file. The game may be continued as usual or be
terminated at the user's option.</p><p>To restart a game created by the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">FREEZE</span>”</span> command,
the user need only type <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">FROZEN</span>”</span> in response to the
initial question about the type of game desired, followed by the
&lt;file name&gt;.</p><p>NOTE: A <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">tournament</span>”</span> game is like a frozen game,
with the following differences.  (1) Tournament games always start
from the beginning, while a frozen game can start at any point.  (2)
Tournament games require only that the player remember the name or
number of the tournament, while the information about a frozen game
must be kept on a file. Tournament games can be frozen, but then they
behave like regular frozen games.</p><p>A point worth noting is that 'FREEZE' does not save the seed for the
random number generator, so that identical actions after restarting
the same frozen game can lead to different results.  However,
identical actions after starting a given tournament game always lead
to the same results.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm504"></a>Request</h2></div></div></div><div class="literallayout"><p>  <br />

(No abbreviation)<br />
</p></div><p>This command should be used only in those desperate cases where
you have absolutely no alternative.  The death ray uses energy to
rearrange matter.  Unfortunately, its working principles are not yet
thoroughly understood, and the results are highly
unpredictable.</p><p>The only good thing that can result is the destruction of all
enemies in your current quadrant.  This will happen about 70% of the
time.  Only enemies are destroyed; starbases, stars, and planets are
unaffected.</p><p>Constituting the remaining 30% are results varying from bad to
fatal.</p><p>The death ray requires no energy or time, but if you survive, enemies
will hit you.</p><p>The Faerie Queene has no death ray.</p><p>If the death ray is damaged in its use, it must be totally replaced.
This can only be done at starbase.  Because it is a very complex

Courses are given in manual mode in X - Y displacements; in automatic
    mode as destination quadrant and/or sector.  Manual mode is default.
Distances are given in quadrants.  A distance of one sector is 0.1 quadrant.
Ordinary Klingons have about 400 units of energy, Commanders about
    1200.  Romulans normally have about 800 units of energy, and the
    (GULP) "Super-Commander" has about 1800.
Phaser fire diminishes to about 60 percent at 5 sectors.  Up to 1500
    units may be fired in a single burst without danger of overheat.
Warp 6 is the fastest safe speed.  At higher speeds, engine damage
    may occur.  At warp 10 you may enter a time warp.
Shields cost 50 units of energy to raise, and double the power
    requirements of moving under warp drive.  Engaging the high-speed
    shield control requires 200 units of energy.
Warp drive requires (distance)*(warp factor cubed) units of energy
    to travel at a speed of (warp factor squared)/10 quadrants per stardate.
Impulse engines require 20 units to warm up, plus 100 units per
     quadrant.  Speed is just under one sector per stardate.

Mayfield at the beginning of the 1970s.  His first version was in
BASIC for a Sigma 7 in 1971; in 1972 he rewrote it in Hewlett Packard
BASIC. The source is included in the SST2K repository.  In January
1975 it became part of the DECUS library under the name <a class="ulink" href="http://www.trailing-edge.com/~shoppa/decus/110174.html" target="_top">SPACWR</a>.</p><p>While some people claim to have recollections of playing Trek
games in the late 1960s, the earlier ones seem actually to have been
variants of
<a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacewar!" target="_top">
SPACEWAR</a>, the earlier space-combat game on the
PDP-1. Mayfield <a class="ulink" href="http://www3.sympatico.ca/maury/games/space/star_trek.html" target="_top">wrote
in 2000</a> that he invented the Trek-style galactic grid, and the
evidence seems to back that up.  Some of the confusion probably stems 
from the fact that Mayfield's original and several early descendants 
were distributed under the name SPACWR.</p><p>Many different versions radiated from Mayfield's original; most
of the ones in BASIC are descended from a SPACWR version that David
Ahl published in <em class="citetitle">101 BASIC Computer Games</em>,
July 1973. This was a port of Mayfield's version obtained from the HP
Contributed Programs library.  </p><p>Our SST2K is descended from a Taurus BASIC program by Grady
Hicks dated 5 April 1973. This does not appear to have been derived
from Ahl's SPACWR. The header says "GENERAL IDEA STOLEN FROM
PENN. U.", and the game has several features not present in SPACEWR:
notably, the Death Ray, ramming, and the Klingon summons to surrender.
And, of course, it predates Ahl's book.  The source is included in the
SST2K repository.</p><p>Dave Matuszek, Paul Reynolds et. al. at UT Austin played the
Hicks version on a CDC6600, but disliked the long load time and
extreme slowness of the BASIC program. (David Matuszek notes that the
Hicks version he played had a habit of throwing long quotes from
Marcus Aurelius at the users, a feature he found intolerable on a TTY
at 110 baud.  It must, therefore, have been rather longer than the one
we have.)</p><p>The Austin crew proceeded to write their own Trek game, loosely
based on the Hicks version, in CDC6600 FORTRAN.  Most of the code was
written in 1973-1974. At that time, the game was just called "Star
Trek"; the "Super" was added by later developers. In the rest of this
history we'll call it the "UT FORTRAN" version.</p><p>Dave Matuszek reports that the UT FORTRAN codebase he worked on
in 1973-1974 was like Mayfield's original and most later versions in
BASIC, in that it used used polar coordinates (a clockface angle
and a distance) for manual navigation.</p><p>Tom Almy writes: "I've received further information that the
black holes, Tholian web, Super Commander, and Emeritus mode were
added by Marc Newman."</p><p>At the time the UT FORTRAN source was last translated to C it emitted
the message "Latest update-21 Sept 78".  Thus, it actually predated
(and may have influenced) the best-known BASIC version, the "Super
Star Trek" published by David Ahl in his November 1978 sequel
<em class="citetitle">BASIC Computer Games</em>.</p><p>This 1978 "Super Star Trek" had been reworked by Robert Leedom
and friends from (according to Leedom) Mayfield's HP port. There is
internal evidence to suggest that at least some features of Leedom's
SST may have derived from the UT FORTRAN version.  In particular, Dave
Matuszek recalls implementing command words to replace the original
numeric command codes during 1973-1974, a feature Leedom's SST also
had but the 1973 and 1975 SPACWRs did not.</p><p>One signature trait of the UT FORTRAN game and its descendants
is that the sectors are 10x10 (rather than the 8x8 in Mike Mayfield's
1972 original and its BASIC descendants).  The UT FORTRAN version also
preserves the original numbered quadrants rather than the
astronomically-named quadrants introduced in Ahl's SST and its
descendants.</p><p>Eric Allman's BSD Trek game is one of these, also descended from
the UT FORTRAN version via translation to C.  However, the mainline version
(now SST2K) has had a lot more stuff folded into it over the years
— deep space probes, dilithium mining, the Tholian Web, and so
forth.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm684"></a>Tom Almy's story</h2></div></div></div><p>Back in (about) 1977 I got a copy of the Super Star Trek game for
the CDC 6600 mainframe computer. Someone had converted it to PDP-11
Fortran but couldn't get it to run because of its size. I modified
the program to use overlays and managed to shoehorn it in on the 56k
byte machine.</p><p>I liked the game so much I put some time into fixing bugs, mainly
what could be called continuity errors and loopholes in the game's
logic. We even played a couple tournaments.</p><p>In 1979, I lost access to that PDP-11. I did save the source code
listing. In 1995, missing that old friend, I started converting the
program into portable ANSI C. It's been slow, tedious work that took
over a year to accomplish.</p><p>In early 1997, I got the bright idea to look for references to
<span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Super Star Trek</span>”</span> on the World Wide Web. There weren't
many hits, but there was one that came up with 1979 Fortran sources!
This version had a few additional features that mine didn't have,
however mine had some feature it didn't have. So I merged its features
that I liked. I also took a peek at the DECUS version (a port, less
sources, to the PDP-10), and some other variations.</p><p>Modifications I made:</p><p>Compared to original version, I've changed the
<span class="quote">“<span class="quote">help</span>”</span> command to <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">call</span>”</span> and the
<span class="quote">“<span class="quote">terminate</span>”</span> command to <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">quit</span>”</span> to better
match user expectations. The DECUS version apparently made those
changes as well as changing <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">freeze</span>”</span> to
<span class="quote">“<span class="quote">save</span>”</span>. However I like <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">freeze</span>”</span>.</p><p>I added EMEXIT from the 1979 version.</p><p>That later version also mentions srscan and lrscan working when
docked (using the starbase's scanners), so I made some changes here
to do this (and indicating that fact to the player), and then
realized the base would have a subspace radio as well — doing a
Chart when docked updates the star chart, and all radio reports will
be heard. The Dock command will also give a report if a base is under
attack.</p><p>It also had some added logic to spread the initial positioning of
bases. That made sense to add because most people abort games with
bad base placement.</p><p>The experimental deathray originally had only a 5% chance of success,
but could be used repeatedly. I guess after a couple years of use, it
was less <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">experimental</span>”</span> because the 1979 version had a 70% success
rate. However it was prone to breaking after use. I upgraded the
deathray, but kept the original set of failure modes (great humor!).</p><p>I put in the Tholian Web code from the 1979 version.</p><p>I added code so that Romulans and regular Klingons could move in 
advanced games. I re-enabled the code which allows enemy ships to
ram the Enterprise; it had never worked right. The 1979 version
seems to have it all fixed up, but I'm still not overly happy with
the algorithm.</p><p>The DECUS version had a Deep Space Probe. Looked like a good idea
so I implemented it based on its description.</p><p>I imported CAPTURE from BSD Trek.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm709"></a>Stas Sergeev's story</h2></div></div></div><p>I started from an older Tom Almy version and added features I had

DEC minicomputer.  In the late 1980s Dave Matuszek and I became
friends; I was vaguely aware that he had had something to do with the
original Star Trek game.  In October 2004, sitting in Dave's living
room, we got to talking about the game and I realized it would make a
great exhibit for the <a class="ulink" href="http://catb.org/~esr/retro/" target="_top">Retrocomputing Museum</a>.</p><p>A few quick web searches later we found Tom Almy's page.  We
downloaded his code and Dave verified that that it was a direct
descendent of UT Super Star Trek — even though it had been translated
to C, he was able to recognize names and techniques from the FORTRAN
version he co-wrote.</p><p>This game became an open-source project; see the <a class="ulink" href="http://developer.berlios.de/projects/sst/" target="_top">project
site</a>.</p><p>After I launched the Berlios project, Stas Sergeev contacted me.
We worked together to merge in his changes.</p><p>Modifications I've made:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
I converted the flat-text SST.DOC file to XML-Docbook so it can be
webbed. (That's what you're reading now.)
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
The command-help code needed a rewrite because the flat-text form of
the documentation is now generated from XML and doesn't have the
easily recognizable section delimiters it used to.  I wrote a script
to filter that flat-text form into an sst.doc that's easy to parse for
command descriptions, and changed some logic in sst.c to match.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
I've cleaned up a lot of grubby FORTRANisms in the code internals —
used sizeof(), replaced magic numeric constants with #defines,
that sort of thing.  Later I translated the code from C to Python.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
I fixed a surprising number of typos in the code and documentation.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
All the game state now lives in one big structure that can be
written to and read from disk as one blob.  The write gives it an
an identifiable magic number and the thaw logic checks for same. 
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
I made the internal pager work, and in the process got rid of a number
of platform dependencies in the code.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
The HELP/CALL/SOS command is now MAYDAY.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Status report now indicates if dilithium crystals are on board.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
At Dave's prompting, restored the Space Thingy's original elusive behavior.

Clean separation of game engine from the UI code, improving Stas
