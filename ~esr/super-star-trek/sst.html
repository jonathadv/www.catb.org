at war with the Klingon Empire. Joining the Klingons against the
Federation are the members of the Romulan Star Empire. As commander
of the Starship U.S.S. Enterprise, your job is to wipe out the Klingon
invasion fleet and make the galaxy safe for democracy.</p><p>This is one of the great early classic computer games from the
1970s and still has a remarkable amount of play value. Run
<span class="command"><strong>sst</strong></span> in a terminal window to start it.  Typing
'commands' at the prompt will list all commands; help is available for
each one individually as well.  Full documentation is <a class="ulink" href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/super-star-trek/sst-doc.html" target="_top">browseable</a>.  On
systems where <code class="filename">/usr/share/doc/sst/</code> is a legal
filename, it will probably be installed there as well.</p><p>The option -t forces the original pure-tty mode.
Normally sst tries to come up in full-screen mode that assumes it is
running on a cursor-addressable terminal or terminal emulator.</p><p>The option -r sets up replay of a session logfile.  Commands
in the logfile are executed, then additional commands are taken
from stdin as normal.  The -r option forces -t mode.</p><p>The option -x enables some debugging features of interest
probably only to sst2k developers.</p><p>With -V, the program emits its version and exits.</p><p>Input tokens for the setup prompts will be read from the
remainder of the command line before standard input.  Thus, for
example, you can invoke the program as</p><pre class="programlisting">
sst regular medium good fancy
</pre><p>to start a regular medium game as a good player in 'fancy'
mode (all features enabled).</p></div><div class="refsect1"><a name="files"></a><h2>FILES</h2><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term"><code class="filename">/usr/share/doc/sst/sst.doc</code></span></dt><dd><p>Documentation file.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="filename">$TMPDIR/sst-input.log</code></span></dt><dd><p>Where user input is saved to (send this with your bug reports).

Reynolds, and Don Smith beginning in 1973; at that time it was called
simply 'Trek'.  It was resurrected by Tom Almy.  The screen-oriented
interface is by Stas Sergeev. This version has been improved, cleaned
up and documented by Eric S. Raymond
