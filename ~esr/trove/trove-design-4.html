<H2><A NAME="s4">4. Security and Authentication</A></H2>

<P>There are two levels of protection in the Trove design.  Which will
operate depends on whether a contributor is authenticated or not.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Security through Visibility</A>
</H2>

<P>The contributor who creates a package entry, and anyone who changes
the package metadata or resources after the fact, will be put on the
package's heads-up list.  Every time the package metadata is modified
after that, the updating contributor will be added to the heads-up
list, and everybody on the heads-up list will be notified.
<P>The intent of this feature (and the requirement that unsubscription
requests be validated) is to make sure that all metadata &amp; resource
changes are visible to everybody with a stake in the package.  In
particular, any modifications an unauthorized person succeeds in doing
will be visible to the real package owners.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 Security through Authentication</A>
</H2>

<P>Either a resource or a package may be <EM>locked</EM>.  When an item
(resource or package) is locked, any request to modify it must be
authenticated as coming from a <EM>maintainer</EM> of the package.
<P>Here are the rules of maintainership: 
<P>1. The <EM>owner</EM> of an item is the person who can add and delete
maintainers. 
<UL>
<LI>The owner of an item is automatically an maintainer of the item. </LI>
<LI>The person who creates an item is its first owner.</LI>
<LI>The owner may pass the owner role to another validated user.</LI>
</UL>
<P>2. Any maintainer of an item (package or resource) can modify or delete the
item.
<P>3. The maintainers of a package may delete associated resources.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 How To Authenticate Requests</A>
</H2>

<P>The Trove authentication system leverages the PGP-key infrastructure.
To authenticate a TRL request, you must sign it with PGP.  The shovel
program will check the signature.  If the key ID matches the TRL
Contributor line, the request is considered authenticated.
<P>The big advantage of this system is that it leverages the public-key
infrastructure.  This means that Trove won't need to keep any secrets
of its own, and contributors don't need any secrets other than their
existing PGP passphrases.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.4">4.4 Package Authentication</A>
</H2>

<P>To be specified.  Base on the
