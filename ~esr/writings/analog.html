<p class='notebox'>This essay appeared in the June-July 2004 issue
of <cite>Analog</cite> magazine.  It came first in the 2005 
Analytical Laboratory awards for fact articles.</p>

<p>There is a revolution going on in software development today
that Analog readers should find especially interesting &mdash; because
that revolution has some roots in the hard-SF tradition, and
because it raises some fundamental questions about not just the
technological machinery of our computers but the social, economic
and political machinery that surrounds software development.
Because computers and the Internet are becoming such a vital part
of our infrastructure, the way human beings frame answers to those
questions may well play a significant part in shaping the future of
our civilization.</p>

<p>That revolution is called &ldquo;open-source development&rdquo;,
its showpieces are the Internet and the Linux operating system, it's
founded on a re-discovery of the power of decentralized peer networks
for verifying solutions to complex problems, and it finally offers us
the prospect of routinely achieving decent reliability and
mean-time-between-failure (MTBF) rates in software.  That is, using
open-source techniques we can achieve error rates at least comparable
to those in computer hardware engineering, and in important cases
(such as the Internet) comparable to the robustness of large-scale
civil engineering. Open source gives us these benefits, however, at
the cost of effectively dynamiting the standard secrecy-intensive
business models for software production, a change with large economic
repercussions &mdash; including, very probably, the near-term collapse
or radical transformation of Microsoft and most of the rest of the
current software industry.</p>

<p>This article is a report from the front lines by a long-time
Analog reader who found himself semi-accidentally cast as one of
the revolution's theoreticians. I have written this article partly
as personal history because that history shows how the tradition of
Analog-style hard SF was an important ingredient in the
(re)discovery of open source.</p>

<h2>The Open Source Idea</h2>

<p>The &ldquo;source&rdquo; in &ldquo;open source&rdquo; refers to
what computer scientists call &ldquo;source code&rdquo; &mdash; the
human-readable, human-editable form of a program that computer
programmers work with. Most computer users only see &ldquo;object
code&rdquo;, the opaque block of bits that the computer actually
runs. While it is relatively easy to translate source code into object
code (typically using a special kind of program called a
&ldquo;compiler&rdquo;), it is extremely difficult (in many cases,
effectively impossible) to translate object code back into readable
source code.</p>

<p>The core idea of open-source development is very simple:
open-source programmers have learned that secrecy is the enemy of
quality. The most effective way to achieve reliability in software
is to publish its source code for active peer review by other
programmers and by non-programmer domain experts in the software's
application area. This premise implies an inversion of traditional
prescriptions for managing software development &mdash; a shift from
small, vertically organized, rigidly focused groups of developers
working on secret code to large, self-selected, diffuse,
horizontal, and somewhat chaotic peer communities working on a
common base of open source code (as, for example, in the case of
the Linux operating system or Apache webserver).</p>

<p>In many other fields, peer review would not be considered a
particularly radical idea. Historically, the way we have gotten
high reliability of results in engineering and the sciences is by
institutionalizing peer review. Physicists don't hide their
experimental plans from each other; instead, they skeptically check
each others' work. Civil engineers don't build dams or suspension
bridges without having the blueprints sanity-checked first by other
engineers independent of the original design group.</p>

<p>Early on, however, mainstream software engineering moved in the
opposite direction (away from open development and peer review) for
two reasons. One was purely economic &mdash; companies producing software
discovered a business model in which, rather than providing
reasonable quality or service, they were able to extract enormous
rents simply by using code secrecy to lock in their customers. The
other was more technical &mdash; software engineers came to believe that
large, loosely-managed development groups were a sure recipe for
disaster.</p>

<p>For many years, one of the axioms of software engineering was
&rdquo;Brooks's Law&rdquo;, proposed in Fred Brooks's pioneering work on
software project management, <cite>The Mythical Man-Month</cite>
[MMM]. Brooks observed &ldquo;Adding more programmers to a late software
project makes it later.&rdquo; Software engineers came to believe that a
project's vulnerability to bugs and problems scaled with the number
of interaction paths between code written by different developers
(that is, as the square of the number of developers). This implied
that projects with many developers should be expected to collapse
under the weight of unplanned and unintended interactions.
Reliability, it was thought, could only be achieved by small
&rdquo;surgical teams&rdquo;, executing rigidly pre-defined specifications and
isolated from their peers to avoid distractions.</p>

<p>Although Brooks did not advocate code secrecy as such, Brooks's
Law seemed to support the practice; if adding more programmers
couldn't help and isolating your team from distractions is good
practice, then why ever reveal your code? The accepted doctrine of
commercial software production came to include code secrecy as well
as the surgical-team organization.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for that accepted doctrine, the reliability of the
closed-source software it produces remained, on the whole,
hideously bad. Even leaving aside subtler failures to get the
intended function of a program right, gross errors such as crashes
and hangs and lost data remained all too common. Gerald Weinberg
observed in 1971 that &ldquo;If architects built houses the way
programmers built programmers, the first woodpecker to come along
would destroy civilization&rdquo;. In the ensuing thirty years most of
the software industry, addicted to its secrecy rents, resolutely
avoided even thinking about whether its theory of closed-source
development management might be broken; instead, managers took the
easy out and blamed the programmers. Software consumers, for their
part, were brainwashed and pummeled into a sort of numb acceptance
&mdash; persuaded that software flakiness was inevitable and they'd just
have to pay extortionate prices for the continued privilege of
living with it.</p>

<p>In retrospect, the infrastructure of the Internet should
probably have taught us better sooner than it did. Almost all of
the Internet's core protocols were developed through open-source
implementations &mdash; and its reliability is extremely good. There have
been few enough serious software crashes in the Internet core to
count on one hand, and the last one happened in the 1980s.  When
you have problems with your Internet access, it is invariably a
problem with the closed-source software on your PC that happens 
after the Internet gets the bits to you.</p>

<p>The Internet is a particularly compelling demonstration because it
is the largest and most complex single system of cooperating hardware
and software in existence. It's multi-platform, heterogenous,
international, and served user populations of widely varying
backgrounds through thirty years and many generations of computer
hardware and networking technology.</p>

<p>The pattern is simple and compelling. Where we have open-source
software, we have peer review and high reliability. Where we don't,
reliability suffers terribly. Peer review is a major reason why
airplanes crash much less often than programs, even though airplane
parts wear out while program bits do not. Aeronautical engineers
(like Internet hackers) have learned to use a design process that
is top-to-bottom transparent, with all layers of the system's
design and implementation open to constant improvement and
third-party peer review. Indeed in most parts of the world such
transparency is required by law &mdash; and where it isn't, insurance
companies demand it!</p>

<p>People who actually write code generally warm to the open-source
idea very quickly once they understand that they can still have jobs
and pay their bills; open-source development is much more productive
and more fun than the traditional closed-source mode, and you get to
have your beautiful source code known and appreciated by your peers
instead of being locked up in a vault somewhere. The defense of closed
source doesn't come from programmers, but from managers and
investors. Our business culture has traditionally considered
collecting secrecy rent a wonderful way to garner large profits from a
minimum of actual work, and thus has tended to treat the defense of
proprietary intellectual property as an absolute imperative. In this
view, publishing your organization's source code would be an
irresponsible sacrifice of future gains &mdash; and, if Brooks's Law
is correct, a pointless one.</p>

<h2>Why Closed-Source Development Is In Trouble</h2>

<p>The problem with the proprietary, closed-source way of doing
software is that, increasingly, the brainwashing isn't working
anymore. The costs from normal software error rates are exceeding
the tolerance of even the most thoroughly acquiescent customers
(one visible symptom of this trend is the exponential trend of
increase in email Trojan horses and website cracks). Partly this is
because the cost per error rises as the customers come to rely more
on their software. Partly it's because the bugginess of
closed-source software is getting progressively worse in absolute
terms of errors per line of code.</p>

<p>To see why this is, consider how the internal complexity and
vulnerability to bugs of a program scales as it grows larger. Both
measures are driven by the number of possible unanticipated
interactions between different portions of the program; thus, they
increase roughly as the square of program code volume. But the
average code volume of programs is itself increasing geometrically
with time (roughly tracking the 18-to-24-month doubling period in
hardware capability predicted by Moore's Law); thus the complexity
of the debugging task (and the number of skilled programmer-hours
required to debug a typical program) is also increasing
geometrically at a higher rate &mdash; much faster than any one
organization can hire programmers.</p>

<p>Thus, traditional development managers within closed-source
shops are increasingly finding that they just can't muster enough
skilled attention on closed, monolithic programs to get them even
minimally debugged. A major index of this problem is the known-bug
inventory of Microsoft Windows, which has actually gone <em>up</em>
in every release since 1995 &mdash; in a leaked internal memo, Microsoft
admitted to over 63,000 &ldquo;unresolved issues&rdquo; in its Windows 2000
release. Over time, closed-source development costs are rocketing
for results that get proportionately worse. This is creating
economic pressure on development managers to think the previously
unthinkable.</p>

<p>In the open-source world, on the other hand, we've found that
it's effective to knock down the walls, expose the process, and
invite as many volunteers as possible to bring their individual
talents to bear on the design, implementation, and debugging tasks.
Not only does this bring in many more well-motivated programmers
and testers than a closed-source producer can afford to hire, it
also turns out to change the behavior of developers in important
ways that lower overall error rates (just as the prospect of peer
review in other kinds of engineering raises the quality bar for the
drawings engineers will let out the door).</p>

<p>The results in software MTBF are dramatic. Returning to our
real-world example: Microsoft Windows machines are subject to frequent
lockups, generally require rebooting more than once a week, and
need periodic re-installation from scratch to eliminate problems
such as registry creep and DLL conflicts. Linux systems, on the
other hand, are so stable that many only go offline when brought
down for hardware fixes and upgrades.</p>

<p>What's going on here is not that Brooks's Law has been repealed,
but that given a large peer-reviewer population and cheap
communications its effects can be swamped by competing
nonlinearities that are not otherwise visible. This resembles the
relationship between Newtonian and Einsteinian physics &mdash; the older
model is still valid at low energies, but if you push energies and
velocities high enough you get surprises like nuclear explosions or
Linux.</p>

<h2>A Brief History of Open Source</h2>

<p>But why now? Why didn't these effects become clear ten years
ago, or await discovery for another decade? To understand the
timing and current impact of open source and some of its larger
lessons, it's helpful to know where and how the method evolved. Its
history is intertwined with the rise of the Internet.</p>

<p>The practice of open-source development began nearly thirty
years before it was named or analyzed. The roots of today's
open-source culture go back to the late 1960s and the first steps
towards the Internet's predecessor, ARPAnet. From 1969 to 1983 the
open-source culture evolved its practice completely without a
theory or ideology. I personally became involved exactly halfway
through that period, in 1976, and remember those early days well.
We exchanged source code to solve problems. We learned how to
manage distributed open-source collaborations over the infant
Internet without labeling the practice or reflecting much on what
we we were doing. We (not I, personally, but the culture I was part
of) were the hackers who <em>built</em> the Internet &mdash; and, later,
the World Wide Web.</p>

<p>Note to all Analog authors (and editors): when you refer to a
computer criminal or security breaker as a &ldquo;hacker&rdquo;, you
are committing a vulgar error that annoys real hackers no end. Those
people are properly called &ldquo;crackers&rdquo; and what they do is
&ldquo;cracking&rdquo;; it involves little skill and less
creativity. The most important difference, though, is that hackers
build things &mdash; crackers break them. For discussion, see my Web
document <cite>How To Become A Hacker</cite> [HH].</p>

<p>In 1983, the hacker community was galvanized by Richard M.
Stallman's GNU Manifesto. Stallman (even then generally known by
his initials as &ldquo;RMS&rdquo;) was already a guru revered for brilliantly
inventive technical work in the late 1970s. RMS's manifesto
attacked closed source code on moral grounds; he asserted a right
of computer users to access and modify the code they depend upon,
declared a crusade against the ownership of software, and proposed
a program of building an entire production-quality environment of
&rdquo;free software&rdquo; modeled on the powerful Unix operating system.</p>

<p>RMS's call to action proved both effective and controversial.
His technical reputation and personal charisma were such that
during the next decade, thousands of programmers cooperated with
his &ldquo;Free Software Foundation&rdquo; (FSF) to produce critically needed
free-software tools like compilers, programmable editors, file
utilities, and Internet communications programs (I was an early and
frequent contributor myself). His choice of Unix as a model also
proved sound; during the same period Unix became the workhorse
operating system of serious computing and the emerging Internet. On
the other hand, RMS's general attack on intellectual property and
the quasi-Marxist flavor of much of his propaganda turned off many
hackers and utterly alienated most software producers and customers
outside the hacker culture itself.</p>

<p>By 1990, Internet and Unix hackers really did form a culture in the
sense social scientists use that term. We had developed shared values
and practices, a common body of folklore and history, a distinctive
style of humor, and an elaborated slang described in the well-known
Jargon File.  This culture (and its sense of in-group identification)
had been successfully transmitted between generations. And there were
lots of us, scattered like a sort of invisible college or freemasonry
throughout universities, research labs, and corporations all over the
planet and including many of the best and brightest computer
programmers in the world. I had been anthropologically fascinated by
this community for fifteen years; when I accepted primary editorial
responsibility for the Jargon File around 1991 I became one of the
culture's principal historians, a move which was to have unexpectedly
large consequences five years later.</p>

<p>The FSF successfully mobilized an astonishing amount of talent,
but never fully achieved its goals. Partly this was because RMS's
rhetoric was so offputting to most of the businesspeople who buy
software and run software companies. But part of it was a technical
failure. By 1991 most of the toolkit for RMS's free-software Unix
had been written &mdash; but the central and all-important kernel (the
part of the operating system that remains resident in computer
memory all the time, brokering requests by programs to use the
physical hardware) was still missing. In fact, development of the
FSF's kernel had stagnated for five years, with no release in
sight. Into this gap stepped Linus Torvalds.</p>

<p>Torvalds was a university student in Finland, who, frustrated
with the high cost of proprietary Unixes, decided to write his own
for his personal computer. But not by himself, no &mdash; Torvalds, then
in his early twenties and a generation younger than the original
Internet cadre, had grown up immersed in the hacker culture and
half-instinctively turned the project into the largest Internet
collaboration in history. In doing so he intensified the existing
practices of the hacker culture to a previously unheard-of level,
and produced dramatic results. Linux, by providing a single visible
focus for open-source development, assimilated to itself the
development efforts and momentum of almost the entire hacker
culture, perhaps as many as 750,000 developers worldwide. Within
two years, by late 1993, Linux became seriously competitive with
proprietary Unix operating systems and Microsoft Windows &mdash; and,
having been developed by the natives of the Internet, actually made
a better Internet platform than any of its competitors.</p>

<h2>The Author as Accidental Revolutionary</h2>

<p>That's when I got involved with Linux. I'd been a happy Unix
hacker and FSF contributor since 1982. Since 1990, as maintainer of
the Jargon File, I had fallen into the role of the hacker tribe's
own observer-participant anthropologist. When the earliest packaged
versions of Linux obtruded on my consciousness it was partly
because they shipped with quite a few lines of code I had written
myself. And Linux presented me with a disturbing puzzle.</p>

<p>Like many hackers, I had gradually and unconsciously learned how
to do open-source development over a period of years &mdash; without ever
confronting how completely its practices contradicted the
conventional Brooksian wisdom about how software should be done. I
had learned open-source instincts, but had no theory to explain why
they led to effective behavior. Linux, by presenting an entire
world-class operating system built from the ground up by a huge
disconnected mob of semi-amateur volunteers, finally forced me to
face the problem. I realized that if Brooks's Law were the whole
story, Linux should be impossible.</p>

<p>After three years of coding and thinking and research, in 1996,
I wrote a paper called <cite>The Cathedral and the Bazaar</cite>
[CatB] in which I suggested that distributed peer review was the
secret of Linux's success, and proposed what I called &ldquo;Linus's
Law&rdquo;: given a sufficiently large number of eyeballs, all bugs are
shallow. In that paper I began a detailed analysis of the social
mechanisms that support open-source development in the hacker
community. In its sequels, <cite>Homesteading the Noosphere</cite>
and <cite>The Magic Cauldron</cite>, I extended that analysis, and
even proposed business models that would support sustained profits
from software development without relying on code secrecy. (The
basic insight there is that in order to live without secrecy rents,
we need to reconstruct software production as a genuine service
industry like medicine or automotive repair.)</p>

<p><cite>The Cathedral and the Bazaar</cite> was written as
anthropology, but (rather to my astonishment) the hacker community
quickly adopted it as a manifesto. As Robert Heinlein famously
observed, &ldquo;it steam engines when it's steam-engine time&rdquo;, and
following the mainstreaming of the Internet in 1993-1994 the time
was ripe. I now believe some close equivalent of the analysis in
this paper and its sequels would inevitably have been uttered
sometime between 1994 and 2000 by someone else, even had I pursued
my original vocation as a foundational mathematician. All it took
was some ability to disregard preconceptions long enough to see the
logically obvious &mdash; a skill I was trained in by reading SF. There
is probably a near timeline, dear reader, on which <em>I</em> am
reading this article as written by <em>you!</em></p>

<p>In our timeline, this work supplied the missing theory to
explain existing open-source practice. Unlike RMS's free-software
crusade, it offered a justification that people could evaluate and
accept without having to change their position on whether
intellectual property was a good or an evil. This energized the
community like nothing had since the GNU manifesto &mdash; and, unlike
the GNU manifesto, it was an argument understandable to
businesspeople and others <em>outside</em> the hacker community.
The effect was to boost open-source hackers and their allies from
feeling like marginalized subversives into being armed and
motivated revolutionaries, ready to break out of their ghetto and
take on the world.</p>

<p>The shot heard around the world in this particular revolution was
the source-code release of the &lsquo;Mozilla&rsquo; web browser at
midnight of April Fool's Day, 1998. Linux had begun to show geometric
growth in market share two years earlier, but only a handful of people
in the computer trade press noticed the early going. It was Netscape's
unprecedented decision to open the code for a key part of its product
line that made Wall Street sit up and take notice. And, incidentally,
changed my life &mdash; because Netscape's top executives pointed at
my work to explain their move.</p>

<p>Since then, open-source development has posed a serious public
challenge to the established software industry. The industry's leading
edge, electronic-commerce and Internet services companies, has
generally embraced the method &mdash; as has IBM, the once and perhaps
future king of the industry. Other major technology companies such as Sun
Microsystems, Intel, Hewlett-Packard, Cisco, and SGI have discovered
strategic advantages in backing open-source projects. Linux- and
open-source-centered new firms like Red Hat Software have run
spectacularly successful IPOs, survived the bursting of the dot.com
bubble in early 2001, and are now demonstrating the revenue potential
from using open-source development to create product and services
businesses.</p>

<p>Adoption trends have been even more dramatic outside the U.S. than
within it.  We can afford the high costs of closed source, even as we
grumble about them; Europeans are less wealthy, and in the Third World
pressure to find cheaper alternatives is intense. Increasingly, open
source fills those needs.  Appropriately enough, the only place it has
not succeeded at winning hearts and minds is where it was imposed by
government fiat &mdash; in communist China the government attempted to
mandate a massive nationwide switchover from Windows to &lsquo;Red Flag 
Linux&rsquo; and failed.</p>

<p>Perhaps the ultimate endorsement came when Microsoft tried to use
Linux as an antitrust defence. At trial in 1999, Microsoft's attorneys
talked up the wonders of Linux in an effort to convince the judge that
vigorous competition still existed in the desktop operating systems
market. The judge, considering Microsoft's 91% market share there, was
unconvinced. But by the Fall of 2000, Linux had passed Windows in
market share on Web and Internet server machines, had taken over
embedded computing &mdash; and looked set to crack Microsoft's
monopoly on the desktop. a development that is gathering steam now
(though, as of this writing in 2003, still primarily outside the U.S.).</p>

<h2>Links To The SF Tradition</h2>

<p>And those connections to the SF tradition? The culture of
open-source hackers is deeply pervaded by imagery and attitudes
derived from SF. I documented this influence a decade ago in the
expanded print version of the Jargon File <cite>The New Hacker's
Dictionary</cite> [NHD]); it shows very clearly in hacker slang,
which is replete with SF references.</p>

<p>While the obvious influences from the cyberpunks of the 1980s are
present, the Campbellian hard SF of writers like Larry Niven, Vernor
Vinge, and Greg Bear has had a more lasting and important influence.
Terry Pratchett, author of the <cite>Discworld</cite> novels enjoyed
by many SF fans with a low opinion of the generic fantasy they
satirize, is also enormously popular among hackers.  I single out
these four writers in particular because, unlike the cyberpunks, they
have frequently been invited speakers at hacker-run conferences.</p>

<p>The worlds of SF and the hacker community blend perhaps most
seamlessly in Neal Stephenson, a writer and programmer whose
acclaimed fiction (<cite>Snow Crash</cite>, <cite>The Diamond
Age</cite>, <cite>Cryptonomicon</cite>) is complemented by <cite>In
the Beginning Was The Command Line</cite> [CL]. This wide-ranging
nonfiction essay on the psychology of computer interfaces was
inspired by Stephenson's observations of the Linux community, and
is in significant part a meditation on open source.</p>

<p>More personally, SF taught me to think of people and cultures as
adaptive machines. SF also taught me that the universe doesn't
respect the neat little compartments human beings like to chop
their knowledge into. Robert Heinlein, in particular, showed me the
value of the encyclopedic-synthesist stance. The cross-disciplinary
analysis I did in <cite>The Cathedral and the Bazaar</cite> and its
sequels was the result of a direct, intentional, and conscious
execution of Lazarus Long's advice that &ldquo;Specialization is for
insects.&rdquo; It is understood in that way by many of my peers in the
hacker culture.</p>

<h2>Lessons For The Larger World</h2>

<p>How can giving up on central control, pre-planning and the
vertical command organization of software development produce
better results? The answer is implicit in the way that cost
nonlinearities associated with scaling change the tradeoffs of
complex systems.</p>

<p>Ask any architect. Have you ever wondered what the practical limit
on the height of skyscrapers is? Turns out it's not strength of
materials, nor our ability to design very tall structures that are
stable under load. It's elevators!</p>

<p>For a skyscraper to be useful, people have to be able to get in and
out of it at least twice a day (four times if they eat lunch). The
number of elevators a building needs to get people in and out of it
rises with the number of people in it, which is roughly proportional
to its floor space, which is proportional to the <em>square</em> of
the height. Thus, as buildings get taller a larger and larger
percentage of the building core has to become elevators. At some
critical height, so much of the building has to be elevators that the
activity on the remaining floor space can't pay for any more of
them. The communications overhead implied by the system's single choke
point (the ground floor) crowds out production. Instead of building a
taller vertical skyscraper, you need several shorter buildings
connected by a subway.</p>

<p>Or, ask any economist. Today's slow-motion collapse of
closed-source software development mirrors the collapse of central
economic planning two decades ago, and proceeds from the same
underlying problems. Command systems are poor at dealing with
complexity and ambiguity; as complexity rises, it inevitably
outstrips the coping capacity of planners. As planning
deteriorates, accelerating malinvestment pulls down the whole
system. In economics, this is the end-stage of collectivism
correctly predicted by economist F.A. Hayek in the 1930s fifty
years before it was acted out in the Soviet Union. In software
development, we observe a similar tendency of planned systems to
complexify until they collapse of their own weight.</p>

<p>Ecologists, too, have learned to respect the kind of
decentralized self-organization that occurs at every level of
living systems. The tremendous interwoven complexity of an ecology
isn't designed &mdash; it doesn't happen because any central organizer
planned a preconceived set of interactions between the different
species that make it up. We know this because those interactions
aren't even stable over historical let alone evolutionary time &mdash;
climate fluctuations, predator-prey cycles, and sporadic events
such as major fires or disease epidemics can and do change the
rules at any time. Nevertheless, ecologies develop and sustain
extremely rich interactions from the unscripted behavior of the
selfish adaptive machines that compose them.</p>

<p>Ecologies, market economies and open-source development all have
crucial patterns in common; they are all examples of what computer
scientist John Holland has called a &ldquo;Complex Adaptive
System&rdquo; (CAS). CASs are composed of selfish adaptive agents
which have only limited, local information about the state of the
system. Their complexity arises not from global planning but as an
unintended result of each agent's search for better, more competitive
adaptive strategies. Global equilibrium and order at each level of a
CAS emerges as what systems theorists call an
&ldquo;epiphenomenon&rdquo; &mdash; organization that is not
predictable from knowing only the rules of the next lower level. The
information that sustains that organization is distributed and largely
implicit in the evolved structure of the CAS itself, not explicit and
centralized in the knowledge of any one agent.</p>

<p>The distributed intelligence of CASs, in fact, is precisely why
they exhibit higher complexity, and cope with complexity, far more
capably than can planned centralized systems. Distribution means
there is no critical node, no single point of failure to be
overwhelmed as the system scales up. Because the agents in such
systems are constantly varying their adaptive behaviors in search
of an edge on the competition, unpredictable stresses are far less
likely to disrupt the CAS as a whole than they would be to
blindside a planned system with planners looking in the wrong
direction.</p>

<p>The flip side of this is simple, and it's the same lesson we
learn from the elevator effect: centralization doesn't scale. Even
if the environment of a growing technological or social or
ecological system is miraculously simple and stable, the escalating
internal complexity and communication costs of the system itself
will eventually boost it into a regime where centralization
fails.</p>

<p>In the end, nothing less will do for dealing with environments
of high complexity than the distributed implicit knowledge and
self-organizing chaos of markets, of ecologies &mdash; or of open-source
development.</p>

<p>The history of the open-source revolution also reminds us that
technological change does not happen in isolation. New technologies
and innovations can go unrecognized and under-utilized for years if
the social machinery to exploit them doesn't exist. Business models
are important too. I've spent a lot more words that sound like
business reporting in this article than you'll see in a typical
Analog fact piece, and that was on purpose &mdash; the lesson is that
open-source development couldn't be practiced at a level
significant to the general economy until somebody figured out how
to explain its effects in market terms and other people figured out
how to turn those efficiency gains into profits.</p>

<p>The subtler lesson is that the full use of a new technology may
demand new narratives, new ways of seeing the world &mdash; and the
technology itself doesn't automatically generate the narrative to go
with it. Without the right enabling theory or generative myth to
organize peoples' perceptions of otherwise isolated facts, even the
most powerful set of innovations may languish in the margins of the
economy for a long time. The Mayans had the wheel, but only used it
for children's toys; they did <em>real</em> cargo hauling with drag
sledges.</p>

<p>Hackers did open-source development as a folk practice for fifteen
years before RMS tried to create a new way of seeing the world
around it.  The wrong explanatory myth (as, in, arguably, RMS's moral
crusade against intellectual property) may actually retard
acceptance.</p>

<p>Therefore, finding the right narrative to help people understand
a technology can actually be a critical factor in promoting it and
shaping the future. John Campbell knew this when he encouraged the
SF writers of the Forties, Fifties and Sixties to celebrate the
exploration of space. I, a frustrated would-be SF author and
aspiring Heinleinian generalist, rediscovered it rather by accident
when I wrote a simple little anthropology paper that rocked the
software industry to its foundations. I have no doubt there are
other technologies out there waiting for their moment, waiting for
the imaginative spark that the SF tradition can provide to liberate
their full potential.</p>

<p>Truly it has been written that the best way to predict the
future is to invent it. As science-fiction readers and writers, and
especially as the proud upholders of the Astounding/Analog
tradition of hard SF, it's <em>our</em> job to create the
generative myths of tomorrow.</p>
