<p>William Shirer's <cite>The Rise and Fall of the Third
Reich</cite> is one of the most subtly horrific pieces of writing
ever uttered. The single most chilling paragraph in a book that
does not flinch from describing Nazi atrocities is this one:</p>

<blockquote>On August 19, 1934, 95% of the Germans who were
registered to vote went to the polls and 90% (38 million) of adult
German citizens voted to give Adolf Hitler complete and total
authority to rule Germany as he saw fit. Only 4.25 million Germans
voted against this transfer of power to a totalitarian
regime.</blockquote>

<p>With this vote, the position of F&uuml;hrer as an amalgam of President
and Chancellor &mdash; the elevation of Adolf Hitler to the status of 
dictator &mdash; was formally and democratically approved by the
German people.</p>

<p>Hitler's program was not a secret; nor were the means he proposed
to use. 90% of the people voted for <cite>Mein Kampf</cite> and the
Nuremberg rallies and the repudiation of the Treaty of Versailles and
Kristallnacht; the mandate was overwhelming.</p>

<p>Since I first published this essay, some people have cited Shirer
to different effect, that Hitler actually gained supreme power by an
act of the Reichstag on Match 23 1933, and was <em>already</em>
dictator at the time of the 1934 elections.  This is a quibble.  The
<a href='http://www.fff.org/freedom/fd0403a.asp'>particular route</a>
by which Hitler was able to subvert the Weimar Republic's democracy is
far less important than the simple fact that he was able to do so.  In
fact, accepting the argument that his coup was only supported by a
minority of the German people would only make the conclusion of this
essay sharper and more painful.</p>

<p>I do not find it surprising that establishment historians and
political scientists have largely failed to confront these stark
facts. For to do so would be to expose the shakiness of the
assumptions that underly our own political system.</p>

<p>The Weimar Republic's 1934 elections wrote a grim and final
epitaph for the theory that constitutional democracy is a reliable
guardian of individual liberty, or even sufficient to prevent
deliberate government genocide of its own citizens. The
demonstration is given more point for Americans by the fact that
the Weimar Republic's constitution was explicitly modelled on that
of the United States.</p>

<p>The American form of constitutional democracy was invented by
the founding fathers of the United States because all previous
systems had been found wanting. The verdict of history since has
agreed with Winston Churchill's epigram that democracy is a
terrible form of government, but eight times better than any
other.</p>

<p>But constitutional democracy itself is not proof against the
short-sightedness and moral blindness of its own people. This is
not a new insight; two centuries ago Gibbon's <cite>Decline and Fall of
the Roman Empire</cite>, the book which effectively founded the modern
study of history, found there its major theme.</p>

<p>What the willful self-destruction of Weimar Germany demonstrates
is that the terminal instability of democracy is not a marginal or
distant phenomenon. A modern, educated, civilized, and cosmopolitan
people in the heart of the liberal West can &mdash; and <em>will</em>,
at the behest of even a single, sufficiently skillful demagogue &mdash;
surrender their liberty and condemn millions of innocent victims to
mass death.</p>

<p>In doing so, it raises a trenchant question. If constitutional
democracy has failed so catastrophically to solve the problem of
government, what system possibly can?</p>

<p>No one has yet improved on Max Weber's definition of government
as an organization claiming a monopoly on the licit first use of
force in a specified geographic region. The question of good
government reduces to this: who can be trusted to wield the first
use of force wisely and morally?</p>

<p>We already knew that kings, priests, emperors, and autocrats of
all kinds have failed this test, as have noble classes and other
oligarchies. We know from the aftermaths of the French and other
revolutions that the sovereign people, unchecked by constitutional
restraint on their tribunes' use of force, can be fully as
arbitrary and vicious as any tyrant.</p>

<p>The terrible lesson of Weimar Germany is that constitutional
restraint doesn't work either. One does not actually need Weimar
Germany to make this point; the history of the U.S. itself should
be sufficient to demonstrate it, at least to anyone honest enough
to admit that the Founding Fathers did not intend for us to suffer
under the weight of a stifling regulatory bureacracy, a
redistributionist welfare state, and the IRS. But Weimar makes a
more persuasive example, because even those willing to defend the
U.S. Government's escalating abuses of power will hardly defend
Nazi Germany.</p>

<p>I struggled with this question for years after I read Shirer.
It's one that throws all the central problems of politics and moral
philosophy into simplifying relief. For reasonable men may differ
on what positive goods governments should aim to secure for their
citizens. Reasonable men may differ even on what sorts of
catastrophe and deprivation governments should aim to prevent. But
it is hard to see how <em>any</em> political arrangement that can
condone the genocidal massacre of its own citizens can be
considered acceptable or sane.</p>

<p>If no government is institutionally stable against the folly of its
citizens, is &lsquo;no government&rsquo; the only answer? Must we give
up centralization of power entirely to prevent future Dachaus and
Treblinkas? This is the anarchist prescription; if we cannot prevent
all violence, at least we can deny would-be Hitlers the mass army, the
machinery of state coercion, the social instruments of genocide.</p>

<p>The Founding Fathers of the United States thought they had found
a way to successfully head off the degeneration of governments into
pathological monstrosities: ensure that the people remain armed,
and teach them that it is part of their duty as free citizens to
check the arrogance of government &mdash; by threat of armed revolt or
by actual revolution, if need be. Thomas Jefferson would have asked
why the Jews and Gypsies of Germany allowed themselves to be
disarmed by Nazi gun-confiscation laws without rising in revolt &mdash;
and, more pointedly, why the soi-disant civilized nations of the
world did not see the confiscation of civilian weapons as a sure
harbinger of the Holocaust to come.</p>

<p>But, in the event, they were disarmed, and thus they had no
recourse when the stormtroopers came to put them on the death
trains. The fatal instability of constitutional democracy killed
over twelve million people. And I see nothing intrinsic in the
American system to prevent a future Holocaust. Especially not when
many Americans seem bent on disarming their neighbors, and
dismantling the very check that Jefferson and the other Founders
were attempting to build into our system with the plain words of
the Second Amendment to the Constitution.</p>

<p>I am left with the bleak conclusion that <em>no</em> attempt to
hold the arrogance of government in check will work &mdash; because a
majority of the people themselves are too easily seduced into
abandoning their own institutional protections against tyranny by
the false promises and poisonous dreams of statist propaganda.</p>

<p>That is why I am an anarchist.</p>
