<h1 class="c1">Why "High Art" is in Deep Trouble</h1>

<p class="c2">I wrote this in September 1997 as a letter to the
"Philadelphia Inquirer" in response to widespread lamentation over
the shutdown of Phildelphia's last full-time classical-music
station, which sent many refugees over to run a half-time classical
format on WRTI, the area's only full-time jazz station. Both the
classical and jazz communities vented a disgusting amount of
self-pity about this.</p>

<p>I appreciate both jazz and classical music, but I'm fed up with
the whining of the people protesting the WFLN/WRTI format change.
Let's face some facts here -- while the jazz and classical
traditions gave us works to stir the soul in past times, they have
become commercially nonviable because their communities <em>chose
to marginalize themselves</em>.</p>

<p>The self-surrender of classical music to a sterile, scholastic
avant-garde after World War I doomed WFLN to the status of a fading
museum of antiquities before that radio station was even born. The
hankering of dance-band leaders to be seen as high artists after
World War II sapped jazz of its vitality. Both genres have been
steadily losing market share for decades because they deliberately
turned their backs on the mass audiences they formerly
commanded.</p>

<p>I would like to see both genres flourish again. I would like to
see two or three competing jazz stations and classical stations in
every city. But for that to happen, the jazz and classical genres
are going to have to somehow break the stranglehold of the elitist,
"avant-garde" thinking that only considers art worthwhile if it is
difficult, inaccessible, or ugly.</p>

<p>In this century the disease of avant-gardism has largely laid
waste to self-conscious art of all kinds. It's time for artists,
academics, and critics to face the fact that <em>they</em> (not the
mass audiences they hold in thinly-disguised contempt) are
responsible. And it's time for those of us who still believe great
art can speak to everyone to dump the elitists overboard and vote
-- with our dollars and our feet -- for great art that is not
ashamed to be popular.</p>
