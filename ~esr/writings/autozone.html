<div id="Content"> 
<div>To: Steve Odland, President and CEO of AutoZone &lt;steve.odland@autozone.com&gt;</div>
<br/>

<p>The Linux community, and the wider open-source software movement of
which it is a part, learned this morning that SCO is suing AutoZone
over alleged IP violations related to its move from SCO Unix to Linux.
We regret that you have become the latest victim in the campaign of
barratry, fraud, and stock-kiting that SCO has been waging.  We want
you to know that you are not alone, and that you have in fact just
made a great many friends.</p>

<p>Our news channels and web forums are already full of people urging
everybody to go buy something at AutoZone, even if it's as trivial as
an air freshener &mdash; that could be several million new customers
for you.  You're also in the same corner with corporate powerhouses
like IBM and cutting-edge outfits like Red Hat Software.  These
companies and others have already set up common legal defense funds in
anticipation of further SCO attacks.</p>

<p>SCO has filed a complaint around allegations that were denied in
public and on the record <a
href='http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20040215015800694#c78161'>two
weeks ago</a> by the former AutoZone employee who led your move to
Linux.  To those of us who have been following SCO's five-billion-dollar
lawsuit against IBM for the last year, this is unsurprising; they have
yet to produce credible evidence or even settle on a coherent legal
theory in that case, either.</p>

<p>Accordingly, we urge you to fight this lawsuit with every effort
you can muster.  It's the right thing to do by AutoZone's
shareholders, and more generally as well.  Thoughtful people
everywhere are seeing in meritless IP lawsuits an increasing drag on
innovation and economic health.  AutoZone can both serve its own
interests and do good by helping make such parasitic tactics generally
unprofitable.</p>

<p>We'll be with you &mdash; and that <q>we</q> includes a lot of
expertise on the technical, legal, and historical issues bound up in
SCO's lawsuit.  If there is any assistance that I personally or the
Open Source Initiative can reasonably provide, please do not hesitate
to ask.</p>
