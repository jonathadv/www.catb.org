development model.  Most developers (including me) used to believe
this was bad policy for larger than trivial projects, because early
versions are almost by definition buggy versions and you don't want to
wear out the patience of your users.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This belief reinforced the general commitment to a
cathedral-building style of development.  If the overriding objective
was for users to see as few bugs as possible, why then you'd only
release a version every six months (or less often), and work like a
dog on debugging between releases.  The Emacs C core was developed
this way.  The Lisp library, in effect, was not&#8212;because there were
active Lisp archives outside the FSF's control, where you could go to
find new and development code versions independently of Emacs's
release cycle <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="ar01s14.html#QR">[QR]</a>.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The most important of these, the Ohio State Emacs Lisp archive,
anticipated the spirit and many of the features of today's big Linux
archives.  But few of us really thought very hard about what we were
doing, or about what the very existence of that archive suggested
about problems in the FSF's cathedral-building development model.  I
made one serious attempt around 1992 to get a lot of the Ohio code
formally merged into the official Emacs Lisp library.  I ran into
political trouble and was largely unsuccessful.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">But by a year later, as Linux became widely visible, it was clear that
something different and much healthier was going on there.  Linus's
open development policy was the very opposite of cathedral-building.
Linux's Internet archives were burgeoning, multiple distributions were
being floated.  And all of this was driven by an unheard-of frequency
of core system releases.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Linus was treating his users as co-developers in the most effective
possible way:</p><blockquote xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="blockquote"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">7. Release early.  Release often.  And listen to
your customers.</p></blockquote><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Linus's innovation wasn't so much in doing quick-turnaround releases
incorporating lots of user feedback (something like this had been
Unix-world tradition for a long time), but in scaling it up to a level
of intensity that matched the complexity of what he was developing.
In those early times (around 1991) it wasn't unknown for him to
release a new kernel more than once a <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">day!</i></span> Because he
cultivated his base of co-developers and leveraged the Internet for
collaboration harder than anyone else, this worked.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">But <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">how</i></span> did it work?  And was it something
I could duplicate, or did it rely on some unique genius of Linus
Torvalds?</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I didn't think so.  Granted, Linus is a damn fine hacker. How
many of us could engineer an entire production-quality operating
system kernel from scratch?  But Linux didn't represent any awesome
conceptual leap forward.  Linus is not (or at least, not yet) an
innovative genius of design in the way that, say, Richard Stallman or
James Gosling (of NeWS and Java) are.  Rather, Linus seems to me to be
a genius of engineering and implementation, with a sixth sense for
avoiding bugs and development dead-ends and a true knack for finding
the minimum-effort path from point A to point B.  Indeed, the whole
design of Linux breathes this quality and mirrors Linus's essentially
conservative and simplifying design approach.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">So, if rapid releases and leveraging the Internet medium to the hilt
were not accidents but integral parts of Linus's engineering-genius
insight into the minimum-effort path, what was he maximizing?  What
was he cranking out of the machinery?</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Put that way, the question answers itself.  Linus was keeping
his hacker/users constantly stimulated and rewarded&#8212;stimulated by
the prospect of having an ego-satisfying piece of the action, rewarded
by the sight of constant (even <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">daily</i></span>) improvement
in their work.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Linus was directly aiming to maximize the number of person-hours
thrown at debugging and development, even at the possible cost of
instability in the code and user-base burnout if any serious bug
proved intractable.  Linus was behaving as though he believed
something like this:</p><blockquote xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="blockquote"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">8. Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer
       base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and
       the fix obvious to someone.</p></blockquote><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Or, less formally, ``Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are
shallow.''  I dub this: ``Linus's Law''.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">My original formulation was that every problem ``will be
transparent to somebody''.  Linus demurred that the person who
understands and fixes the problem is not necessarily or even usually
the person who first characterizes it.  ``Somebody finds the
problem,'' he says, ``and somebody <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">else</i></span>
understands it. And I'll go on record as saying that finding it is the
bigger challenge.'' That correction is important; we'll see how in the
next section, when we examine the practice of debugging in more
detail.  But the key point is that both parts of the process (finding
and fixing) tend to happen rapidly.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Linus's Law, I think, lies the core difference underlying the
cathedral-builder and bazaar styles.  In the cathedral-builder view of
programming, bugs and development problems are tricky, insidious, deep
phenomena.  It takes months of scrutiny by a dedicated few to develop
confidence that you've winkled them all out.  Thus the long release
intervals, and the inevitable disappointment when long-awaited
releases are not perfect.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the bazaar view, on the other hand, you assume that bugs are
generally shallow phenomena&#8212;or, at least, that they turn shallow
pretty quickly when exposed to a thousand eager co-developers pounding on
every single new release.  Accordingly you release often in order to
get more corrections, and as a beneficial side effect you have less to
lose if an occasional botch gets out the door.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">And that's it.  That's enough.  If ``Linus's Law'' is false,
then any system as complex as the Linux kernel, being hacked over by
as many hands as the that kernel was, should at some point have
collapsed under the weight of unforseen bad interactions and
undiscovered ``deep'' bugs.  If it's true, on the other hand, it is
sufficient to explain Linux's relative lack of bugginess and its
continuous uptimes spanning months or even years.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Maybe it shouldn't have been such a surprise, at that.
Sociologists years ago discovered that the averaged opinion of a mass
of equally expert (or equally ignorant) observers is quite a bit more
reliable a predictor than the opinion of a single randomly-chosen one of the
observers.  They called this the <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Delphi effect</i>.
It appears that what Linus has shown is that this applies even to
debugging an operating system&#8212;that the Delphi effect can tame
development complexity even at the complexity level of an OS
kernel. <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="ar01s14.html#CV">[CV]</a></p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One special feature of the Linux situation that clearly helps
along the Delphi effect is the fact that the contributors for any
given project are self-selected.  An early respondent pointed out that
contributions are received not from a random sample, but from people
who are interested enough to use the software, learn about how it
works, attempt to find solutions to problems they encounter, and
actually produce an apparently reasonable fix.  Anyone who passes all
these filters is highly likely to have something useful to
contribute.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Linus's Law can be rephrased as ``Debugging is parallelizable''.
Although debugging requires debuggers to communicate with some
coordinating developer, it doesn't require significant coordination
between debuggers.  Thus it doesn't fall prey to the same quadratic
complexity and management costs that make adding developers
problematic.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In practice, the theoretical loss of efficiency due to duplication of
work by debuggers almost never seems to be an issue in the Linux
world.  One effect of a ``release early and often'' policy is to
minimize such duplication by propagating fed-back fixes quickly
<a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="ar01s14.html#JH">[JH]</a>.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Brooks (the author of <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Mythical
Man-Month</i>) even made an off-hand observation related to
this: ``The total cost of maintaining a widely used program is
typically 40 percent or more of the cost of developing
it. Surprisingly this cost is strongly affected by the number of
users. <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">More users find more bugs</i></span>.'' [emphasis
added].</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">More users find more bugs because adding more users adds more
different ways of stressing the program.  This effect is amplified
when the users are co-developers.  Each one approaches the task
of bug characterization with a slightly different perceptual set
and analytical toolkit, a different angle on the problem.  The
``Delphi effect'' seems to work precisely because of this variation.
In the specific context of debugging, the variation also tends to
reduce duplication of effort.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">So adding more beta-testers may not reduce the complexity of the
current ``deepest'' bug from the <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">developer's</i></span>
point of view, but it increases the probability that someone's toolkit
will be matched to the problem in such a way that the bug is shallow
<span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">to that person</i></span>.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Linus coppers his bets, too.  In case there
<span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">are</i></span> serious bugs, Linux kernel version are
numbered in such a way that potential users can make a choice either
to run the last version designated ``stable'' or to ride the cutting
edge and risk bugs in order to get new features.  This tactic is not
yet systematically imitated by most Linux hackers, but perhaps it should be;
the fact that either choice is available makes both more
attractive. <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="ar01s14.html#HBS">[HBS]</a> </p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s03.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s05.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">The Importance of Having Users </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> How Many Eyeballs Tame Complexity</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
