of 1997 ended with the vision above&#8212;that of happy networked hordes
of programmer/anarchists outcompeting and overwhelming the
hierarchical world of conventional closed software.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A good many skeptics weren't convinced, however; and the questions
they raise deserve a fair engagement.  Most of the objections to the
bazaar argument come down to the claim that its proponents have
underestimated the productivity-multiplying effect of conventional
management.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Traditionally-minded software-development managers often object that
the casualness with which project groups form and change and dissolve
in the open-source world negates a significant part of the apparent
advantage of numbers that the open-source community has over any
single closed-source developer.  They would observe that in software
development it is really sustained effort over time and the degree to
which customers can expect continuing investment in the product that
matters, not just how many people have thrown a bone in the pot and
left it to simmer.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is something to this argument, to be sure; in fact, I have
developed the idea that expected future service value is the key to
the economics of software production in the essay <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/writings/magic-cauldron/" target="_top">
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Magic Cauldron</i></a>.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">But this argument also has a major hidden problem; its implicit
assumption that open-source development cannot deliver such sustained
effort.  In fact, there have been open-source projects that maintained
a coherent direction and an effective maintainer community over quite
long periods of time without the kinds of incentive structures or
institutional controls that conventional management finds essential.
The development of the GNU Emacs editor is an extreme and instructive
example; it has absorbed the efforts of hundreds of contributors over
15 years into a unified architectural vision, despite high turnover
and the fact that only one person (its author) has been continuously
active during all that time.  No closed-source editor has ever matched
this longevity record.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This suggests a reason for questioning the advantages of
conventionally-managed software development that is independent of the
rest of the arguments over cathedral vs. bazaar mode.  If it's
possible for GNU Emacs to express a consistent architectural vision
over 15 years, or for an operating system like Linux to do the
same over 8 years of rapidly changing hardware and platform
technology; and if (as is indeed the case) there have been many
well-architected open-source projects of more than 5 years duration
-- then we are entitled to wonder what, if anything, the tremendous
overhead of conventionally-managed development is actually buying
us.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Whatever it is certainly doesn't include reliable execution by
deadline, or on budget, or to all features of the specification; it's
a rare `managed' project that meets even one of these goals, let alone
all three. It also does not appear to be ability to adapt to changes
in technology and economic context during the project lifetime,
either; the open-source community has proven <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">far</i></span>
more effective on that score (as one can readily verify, for example,
by comparing the 30-year history of the Internet with the short
half-lives of proprietary networking technologies&#8212;or the cost of
the 16-bit to 32-bit transition in Microsoft Windows with the nearly
effortless upward migration of Linux during the same period, not only
along the Intel line of development but to more than a dozen other
hardware platforms, including the 64-bit Alpha as well).</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One thing many people think the traditional mode buys you is somebody
to hold legally liable and potentially recover compensation from if
the project goes wrong.  But this is an illusion; most software
licenses are written to disclaim even warranty of merchantability, let
alone performance&#8212;and cases of successful recovery for software
nonperformance are vanishingly rare.  Even if they were common,
feeling comforted by having somebody to sue would be missing the
point.  You didn't want to be in a lawsuit; you wanted working
software.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">So what is all that management overhead buying?</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to understand that, we need to understand what software
development managers believe they do.  A woman I know who seems to
be very good at this job says software project management has five
functions:</p><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> To <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">define goals</i></span> and keep

sustain the project</p></li></ul></div><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Apparently worthy goals, all of these; but under the open-source
model, and in its surrounding social context, they can begin to seem
strangely irrelevant.  We'll take them in reverse order.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">My friend reports that a lot of <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">resource
marshalling</i></span> is basically defensive; once you have your
people and machines and office space, you have to defend them from
peer managers competing for the same resources, and from higher-ups trying
to allocate the most efficient use of a limited pool.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">But open-source developers are volunteers, self-selected for both
interest and ability to contribute to the projects they work on (and
this remains generally true even when they are being paid a salary to
hack open source.)  The volunteer ethos tends to take care of the
`attack' side of resource-marshalling automatically; people bring
their own resources to the table.  And there is little or no need for
a manager to `play defense' in the conventional sense.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Anyway, in a world of cheap PCs and fast Internet links, we find
pretty consistently that the only really limiting resource is skilled
attention.  Open-source projects, when they founder, essentially
never do so for want of machines or links or office space; they
die only when the developers themselves lose interest.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">That being the case, it's doubly important that open-source
hackers <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">organize themselves</i></span> for maximum
productivity by self-selection&#8212;and the social milieu selects
ruthlessly for competence.  My friend, familiar with both the
open-source world and large closed projects, believes that open source
has been successful partly because its culture only accepts the most
talented 5% or so of the programming population.  She spends most of
her time organizing the deployment of the other 95%, and has thus
observed first-hand the well-known variance of a factor of one hundred
in productivity between the most able programmers and the merely
competent.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The size of that variance has always raised an awkward question: would
individual projects, and the field as a whole, be better off without
more than 50% of the least able in it?  Thoughtful managers have
understood for a long time that if conventional software management's
only function were to convert the least able from a net loss to a
marginal win, the game might not be worth the candle.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The success of the open-source community sharpens this question
considerably, by providing hard evidence that it is often cheaper and
more effective to recruit self-selected volunteers from the Internet
than it is to manage buildings full of people who would rather be
doing something else.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Which brings us neatly to the question of
<span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">motivation</i></span>.  An equivalent and often-heard way to
state my friend's point is that traditional development management is
a necessary compensation for poorly motivated programmers who would
not otherwise turn out good work.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This answer usually travels with a claim that the open-source
community can only be relied on only to do work that is `sexy' or
technically sweet; anything else will be left undone (or done only
poorly) unless it's churned out by money-motivated cubicle peons with
managers cracking whips over them.  I address the psychological and
social reasons for being skeptical of this claim in <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/magic-cauldron/" target="_top"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Homesteading the
Noosphere</i></a>.  For present purposes, however, I think it's
more interesting to point out the implications of accepting it as
true.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If the conventional, closed-source, heavily-managed style of
software development is really defended only by a sort of Maginot Line
of problems conducive to boredom, then it's going to remain viable in
each individual application area for only so long as nobody finds
those problems really interesting and nobody else finds any way to
route around them. Because the moment there is open-source competition
for a `boring' piece of software, customers are going to know that it
was finally tackled by someone who chose that problem to solve because
of a fascination with the problem itself&#8212;which, in software as in
other kinds of creative work, is a far more effective motivator than
money alone.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Having a conventional management structure solely in order to
motivate, then, is probably good tactics but bad strategy; a
short-term win, but in the longer term a surer loss.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">So far, conventional development management looks like a bad bet
now against open source on two points (resource marshalling,
organization), and like it's living on borrowed time with respect to a
third (motivation).  And the poor beleaguered conventional manager is
not going to get any succour from the <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">monitoring</i></span>
issue; the strongest argument the open-source community has is that
decentralized peer review trumps all the conventional methods for
trying to ensure that details don't get slipped.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Can we save <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">defining goals</i></span> as a
justification for the overhead of conventional software project
management?  Perhaps; but to do so, we'll need good reason to believe
that management committees and corporate roadmaps are more successful
at defining worthy and widely shared goals than the project leaders
and tribal elders who fill the analogous role in the open-source
world.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">That is on the face of it a pretty hard case to make.  And it's not so
much the open-source side of the balance (the longevity of Emacs, or
Linus Torvalds's ability to mobilize hordes of developers with talk of
``world domination'') that makes it tough.  Rather, it's the
demonstrated awfulness of conventional mechanisms for defining the
goals of software projects.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the best-known folk theorems of software engineering is that
60% to 75% of conventional software projects either are never
completed or are rejected by their intended users.  If that range is
anywhere near true (and I've never met a manager of any experience who
disputes it) then more projects than not are being aimed at goals
that are either (a) not realistically attainable, or (b) just plain
wrong.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This, more than any other problem, is the reason that in today's
software engineering world the very phrase ``management committee'' is
likely to send chills down the hearer's spine&#8212;even (or perhaps
especially) if the hearer is a manager.  The days when only programmers
griped about this pattern are long past; Dilbert cartoons hang over
<span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">executives'</i></span> desks now.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our reply, then, to the traditional software development manager, is
simple&#8212;if the open-source community has really underestimated the
value of conventional management, <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">why do so many of you display
contempt for your own process?</i></span></p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Once again the example of the open-source community sharpens
this question considerably&#8212;because we have <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">fun</i></span>
doing what we do.  Our creative play has been racking up technical,
market-share, and mind-share successes at an astounding rate.  We're
proving not only that we can do better software, but that
<span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">joy is an asset</i></span>.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two and a half years after the first version of this essay, the
most radical thought I can offer to close with is no longer a vision
of an open-source&#8211;dominated software world; that, after all,
looks plausible to a lot of sober people in suits these days.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rather, I want to suggest what may be a wider lesson about
software, (and probably about every kind of creative or professional
work).  Human beings generally take pleasure in a task when it falls
in a sort of optimal-challenge zone; not so easy as to be boring, not
too hard to achieve.  A happy programmer is one who is neither
underutilized nor weighed down with ill-formulated goals and stressful
process friction.  <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Enjoyment predicts
efficiency.</i></span></p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Relating to your own work process with fear and loathing (even in the
displaced, ironic way suggested by hanging up Dilbert cartoons) should
therefore be regarded in itself as a sign that the process has failed.
Joy, humor, and playfulness are indeed assets; it was not mainly for
the alliteration that I wrote of &quot;happy hordes&quot; above, and it is no
mere joke that the Linux mascot is a cuddly, neotenous penguin.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It may well turn out that one of the most important effects of
open source's success will be to teach us that play is the
most economically efficient mode of creative work.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s11.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s13.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top"> The Social Context of Open-Source Software </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Epilog: Netscape Embraces the Bazaar</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
