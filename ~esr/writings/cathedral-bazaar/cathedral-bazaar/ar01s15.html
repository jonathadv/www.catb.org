Brooks's classic
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Mythical Man-Month</i> because, in many
respects, his insights have yet to be improved upon.  I heartily
recommend the 25th Anniversary edition from Addison-Wesley (ISBN
0-201-83595-9), which adds his 1986 ``No Silver Bullet'' paper.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The new edition is wrapped up by an invaluable 20-years-later
retrospective in which Brooks forthrightly admits to the few
judgements in the original text which have not stood the test of time.
I first read the retrospective after the first public version of this
essay was substantially complete, and was surprised to discover that
Brooks attributed bazaar-like practices to Microsoft! (In fact,
however, this attribution turned out to be mistaken. In 1998 we
learned from the <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://www.opensource.org/halloween/" target="_top">Halloween Documents</a>
that Microsoft's internal developer community is heavily balkanized,
with the kind of general source access needed to support a bazaar not
even truly possible.)</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gerald M. Weinberg's <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Psychology Of Computer
Programming</i> (New York, Van Nostrand Reinhold 1971)
introduced the rather unfortunately-labeled concept of ``egoless
programming''.  While he was nowhere near the first person to realize
the futility of the ``principle of command'', he was probably the
first to recognize and argue the point in particular connection with
software development.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Richard P. Gabriel, contemplating the Unix culture of the
pre-Linux era, reluctantly argued for the superiority of a primitive
bazaar-like model in his 1989 paper ``LISP: Good News, Bad News, and
How To Win Big''.  Though dated in some respects, this essay is still
rightly celebrated among LISP fans (including me).  A correspondent
reminded me that the section titled ``Worse Is Better'' reads almost
as an anticipation of Linux.  The paper is accessible on the World
Wide Web at <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://www.naggum.no/worse-is-better.html" target="_top">http://www.naggum.no/worse-is-better.html</a>.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">De Marco and Lister's <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Peopleware: Productive Projects
and Teams</i> (New York; Dorset House, 1987; ISBN
0-932633-05-6) is an underappreciated gem which I was delighted to see
Fred Brooks cite in his retrospective.  While little of what the
authors have to say is directly applicable to the Linux or open-source
communities, the authors' insight into the conditions necessary for
creative work is acute and worthwhile for anyone attempting to import
some of the bazaar model's virtues into a commercial context.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, I must admit that I very nearly called this essay ``The
Cathedral and the Agora'', the latter term being the Greek for an open
market or public meeting place.  The seminal ``agoric systems'' papers
by Mark Miller and Eric Drexler, by describing the emergent properties
of market-like computational ecologies, helped prepare me to think
clearly about analogous phenomena in the open-source culture when
Linux rubbed my nose in them five years later.  These papers are
available on the Web at <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://www.agorics.com/agorpapers.html" target="_top">http://www.agorics.com/agorpapers.html</a>.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s14.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s16.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Notes </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Acknowledgements</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
