sources of the Netscape client line to the Internet.  Shortly after
the news reached me the following day, I learned that CEO Jim
Barksdale was describing my work to national-media reporters as
``fundamental inspiration'' for the decision.</p><p>This was the event that commentators in the computer trade press
would later call ``the shot heard 'round the world'&#8212;and Barksdale
had cast me as its Thomas Paine, whether I wanted the role or not.
For the first time in the history of the hacker culture, a Fortune 500
darling of Wall Street had bet its future on the belief that
<span class="emphasis"><em>our way was right.</em></span> And, more specifically, that
<span class="emphasis"><em>my analysis</em></span> of `our way' was right.</p><p>This is a pretty sobering kind of shock to deal with.  I had not
been very surprised when <i>The Cathedral and the
Bazaar</i> altered the hacker culture's image of itself; that
was the result I had been trying for, after all.  But I was astonished
(to say the least) by the news of its success on the outside.  So I
did some very hard thinking in first few hours after word reached me.
About the state of Linux and the hacker community.  About Netscape.
And about whether I, personally, had what it would take to make the
next step.</p><p>It was not difficult to conclude that helping Netscape's gamble
succeed had just become a very high priority for the hacker culture,
and thus for me personally.  If Netscape's gamble failed, we hackers
would probably find all the opprobrium of that failure piled on our
heads.  We'd be discredited for another decade.  And that would be
just too much to take.</p><p>By this time I had been in the hacker culture, living through its
various phases, for twenty years.  Twenty years of repeatedly watching
brilliant ideas, promising starts, and superior technologies crushed
by slick marketing.  Twenty years of watching hackers dream and sweat
and build, too often only to watch the likes of the bad old IBM or the
bad new Microsoft walk away with the real-world prizes.  Twenty years
of living in a ghetto&#8212;a fairly comfortable ghetto full of
interesting friends, but still one walled in by a vast and intangible
barrier of mainsteam prejudice inscribed ``ONLY FLAKES LIVE HERE''.</p><p>The Netscape announcement cracked that barrier, if only for a moment;
the business world had been jolted out of its complacency about what
`hackers' are capable of.  But lazy mental habits have huge inertia.
If Netscape failed, or perhaps even if they succeeded, the experiment
might come to be seen as a unique one-off not worth trying to repeat.
And then we'd be back in the same ghetto, walls higher than before.</p><p>To prevent that, we needed Netscape to succeed.  So I considered what
I had learned about bazaar-mode development, and called up Netscape,
and offered to help with developing their license and in working out
the details of the strategy.  In early February I flew to Mountain View
at their request for seven hours of meetings with various groups at
Netscape HQ, and helped them develop the outline of what would become
the Mozilla Public License and the Mozilla organization.</p><p>While there, I met with several key people in the Silicon Valley and
national Linux community.  While helping Netscape was clearly a
short-term priority, everybody I spoke with had already understood the
need for some longer-term strategy to follow up on the Netscape
release. It was time to develop one.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s03.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s05.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Memes and Mythmaking </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> The Origins of `Open Source'</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
