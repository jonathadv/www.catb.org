say they believe) is a fairly complex topic in itself.  All members
agree that open source (that is, software that is freely
redistributable and can readily evolved and be modified to fit
changing needs) is a good thing and worthy of significant and
collective effort.  This agreement effectively defines membership in
the culture.  However, the reasons individuals and various subcultures
give for this belief vary considerably.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One degree of variation is zealotry; whether open source development
is regarded merely as a convenient means to an end (good tools and fun
toys and an interesting game to play) or as an end in itself.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A person of great zeal might say ``Free software is my life!  I
exist to create useful, beautiful programs and information resources,
and then give them away.''  A person of moderate zeal might say ``Open
source is a good thing, which I am willing to spend significant time
helping happen''.  A person of little zeal might say ``Yes, open
source is okay sometimes.  I play with it and respect people who build
it''.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another degree of variation is in hostility to commercial
software and/or the companies perceived to dominate the commercial
software market.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A very anticommercial person might say ``Commercial software is
theft and hoarding.  I write free software to end this evil.''  A
moderately anticommercial person might say ``Commercial software in
general is OK because programmers deserve to get paid, but companies
that coast on shoddy products and throw their weight around are
evil.''  An un-anticommercial person might say ``Commercial software
is okay, I just use and/or write open-source software because I like it
better''.  (Nowadays, given the growth of the open-source part of the
industry since the first public version of this essay, one might also
hear ``Commercial software is fine, as long as I get the source or it
does what I want it to do.'')</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All nine of the attitudes implied by the cross-product of the
categories mentioned earlier are represented in the open-source
culture.  It is worthwhile to point out the distinctions because they
imply different agendas, and different adaptive and cooperative
behaviors.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Historically, the most visible and best-organized part of the hacker
culture has been both very zealous and very anticommercial.  The Free
Software Foundation founded by Richard M. Stallman (RMS) supported 
a great deal of open-source development from the early 1980s forward,
including tools like Emacs and GCC which are still basic to the Internet
open-source world, and seem likely to remain so for the forseeable
future.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For many years the FSF was the single most important focus of
open-source hacking, producing a huge number of tools still critical
to the culture.  The FSF was also long the only sponsor of open source
with an institutional identity visible to outside observers of the
hacker culture.  They effectively defined the term `free software',
deliberately giving it a confrontational weight (which the newer label
`<a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://www.opensource.org" target="_top">open source</a>' just as
deliberately avoids).</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thus, perceptions of the hacker culture from both within and without
it tended to identify the culture with the FSF's zealous attitude and
perceived anticommercial aims.  RMS himself denies he is
anticommercial, but his program has been so read by most people,
including many of his most vocal partisans.  The FSF's vigorous and
explicit drive to ``Stamp Out Software Hoarding!'' became the closest
thing to a hacker ideology, and RMS the closest thing to a leader of
the hacker culture.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The FSF's license terms, the ``General Public License'' (GPL),
expresses the FSF's attitudes.  It is very widely used in the
open-source world.  North Carolina's <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/welcome.html" target="_top">Metalab</a>
(formerly Sunsite) is the largest and most popular software archive in
the Linux world.  In July 1997 about half the Sunsite software
packages with explicit license terms used GPL.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">But the FSF was never the only game in town.  There was always a
quieter, less confrontational and more market-friendly strain in the
hacker culture.  The pragmatists were loyal not so much to an ideology
as to a group of engineering traditions founded on early open-source
efforts which predated the FSF.  These traditions included, most
importantly, the intertwined technical cultures of Unix and the
pre-commercial Internet.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The typical pragmatist attitude is only moderately anticommercial, and
its major grievance against the corporate world is not `hoarding' per
se.  Rather it is that world's perverse refusal to adopt superior
approaches incorporating Unix and open standards and open-source
software.  If the pragmatist hates anything, it is less likely to be
`hoarders' in general than the current King Log of the software
establishment; formerly IBM, now Microsoft.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To pragmatists the GPL is important as a tool, rather than as an
end in itself.  Its main value is not as a weapon against `hoarding',
but as a tool for encouraging software sharing and the growth of
<a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar" target="_top">
bazaar-mode</a>bazaar-mode development communities.  The
pragmatist values having good tools and toys more than he dislikes
commercialism, and may use high-quality commercial software without
ideological discomfort.  At the same time, his open-source experience
has taught him standards of technical quality that very little closed
software can meet.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For many years, the pragmatist point of view expressed itself
within the hacker culture mainly as a stubborn current of refusal to
completely buy into the GPL in particular or the FSF's agenda in
general.  Through the 1980s and early 1990s, this attitude tended to
be associated with fans of Berkeley Unix, users of the BSD license,
and the early efforts to build open-source Unixes from the BSD source
base.  These efforts, however, failed to build bazaar communities of
significant size, and became seriously fragmented and
ineffective.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Not until the Linux explosion of early 1993&#8211;1994 did
pragmatism find a real power base.  Although Linus Torvalds never made
a point of opposing RMS, he set an example by looking benignly on the
growth of a commercial Linux industry, by publicly endorsing the use
of high-quality commercial software for specific tasks, and by gently
deriding the more purist and fanatical elements in the culture.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A side effect of the rapid growth of Linux was the induction of
a large number of new hackers for which Linux was their primary
loyalty and the FSF's agenda primarily of historical interest.  Though
the newer wave of Linux hackers might describe the system as ``the
choice of a GNU generation'', most tended to emulate Torvalds more
than Stallman.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Increasingly it was the anticommercial purists who found themselves in
a minority.  How much things had changed would not become apparent
until the Netscape announcement in February 1998 that it would
distribute Navigator 5.0 in source.  This excited more interest in `free
software' within the corporate world. The subsequent call to the hacker
culture to exploit this unprecedented opportunity and to re-label its
product from `free software' to `open source' was met with a level of
instant approval that surprised everybody involved.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a reinforcing development, the pragmatist part of the culture was
itself becoming polycentric by the mid-1990s.  Other semi-independent
communities with their own self-consciousness and charismatic leaders
began to bud from the Unix/Internet root stock.  Of these, the most
important after Linux was the Perl culture under Larry Wall.  Smaller,
but still significant, were the traditions building up around John
Osterhout's Tcl and Guido van Rossum's Python languages.  All three of
these communities expressed their ideological independence by devising
their own, non-GPL licensing schemes.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="index.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s03.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Homesteading the Noosphere </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Promiscuous Theory, Puritan Practice</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
