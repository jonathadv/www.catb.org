helpful to move from history further into anthropology and economics,
and examine the difference between <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">exchange cultures</i></span> and
<span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">gift cultures</i></span>.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Human beings have an innate drive to compete for social status; it's
wired in by our evolutionary history.  For the 90% of hominid history
that ran before the invention of agriculture, our ancestors lived in
small nomadic hunter-gatherer bands.  High-status individuals (those
most effective at informing coalitions and persuading others to
cooperate with them) got the healthiest mates and access to the best
food.  This drive for status expresses itself in different ways,
depending largely on the degree of scarcity of survival goods.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most ways humans have of organizing are adaptations to scarcity
and want.  Each way carries with it different ways of gaining social
status.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The simplest way is the <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">command hierarchy</i></span>.
In command hierarchies, scarce goods are allocated by one central
authority and backed up by force.  Command hierarchies scale very
poorly <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="ar01s23.html#Mal">[Mal]</a>; they become increasingly
brutal and inefficient as they get larger.  For this reason, command
hierarchies above the size of an extended family are almost always
parasites on a larger economy of a different type.  In command
hierarchies, social status is primarily determined by access to
coercive power.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our society is predominantly an <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">exchange
economy</i></span>.  This is a sophisticated adaptation to scarcity
that, unlike the command model, scales quite well.  Allocation of
scarce goods is done in a decentralized way through trade and
voluntary cooperation (and in fact, the dominating effect of
competitive desire is to produce cooperative behavior).  In an
exchange economy, social status is primarily determined by having
control of things (not necessarily material things) to use or
trade.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most people have implicit mental models for both of the above, and how
they interact with each other.  Government, the military, and
organized crime (for example) are command hierarchies parasitic on the
broader exchange economy we call `the free market'.  There's a third
model, however, that is radically different from either and not
generally recognized except by anthropologists; the <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">gift
culture</i></span>.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gift cultures are adaptations not to scarcity but to abundance.  
They arise in populations that do not have significant
material-scarcity problems with survival goods.  We can observe
gift cultures in action among aboriginal cultures living in
ecozones with mild climates and abundant food.  We can also
observe them in certain strata of our own society, especially
in show business and among the very wealthy.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Abundance makes command relationships difficult to sustain
and exchange relationships an almost pointless game.  In gift
cultures, social status is determined not by what you control
but by <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">what you give away</i></span>.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thus the Kwakiutl chieftain's potlach party.  Thus the
multi-millionaire's elaborate and usually public acts of philanthropy.
And thus the hacker's long hours of effort to produce high-quality
open-source code.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For examined in this way, it is quite clear that the society of
open-source hackers is in fact a gift culture.  Within it, there is no
serious shortage of the `survival necessities'&#8212;disk space, network
bandwidth, computing power.  Software is freely shared.  This
abundance creates a situation in which the only available measure of
competitive success is reputation among one's peers.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This observation is not in itself entirely sufficient to explain
the observed features of hacker culture, however.  The crackers and
warez d00dz have a gift culture that thrives in the same (electronic)
media as that of the hackers, but their behavior is very different.
The group mentality in their culture is much stronger and more
exclusive than among hackers.  They hoard secrets rather than sharing
them; one is much more likely to find cracker groups distributing
sourceless executables that crack software than tips that give away
how they did it.  (For an inside perspective on this behavior, see
<a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="ar01s22.html#lw">[LW]</a>).</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">What this shows, in case it wasn't obvious, is that there is
more than one way to run a gift culture.  History and values matter.
I have summarized the history of the hacker culture in <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A
Brief History of Hackerdom</i><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="ar01s23.html#HH">[HH]</a>;
the ways in which it shaped present behavior are not mysterious.
Hackers have defined their culture by a set of choices about the
<span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">form</i></span> that their competition will take.  It is
that form that we will examine in the remainder of this essay.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s05.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s07.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Locke and Land Title </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> The Joy of Hacking</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
