be immediately obvious.  Many of these derive from the fact that one
gains more prestige from founding a successful project than from
cooperating in an existing one.  One also gains more from projects
that are strikingly innovative, as opposed to being `me, too'
incremental improvements on software that already exists.  On the
other hand, software that nobody but the author understands or has a
need for is a non-starter in the reputation game, and it's often
easier to attract good notice by contributing to an existing project
than it is to get people to notice a new one.  Finally, it's much
harder to compete with an already successful project than it is to
fill an empty niche.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thus, there's an optimum distance from one's neighbors (the most
similar competing projects).  Too close and one's product will be a
``me, too!'' of limited value, a poor gift (one would be better off
contributing to an existing project).  Too far away, and nobody will
be able to use, understand, or perceive the relevance of one's effort
(again, a poor gift).  This creates a pattern of homesteading in the
noosphere that rather resembles that of settlers spreading into a
physical frontier&#8212;not random, but like a diffusion-limited
fractal. Projects tend to get started to fill functional gaps near the
frontier (see <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="ar01s22.html#no">[NO]</a> for further discussion of
the lure of novelty).</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some very successful projects become `category killers'; nobody
wants to homestead anywhere near them because competing against the
established base for the attention of hackers would be too hard.
People who might otherwise found their own distinct efforts end up,
instead, adding extensions for these big, successful projects.
The classic `category killer' example is GNU Emacs; its variants fill the
ecological niche for a fully-programmable editor so completely that
no competitor has gotten much beyond the one-man project stage
since the early 1980s.  Instead, people write Emacs modes.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Globally, these two tendencies (gap-filling and category-killers) 
have driven a broadly predictable trend in project starts over time.
In the 1970s most of the open source that existed was toys and demos.
In the 1980s the push was in development and Internet tools.  In
the 1990s the action shifted to operating systems.  In each case, 
a new and more difficult level of problems was attacked when the
possibilities of the previous one had been nearly exhausted.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This trend has interesting implications for the near future.  In early
1998, Linux looks very much like a category-killer for the niche
`open-source operating systems'&#8212;people who might otherwise write
competing operating systems are now writing Linux device drivers and
extensions instead.  And most of the lower-level tools the culture
ever imagined having as open source already exist.  What's left?</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Applications.  As the third millenium begins, it seems safe to
predict that open-source development effort will increasingly shift
towards the last virgin territory&#8212;programs for non-techies.  A
clear early indicator was the development of <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://www.gimp.org" target="_top">GIMP</a>, the Photoshop-like image
workshop that is open source's first major application with the kind
of end-user&#8211;friendly GUI interface considered <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">de
rigueur</i></span> in commercial applications for the last decade.
Another is the amount of buzz surrounding application-toolkit projects
like <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://www.kde.org" target="_top">KDE</a> and <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://www.gnome.org" target="_top">GNOME</a>.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A respondent to this essay has pointed out that the homesteading
analogy also explains why hackers react with such visceral anger to
Microsoft's ``embrace and extend'' policy of complexifying and then
closing up Internet protocols.  The hacker culture can coexist with
most closed software; the existence of Adobe Photoshop, for example,
does not make the territory near GIMP (its open-source equivalent)
significantly less attractive.  But when Microsoft succeeds at
de-commoditizing <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="ar01s22.html#HD">[HD]</a> a protocol so that
only Microsoft's own programmers can write software for it, they do
not merely harm customers by extending their monopoly; they also
reduce the amount and quality of noosphere available for hackers to
homestead and cultivate.  No wonder hackers often refer to Microsoft's
strategy as ``protocol pollution''; they are reacting exactly like
farmers watching someone poison the river they water their crops
with!</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, the reputation-game analysis explains the oft-cited
dictum that you do not become a hacker by calling yourself a
hacker&#8212;you become a hacker when <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">other
hackers</i></span> call you a hacker <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="ar01s22.html#KN">[KN]</a>.
A `hacker', considered in this light, is somebody who has shown (by
contributing gifts) that he or she both has technical ability and
understands how the reputation game works.  This judgement is mostly
one of awareness and acculturation, and can be delivered only by those
already well inside the culture.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s11.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s13.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">The Value of Humility </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> How Fine a Gift? </td></tr></table></div></body></html>
