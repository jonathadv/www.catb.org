other kinds of tools or capital goods, have two distinct kinds of
economic value.  They have <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">use value</i> and
<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">sale value</i>.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The use value of a program is its economic value as a tool, a
productivity multiplier.  The sale value of a program is its value as
a salable commodity.  (In professional economist-speak, sale value is
value as a final good, and use value is value as an intermediate
good.)</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When most people try to reason about software-production
economics, they tend to assume a `factory model' which is founded on
the following fundamental premises:</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">1. Most developer time is paid for by sale value.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2. The sale value of software is proportional to its development cost
(i.e., the cost of the resources required to functionally replicate it)
and to its use value.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In other words, people have a strong tendency to assume that software
has the value characteristics of a typical manufactured good.  But
both of these assumptions are demonstrably false.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">First, code written for sale is only the tip of the programming
iceberg.  In the pre-microcomputer era it used to be a commonplace
that 90% of all the code in the world was written in-house at banks
and insurance companies.  This is probably no longer the
case&#8212;other industries are much more software-intensive now, and
the finance industry's share of the total must have accordingly
dropped&#8212;but we'll see shortly that there is empirical evidence
that approximately 95% of code is still written in-house.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This code includes most of the stuff of MIS, the financial- and
database-software customizations every medium and large company needs.
It includes technical-specialist code like device drivers. Almost
nobody makes money selling device drivers, a point we'll return to
later.  It includes all kinds of embedded code for our increasingly
microchip-driven machines - from machine tools and jet airliners to
cars to microwave ovens and toasters.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most such in-house code is integrated with its environment in
ways that make reusing or copying it very difficult.  (This is true
whether the environment is a business office's set of procedures or
the fuel-injection system of a combine harvester.)  Thus, as the
environment changes, work is continually needed to keep the software
in step.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This is called `maintenance', and any software engineer or
systems analyst will tell you that it makes up the vast majority (more
than 75%) of what programmers get paid to do. Accordingly, most
programmer-hours are spent (and most programmer salaries are paid for)
writing or maintaining in-house code that has no sale value at
all&#8212;a fact the reader may readily check by examining the
listings of programming jobs in any newspaper with a `Help Wanted'
section.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scanning the employment section of your local newspaper is an
enlightening experiment that I urge the reader to perform for him- or
herself.  Examine the jobs listings under programming, data
processing, and software engineering for positions that involve the
development of software. Categorize each such job according to whether
the software is being developed for use or for sale.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It will quickly become clear that, even given the most inclusive
definition of `for sale', at least 19 in 20 of the salaries offered
are being funded strictly by use value (that is, value as an
intermediate good).  This is our reason for believing that only 5% of
the industry is sale-value-driven.  Note, however, that the rest of
the analysis in this essay is relatively insensitive to this number;
if it were 15% or even 20%, the economic consequences would remain
essentially the same.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When I speak at technical conferences, I usually begin my talk
by asking two questions: how many in the audience are paid to write
software, and for how many do their salaries depend on the sale value
of software.  I generally get a forest of hands for the first
question, few or none for the second, and considerable audience
surprise at the proportion.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Second, the theory that the sale value of software is coupled to
its development or replacement costs is even more easily demolished by
examining the actual behavior of consumers.  There are many goods for
which a proportion of this kind actually holds (before
depreciation)&#8212;food, cars, machine tools.  There are even many
intangible goods for which sale value couples strongly to development
and replacement cost&#8212;rights to reproduce music or maps or
databases, for example.  Such goods may retain or even increase their
sale value after their original vendor is gone.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By contrast, when a software product's vendor goes out of business (or
if the product is merely discontinued), the maximum price consumers
will pay for it rapidly falls to near zero regardless of its
theoretical use value or the development cost of a functional
equivalent.  (To check this assertion, examine the remainder bins at
any software store near you.)</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The behavior of retailers when a vendor folds is very revealing.
It tells us that they know something the vendors don't.  What they
know is this: the price a consumer will pay is effectively capped by
the <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">expected future value of vendor service</i></span>
(where `service' is here construed broadly to include enhancements,
upgrades, and follow-on projects).</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In other words, software is largely a service industry operating
under the persistent but unfounded delusion that it is a manufacturing
industry.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is worth examining why we normally tend to believe otherwise.
It may simply be because the small portion of the software industry
that manufactures for sale is also the only part that advertises its
product.  The common mental bias that regards manufacturing as more
`real' than services, because it produces things you can heft, may be
at work <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="ar01s19.html#WG">[WG]</a>.  Also, some of the most
visible and heavily advertised products are ephemera like games that
have little in the way of continuing service requirements (the
exception, rather than the rule) <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="ar01s19.html#SH">[SH]</a>.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is also worth noting that the manufacturing delusion encourages
price structures that are pathologically out of line with the actual
breakdown of development costs.  If (as is generally accepted) over
75% of a typical software project's life-cycle costs will be in
maintenance and debugging and extensions, then the common price policy
of charging a high fixed purchase price and relatively low or zero
support fees is bound to lead to results that serve all parties
poorly.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Consumers lose because, even though software is a service
industry, the incentives in the factory model all work against a
vendor's offering <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">competent</i></span> service.  If the
vendor's money comes from selling bits, most effort will go into
making bits and shoving them out the door; the help desk, not a profit
center, will become a dumping ground for the least effective employees
and get only enough resources to avoid actively alienating a critical
number of customers.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It gets worse.  Actual use means service calls, which cut into the
profit margin unless you're charging for service.  In the open-source
world, you seek the largest possible user base, so as to get maximum
feedback and the most vigorous possible secondary markets; in the
closed-source you seek as many buyers but as few actual users as
possible.  Therefore the logic of the factory model most strongly
rewards vendors who produce shelfware&#8212;software that is sufficiently
well marketed to make sales but actually useless in practice.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The other side of this coin is that most vendors buying this
factory model will also fail in the longer run.  Funding
indefinitely-continuing support expenses from a fixed price is only
viable in a market that is expanding quickly enough to cover the
support and life-cycle costs entailed in yesterday's sales with
tomorrow's revenues.  Once a market matures and sales slow down, most
vendors will have no choice but to cut expenses by orphaning the
product <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="ar01s19.html#DPV">[DPV]</a>.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Whether this is done explicitly (by discontinuing the product) or
implicitly (by making support hard to get), it has the effect of
driving customers to competitors%mdash;because it destroys the product's
expected future value, which is contingent on that service.  In the
short run, one can escape this trap by making bug-fix releases pose as
new products with a new price attached, but consumers quickly tire of
this.  In the long run, therefore, the only way to escape is to have
no competitors&#8212;that is, to have an effective monopoly on one's
market.  In the end, there can be only one.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">And, indeed, we have repeatedly seen this support-starvation failure
mode kill off even strong second-place competitors in a market niche.
(The pattern should be particularly clear to anyone who has ever 
surveyed the history of proprietary PC operating systems, word 
processors, accounting programs, or business software in general.) 
The perverse incentives set up by the factory model lead to a
winner-take-all market dynamic in which even the winner's customers
end up losing.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If not the factory model, then what?  To handle the real cost
structure of the software life cycle efficiently (in both the informal
and economics-jargon senses of `efficiency'), we require a price
structure founded on service contracts, subscriptions, and a
<span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">continuing</i></span> exchange of value between vendor and
customer.  This is already the price structure of the largest merchant
software products such as ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems,
for which the development costs are so large that no fixed purchase
price could possibly cover them; firms like Baan and Peoplesoft
actually make their money from after-sale consulting fees.  Under
the efficiency-seeking conditions of the free market we can predict
that this is the sort of price structure most of a mature software
industry will ultimately follow.  </p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The foregoing begins to give us some insight into why
open-source software increasingly poses not merely a technological but
an economic challenge to the prevailing order.  The effect of making
software `free', it seems, is to force us into that
service-fee&#8211;dominated world&#8212;and to expose what a relatively weak
prop the sale value of the secret bits in closed-source software was
all along.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This transition will not be quite the wrench it may at first
appear.  Many consumers find that pirate copies of packaged software
(especially games, operating systems, and popular productivity tools)
are readily available to them.  Thus, many proprietary software sale
prices are, from the point of view of the consumer, only worth paying
as claims on other goods: vendor support, or the paper manuals, or a
feeling of virtuousness. Commercial distributions of so-called `free'
software often justify their price to the customer in exactly the same
way&#8212;the only difference is that their vendors do not fool
themselves into thinking that the bits alone necessarily have value to
the customer.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The term `free' is misleading in another way as well.  Lowering
the cost of a good tends to increase, rather than decrease, total
investment in the people and infrastructure that sustains it.  When
the price of cars goes down, the demand for auto mechanics goes
up&#8212;which is why even those 5% of programmers now compensated by
sale-value would be very unlikely to suffer in an open-source world.
The people who lose in the transition won't be programmers, they will
be investors who have bet on closed-source strategies where they're
not economically viable.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s02.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s04.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Beyond Geeks Bearing Gifts </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> The ``Information Wants to be Free'' Myth</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
