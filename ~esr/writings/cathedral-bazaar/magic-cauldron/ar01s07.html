allows us to notice is that only <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">sale value</i></span> is
threatened by the shift from closed to open source; use value is
not.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If use value rather than sale value is really the major driver
of software development, and (as was argued in <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The
Cathedral and the Bazaar</i> <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="ar01s20.html#CatB">[CatB]</a>) open-source development is really more
effective and efficient than closed, then we should expect to find
circumstances in which expected use value alone sustainably funds
open-source development.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">And in fact it is not difficult to identify at least two important
models in which full-time developer salaries for open-source projects
are funded strictly out of use value.</p><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="sect2"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><h3 class="title"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="id2761895"/>The Apache Case: Cost-Sharing</h3></div></div><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Let's say you work for a firm that has a business-critical requirement
for a high-volume, high-reliability web server.  Maybe it's for
electronic commerce, maybe you're a high-visibility media outlet
selling advertising, maybe you're a portal site.  You need 24/7
uptime, you need speed, and you need customizability.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">How are you going to get these things?  There are three basic
strategies you can pursue:</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Buy a proprietary web server.</i></span> In this case,
you are betting that the vendor's agenda matches yours and that the
vendor has the technical competence to implement properly.  Even
assuming both these things to be true, the product is likely to come
up short in customizability; you will be able to modify it only
through the hooks the vendor has chosen to provide.  We can see from
the monthly Netcraft surveys that this proprietary path is not a
popular one, and is getting less popular all the time.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Roll your own.</i></span> Building your own web server
is not an option to dismiss instantly; web servers are not very
complex, certainly less so than browsers, and a specialized one can be
very lean and mean.  Going this path, you can get the exact features
and customizability you want, though you'll pay for it in development
time.  Your firm may also find it has a problem when you retire or
leave.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Join the Apache group.</i></span> The Apache server
was built by an Internet-connected group of webmasters who realized
that it was smarter to pool their efforts into improving one code base
than to run a large number of parallel development efforts.  By doing
this they were able to capture both most of the advantages of
roll-your-own and the powerful debugging effect of massively-parallel
peer review.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The advantage of the Apache choice is very strong. Just how
strong, we may judge from the monthly Netcraft survey, which has shown
Apache steadily gaining market share against all proprietary web
servers since its inception.  As of November 2000, Apache and its
derivatives have <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://www.netcraft.com/survey/" target="_top">60%
market share</a>&#8212; with no legal owner, no promotion, and no
contracted service organization behind it at all.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Apache story generalizes to a model in which competing
software users find it to their advantage to cooperatively fund
open-source development because doing so gets them a better product,
at lower cost, than they could otherwise have.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="sect2"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><h3 class="title"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="id2761991"/>The Cisco Case: Risk-Spreading</h3></div></div><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some years ago, two programmers at Cisco (the networking-equipment
manufacturer) got assigned the job of writing a distributed
print-spooling system for use on Cisco's corporate network.  This
was quite a challenge.  Besides supporting the ability for arbitrary
user A to print at arbitrary printer B (which might be in the next
room or a thousand miles away), the system had to make sure that in
the event of a paper-out or toner-low condition the job would get
rerouted to an alternate printer near the target.  The system  also needed
to be able to report such problems to a printer administrator.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The duo came up with a <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://www.tpp.org/CiscoPrint/" target="_top">clever set of
modifications</a> to the standard Unix print-spooler software,
plus some wrapper scripts, that did the job.  Then they realized that
they, and Cisco, had a problem.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The problem was that neither of them was likely to be at Cisco
forever.  Eventually, both programmers would be gone, and the software
would be unmaintained and begin to rot (that is, to gradually fall out
of sync with real-world conditions).  No developer likes to see this
happen to his or her work, and the intrepid duo felt Cisco had paid
for a solution under the not unreasonable expectation that it would
outlast their own employment there.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Accordingly, they went to their manager and urged him to authorize the
release of the print-spooler software as open source.  Their argument
was that Cisco would have no sale value to lose, and much else to
gain.  By encouraging the growth of a community of users and
co-developers spread across many corporations, Cisco could effectively
hedge against the loss of the software's original developers.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Cisco story shows open source can function not only to lower
costs but to to spread and mitigate risk.  All parties find that the
openness of the source, and the presence of a collaborative community
funded by multiple independent revenue streams, provides a fail-safe
that is itself economically valuable&#8212;sufficiently valuable to
attract funding for it.</p></div></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s06.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s08.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Reasons for Closing Source </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Why Sale Value is Problematic</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
