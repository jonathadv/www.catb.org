value from software.  The difficulty is not technical; source code is
no more nor less easily copied than binaries, and the enforcement of
copyright and license laws permitting capture of sale value would not
by necessity be any more difficult for open-source products than it is
for closed.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The difficulty lies rather with the nature of the social
contract that supports open-source development.  For three mutually
reinforcing reasons, the major open-source licenses prohibit most of
the sort of restrictions on use, redistribution and modification that
would facilitate direct-sale revenue capture.  To understand these
reasons, we must examine the social context within which the licenses
evolved; the Internet <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html" target="_top">hacker</a>
culture.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite myths about the hacker culture still too widely believed
outside it, none of these reasons has to do with hostility to the
market.  While a minority of hackers does indeed remain hostile to the
profit motive, the general willingness of the community to cooperate
with for-profit Linux packagers like Red Hat, SuSE, and Caldera
demonstrates that most hackers will happily work with the corporate
world when it serves their ends.  The real reasons hackers frown on
direct-revenue-capture licenses are more subtle and interesting.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One reason has to do with symmetry.  While most open-source
developers do not intrinsically object to others profiting from their
gifts, most also demand that no party (with the possible exception of
the originator of a piece of code) be in a
<span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">privileged</i></span> position to extract profits.
J. Random Hacker is willing for Fubarco to profit by selling his
software or patches, but only so long as JRH himself could also
potentially do so.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another has to do with unintended consequences.  Hackers have observed
that licenses that include restrictions on and fees for commercial
use or sale (the most common form of attempt to recapture direct sale
value, and not at first blush an unreasonable one) have serious
chilling effects.  A specific one is to cast a legal shadow on
activities like redistribution in inexpensive CD-ROM anthologies,
which we would ideally like to encourage.  More generally,
restrictions on use/sale/modification/distribution (and other
complications in licensing) exact an overhead for conformance tracking
and (as the number of packages people deal with rises) a combinatorial
explosion of perceived uncertainty and potential legal risk.  This outcome
is considered harmful, and there is therefore strong social pressure
to keep licenses simple and free of restrictions.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The final and most critical reason has to do with preserving the
peer-review, gift-culture dynamic described in <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Homesteading
the Noosphere</i> <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="ar01s20.html#HtN">[HtN]</a>.  License
restrictions designed to protect intellectual property or capture
direct sale value often have the effect of making it legally
impossible to fork the project. This is the case, for example, with
Sun's so-called &quot;Community Source&quot; licenses for Jini and Java.  While
forking is frowned upon and considered a last resort (for reasons
discussed at length in <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Homesteading the
Noosphere</i>), it's considered critically important that that
last resort be present in case of maintainer incompetence or defection
(e.g., to a more closed license) <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="ar01s19.html#SSH">[SSH]</a>. </p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The hacker community has some give on the symmetry reason; thus,
it tolerates licenses like the Netscape Public License (NPL) that give
some profit privileges to the originators of the code (specifically in
the NPL case, the exclusive right to use the open-source Mozilla code
in derivative products including closed source).  It has less give on
the unintended-consequences reason, and none at all on preserving the
option to fork (which is why Sun's Java and Jini Sun Community Source
License schemes have been largely rejected by the community).</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(It bears repeating here that nobody in the hacker community
<span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">wants</i></span> projects to split into competing
development lines; indeed (as I observed in <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Homesteading
the Noosphere</i>) there is very strong social pressure
against forking, for good reasons.  Nobody wants to be on a picket
line, in court, or in a firefight either.  But the right to fork is
like the right to strike, the right to sue, or the right to bear
arms&#8212;you don't want to have to exercise any of these rights, but
it's a signal of serious danger when anyone tries to take them
away.)</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These reasons explain the clauses of the Open Source Definition,
which was written to express the consensus of the hacker community
regarding the critical features of the standard licenses (the GPL, the
BSD license, the MIT License, and the Artistic License).  These
clauses have the effect (though not the intention) of making direct
sale value very hard to capture.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s07.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s09.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Use-Value Funding Models </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Indirect Sale-Value Models</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
