services that capture something like indirect sale value.  There
are five known and two speculative models of this kind (more may
be developed in the future).</p><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="sect2"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><h3 class="title"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="id2762262"/>Loss-Leader/Market Positioner</h3></div></div><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this model, you use open-source software to create or maintain a
market position for proprietary software that generates a direct
revenue stream.  In the most common variant, open-source client
software enables sales of server software, or subscription/advertising 
revenue associated with a portal site.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Netscape Communications, Inc. was pursuing this strategy when it
open-sourced the Mozilla browser in early 1998.  The browser side of
their business was at 13% of revenues and dropping when Microsoft
first shipped Internet Explorer (IE).  Intensive marketing of IE (and
shady bundling practices that would later become the central issue of
an antitrust lawsuit) quickly ate into Netscape's browser market
share, creating concern that Microsoft intended to monopolize the
browser market and then use de-facto control of HTML and HTTP to drive
Netscape out of the server market.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By open-sourcing the still widely popular Netscape browser,
Netscape effectively denied Microsoft the possibility of a browser
monopoly.  They expected that open-source collaboration would
accelerate the development and debugging of the browser, and hoped
that Microsoft's IE would be reduced to playing catch-up and prevented
from exclusively defining HTML.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This strategy worked.  In November 1998 Netscape actually began to
regain business-market share from IE.  By the time Netscape was
acquired by AOL in early 1999, the competitive advantage of
keeping Mozilla in play was sufficiently clear that one of AOL's first
public commitments was to continue supporting the Mozilla project,
even though it was still in alpha stage.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="sect2"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><h3 class="title"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="id2762316"/>Widget Frosting</h3></div></div><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This model is for hardware manufacturers (hardware, in this context,
includes anything from Ethernet or other peripheral boards all the way
up to entire computer systems).  Market pressures have forced hardware
companies to write and maintain software (from device drivers through
configuration tools all the way up to the level of entire operating
systems), but the software itself is not a profit center.  It's an
overhead&#8212;often a substantial one.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this situation, opening source is a no-brainer.  There's no
revenue stream to lose, so there's no downside.  What the vendor gains
is a dramatically larger developer pool, more rapid and flexible
response to customer needs, and better reliability through peer
review.  It gets ports to other environments for free. It probably
also gains increased customer loyalty as its customers' technical
staffs put increasing amounts of time into the code to improve the
source as they require.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are a couple of vendor objections commonly raised
specifically to open-sourcing hardware drivers.  Rather than mix these
objections with discussion of more general issues here, I have written
an <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="ar01s18.html" title="Afterword: Why Closing a Driver Loses Its Vendor Money">afterword</a> specifically on this
topic.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The `future-proofing' effect of open source is particularly
strong with respect to widget frosting.  Hardware products have a
finite production and support lifetime; after that, the customers are
on their own.  But if they have access to driver source and can patch
those drivers as needed, they're more likely to be happier repeat
customers.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A very dramatic example of adopting the widget frosting model was
Apple Computer's decision in mid-March 1999 to open-source &quot;Darwin&quot;,
the core of their Mac OS X operating system.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="sect2"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><h3 class="title"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="id2762380"/>Give Away the Recipe, Open a Restaurant</h3></div></div><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this model, one open-sources software to create a market position
not for closed software (as in the loss-leader/market-positioner case)
but for services.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(I used to call this `Give Away the Razor, Sell Razor Blades', but the
coupling is not really as close as the razor/razor-blade analogy
implies.)</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This model was first used by Cygnus Solutions, arguably the first open
source business (1989).  At the time, the GNU tools provided a common
development environment across several machines, but each tool used a
different configuration process and required a different set of patches
to run on each platform.  Cygnus domesticated the GNU tools and created
the &quot;configure&quot; script to unify the build process (the recipe), and then
sold support services and binaries bundled with their version of the GNU
tools (the restaurant).  In accordance with the GPL, they permitted
customers to freely use, distribute, and modify the software that they
distributed, but the service contract could be terminated (or a higher
fee had to be paid) if there were more users at the site using the
support services than were accounted for in the contract (no sharing at
the salad bar).</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This also is what Red Hat and other Linux distributors do.  What they
are actually selling is not the software, the bits itself, but the
value added by assembling and testing a running operating system that
is warranted (if only implicitly) to be merchantable and to be
plug-compatible with other operating systems carrying the same brand.
Other elements of their value proposition include free installation
support and the provision of options for continuing support contracts.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The market-building effect of open source can be extremely powerful,
especially for companies that are inevitably in a service position
to begin with.  One very instructive recent case is Digital
Creations, a website-design house started up in 1998 that specializes
in complex database and transaction sites.  Their major tool, the
intellectual-property crown jewels of the company, is an object
publisher that has been through several names and incarnations but
is now called Zope.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When the Digital Creations people went looking for venture
capital, the venture capitalist they brought in carefully evaluated
their prospective market niche, their people, and their tools.  The VC
then recommended that Digital Creations take Zope open-source.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By traditional software industry standards, this looks like an
absolutely crazy move.  Conventional business school wisdom has it
that core intellectual property like Zope is a company's crown jewels,
never under any circumstances to be given away.  But the VC had two
related insights.  One is that Zope's true core asset is actually the
brains and skills of its people.  The second is that Zope is likely
to generate more value as a market-builder than as a secret tool.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To see this, compare two scenarios.  In the conventional one,
Zope remains Digital Creations's secret weapon.  Let's stipulate that
it's a very effective one.  As a result, the firm will able to deliver
superior quality on short schedules&#8212;<span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">but nobody knows
that</i></span>.  It will be easy to satisfy customers, but harder to
build a customer base to begin with.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The VC, instead, saw that open-sourcing Zope could be critical
advertising for Digital Creations's <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">real</i></span>
asset&#8212; its people.  He expected that customers evaluating Zope
would consider it more efficient to hire the experts than to develop
in-house Zope expertise.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the Zope principals has since confirmed very publicly
that their open-source strategy has &quot;opened many doors we wouldn't
have got in otherwise&quot; [sic].  Potential customers do indeed respond
to the logic of the situation&#8212;and Digital Creations,
accordingly, is prospering.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another up-to-the-minute example is <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://www.e-smith.net/" target="_top">e-smith, inc.</a>. This company
sells support contracts for turnkey Internet server software that is
open-source, a customized Linux.  One of the principals, describing
the spread of free downloads of e-smith's software, <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://www.globetechnology.com/gam/News/19990625/BAND.html" target="_top">says</a>
``Most companies would consider that software piracy; we consider it
free marketing''.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="sect2"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><h3 class="title"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="id2762533"/>Accessorizing</h3></div></div><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this model, you sell accessories for open-source software.  At the
low end, mugs and T-shirts; at the high end, professionally-edited and
produced documentation.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">O'Reilly &amp; Associates Inc., publishers of many excellent
reference volumes on open-source software, is a good example of an
accessorizing company.  O'Reilly actually hires and supports
well-known open-source hackers (such as Larry Wall and Brian
Behlendorf) as a way of building its reputation in its chosen
market.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="sect2"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><h3 class="title"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="id2762651"/>Free the Future, Sell the Present</h3></div></div><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this model, you release software in binaries and source with a
closed license, but one that includes an expiration date on the
closure provisions.  For example, you might write a license that
permits free redistribution, forbids commercial use without fee, and
guarantees that the software come under GPL terms a year after
release or if the vendor folds.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under this model, customers can ensure that the product is
customizable to their needs, because they have the source.  The
product is future-proofed&#8212;the license guarantees that an open
source community can take over the product if the original company
dies.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because the sale price and volume are based on these customer
expectations, the original company should enjoy enhanced revenues from
its product versus releasing it with an exclusively closed-source
license.  Furthermore, as older code is GPLed, it will get serious peer
review, bug fixes, and minor features, which removes some of the 75%
maintainance burden on the originator.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This model has been successfully pursued by Aladdin Enterprises,
makers of the popular Ghostscript program (a PostScript interpreter
that can translate to the native languages of many printers).</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The main drawback of this model is that the closure provisions
tend to inhibit peer review and participation early in the product
cycle, precisely when they are needed most.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="sect2"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><h3 class="title"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="id2762704"/>Free the Software, Sell the Brand</h3></div></div><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This is a speculative business model.  You open-source a software 
technology, retain a test suite or set of compatibility criteria,
then sell users a brand certifying that their implementation of
the technology is compatible with all others wearing the brand.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(This is how Sun Microsystems ought to be handling Java and Jini.)</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Update: in July 2000, Sun sannounced that it would open-sourc
its Star Office, and that they would be selling the use of the Star
Office brand to lines of development of that codebase that pass Sun's
validation suite.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="sect2"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><h3 class="title"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="id2762733"/>Free the Software, Sell the Content</h3></div></div><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This is another speculative business model.  Imagine something like a
stock-ticker subscription service.  The value is neither in the client
software nor the server but in providing objectively reliable
information.  So you open-source all the software and sell
subscriptions to the content.  As hackers port the client to new
platforms and enhance it in various ways, your market automatically
expands.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(This is why AOL ought to open-source its client software.)</p></div></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s08.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s10.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Why Sale Value is Problematic </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> When to be Open, When to be Closed</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
