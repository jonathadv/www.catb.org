grow markets but as a strategic maneuver against a company's
competition.  It will be fruitful to re-examine some of the business
tactics described above from that angle; not directly as revenue
generators but as ways to break into and reshape markets.</p><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="sect2"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><h3 class="title"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="id2825837"/>Cost-sharing as a competitive weapon</h3></div></div><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Earlier, we considered Apache as an example of better and
cheaper infrastructure development through cost-sharing in an
open-source project.  For software and systems vendors competing
against Microsoft and its IIS web server, the Apache project is also a
competitive weapon.  It would be difficult, perhaps impossible, for
any other single web server vendor to completely offset the advantages
of Microsoft's huge war chest and desktop-monopoly market power.  But
Apache enables each corporate participant in the project to offer a
webserver that is both technically superior to IIS and reassures
customers with a majority market share&#8212;at far lower cost. This
improves the market position and cost of production for value-added 
electronic-commerce products (like IBM's WebSphere).</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This generalizes.  Open, shared infrastructure gives its
participants competitive advantages. One is lower cost per
participant to produce salable products and services.  Another is a
market position that reassures customers that they are much less
likely to be stuck with orphaned technology as a result of one
vendor's change in strategy or tactics.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="sect2"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><h3 class="title"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="id2825874"/>Resetting the competition</h3></div></div><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When the development of the open-source X window system was
funded by DEC in the 180s, their explicit goal was to `reset the
competition'.  At the time there were several competing alternative
graphics environments for Unix in play, notably including Sun
Microsystems's NeWS system.  DEC strategists believed (probably
correctly) that if Sun were able to establish a proprietary graphics
standard it would get a lock on the booming Unix-workstation market.
By funding X and lending it engineers, and by allying with many
smaller vendors to establish X as a de-facto standard, DEC was able to
neutralize advantages held by Sun and other competitors with more
in-house expertise in graphics. This moved the focus of competition in
theworkstation market towards hardware, where DEC was historically
strong.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This too generalizes.  Open source is attractive to smart
customers, and to potential allies not large enough to fund competive
development on their own.  An open-source project, pitched at the
right time, can do better than just competing successfully against
closed-source alternatives; it can actually prevent them from getting
traction in the marketplace, resetting the competition and redirecting
it from an area where the initiating company is weak to one where it
is strong.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="sect2"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><h3 class="title"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="id2825914"/>Growing the pond</h3></div></div><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Red Hat Software funded the development of the RPM packaging
system in order to give the Linux world a standard binary package
installer.  By doing so, they bet that the increased confidence
such a standard installer would give potential customers would be
worth more in future revenue than either the development cost of the 
software or the revenue potentially lost to competitors also
able to use it.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sometimes the smartest way to become a bigger frog is to make
the pond grow faster.  This, of course, is the economic reason
technology firms have participated in public standards&#8212;and it's
useful to think of open-source software as an executable standard.
Besides being an excellent market builder, this strategy can be a
direct competitive weapon when a small company uses it to offset the
mass and market power of a much larger company outside the
standards-based alliance.  In Red Hat's case, the obvious and
acknowledged big competitor is Microsoft; standardization on RPM
across most Linux distributions went a significant way towards
neutralizing advantages Microsoft had previously held in ease of
system administration on its Windows machines.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="sect2"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><h3 class="title"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="id2825937"/>Preventing a choke hold</h3></div></div><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In explaining the loss-leader/market-positioner business model above,
I described how Netscape's open-sourcing of the Mozilla browser was
a (successful) maneuver aimed at preventing Microsoft from effectively
locking up HTML markup and the HTTP protocol</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Often, it's more important to prevent your competition from
getting a chokehold on a particular technology than it is to control
the technology yourself.  By open-sourcing, you greatly increase the
potential size of your blocking coalition.</p></div></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s10.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s12.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">When to be Open, When to be Closed </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Open Source and Strategic Business Risk</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
