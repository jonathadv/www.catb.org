development as it happens today, but that doesn't mean there are not
any reasons to wonder if the present momentum of the open-source
community is sustainable.  Will key players defect from cooperation as
the stakes become higher?</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are several levels on which this question can be asked.  Our
`Comedy of the Commons' counter-story is based on the argument that
the value of individual contributions to open source is hard to
monetize.  But this argument has much less force for firms (like, say,
Linux distributors) that already have a revenue stream associated
with open source.  Their contribution is already being monetized
every day.  Is their present cooperative role stable?</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Examining this question will lead us to some interesting insights about
the economics of open-source software in the real world of present
time&#8212;and about what a true service-industry paradigm implies for
the software industry in the future.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the practical level, applied to the open-source community as it
exists now, this question is usually posed in one of two different
ways.  One: will Linux fragment?  Two: conversely, will Linux develop
a dominant, quasi-monopolistic player?</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The historical analogy many people turn to when considering if
Linux will fragment is the behavior of the proprietary-Unix vendors in
the 1980s.  Despite endless talk of open standards, despite numerous
alliances and consortia and agreements, proprietary Unix fell apart.
The vendors' desire to differentiate their products by adding and
modifying operating-system facilities proved stronger than their
interest in growing the total size of the Unix market by maintaining
compatibility (and consequently lowering both entry barriers for
independent software developers and total cost of ownership for
consumers).</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This is quite unlikely to happen to Linux, for the simple reason that
all the distributors are constrained to operate from a common base of
open source code.  It's not really possible for any one of them to
maintain differentiation, because the licenses under which Linux code
are developed effectively require them to share code with all parties.
The moment any distributor develops a feature, all competitors are
free to clone it.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since all parties understand this, nobody even thinks about
doing the kinds of maneuvers that fragmented proprietary Unix.
Instead, Linux distributors are forced to compete in ways that
actually <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">benefit</i></span> the consumer and the overall
market.  That is, they must compete on service, on support, and their
design bets on what interfaces actually conduce to ease installation
and use.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The common source base also forecloses the possibility of
monopolization.  When Linux people worry about this, the name usually
muttered is ``Red Hat'', that of the largest and most successful of
the distributors (with somewhere around 90% estimated market share in
the U.S.).  But it is notable that within days after the May 1999
announcement of Red Hat's long-awaited 6.0 release&#8212;before Red Hat's
CD-ROMs actually shipped in any quantity&#8212;CD-ROM images of the release
built from Red Hat's own public FTP site were being advertised by a
book publisher and several other CD-ROM distributors at lower prices
than Red Hat's expected list price.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Red Hat itself didn't turn a hair at this, because its founders
understand very clearly that they do not and cannot own the bits in
their product; the social norms of the Linux community forbid that.
In a latter-day take on John Gilmore's famous observation that the
Internet interprets censorship as damage and routes around it, it has
been aptly said that the hacker community responsible for Linux
interprets attempts at control as damage and routes around them.
For Red Hat to have protested the pre-release cloning of its newest
product would have seriously compromised its ability to elicit
future cooperation from its developer community.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Perhaps more importantly in present time, the software licenses
that express these community norms in a binding legal form actively
forbid Red Hat from monopolizing the sources of the code on which
their product is based.  The only thing they can sell is a
brand/service/support relationship with people who are freely willing
to pay for that.  This is not a context in which the possibility of a
predatory monopoly looms very large.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s13.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s15.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">The Business Ecology of Open Source </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Open R&amp;D and the Reinvention of Patronage</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
