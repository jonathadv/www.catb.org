open-source world is changing it.  The community's stars are
increasingly finding they can get paid for what they want to do,
instead of pursuing open source as a hobby funded by another day job.
Corporations like Red Hat, O'Reilly &amp; Associates, and VA Linux Systems
are building what amount to semi-independent research arms with
charters to hire and maintain stables of open-source talent.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This makes economic sense only if the cost per head of maintaining
such a lab can easily be paid out of the expected gains it will achieve
by growing the firm's market faster.  O'Reilly can afford to pay the
leaders of Perl and Apache to do their thing because it expects their
efforts will enable it to sell more Perl- and Apache-related books and
draw more people to its conferences.  VA Linux Systems can fund its
laboratory branch because improving Linux boosts the use value of the
workstations and servers it sells.  And Red Hat funds Red Hat Advanced
Development Labs to increase the value of its Linux offering and
attract more customers.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To strategists from more traditional sectors of the software industry,
reared in cultures that regard patent- or trade-secret&#8211;protected
intellectual property as the corporate crown jewels, this behavior may
(despite its market-growing effect) seem inexplicable.  Why fund
research that every one of your competitors is (by definition) free to
appropriate at no cost?</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There seem to be two controlling reasons.  One is that as long
as these companies remain dominant players in their market niches,
they can expect to capture a proportional lion's share of the returns
from the open research and development.  Using R&amp;D to buy future
profits is hardly a novel idea; what's interesting is the implied
calculation that the expected future gains are sufficiently large that
these companies can readily tolerate free riders in order to get the
peer-review effect.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While this obvious expected-future-value analysis is a necessary
one in a world of hard-nosed capitalists keeping their eyes on
return-on-investment, it is not actually the most interesting mode of
explanation for star-hiring, because the firms themselves advance a
fuzzier one.  They will tell you if asked that they are simply doing
the right thing by the community they come from.  Your humble author
is sufficiently well-acquainted with principals at all three of the
firms cited above to testify that these protestations cannot be
dismissed as humbug.  Indeed, I was personally recruited onto the
board of VA Linux Systems in late 1998 explicitly so that I would be
available to advise them on ``the right thing'', and have found them
far from unwilling to listen when I did so.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An economist is entitled to ask what payoff is involved here.  If we
accept that talk of doing the right thing is not empty posturing, we
should next inquire what self-interest of the firm the ``right thing''
serves.  Nor is the answer, in itself, either surprising or difficult
to verify by asking the right questions. As with superficially
altruistic behavior in other industries, what these firms actually
believe they're buying is goodwill.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Working to earn goodwill, and valuing it as an asset predictive of
future market gains, is hardly novel either.  What's interesting is
the extremely high valuation that the behavior of these firms suggests
they put on that goodwill.  They're demonstrably willing to hire
expensive talent for projects that are not direct revenue generators
even during the most capital-hungry phases of the runup to IPO.  And,
at least so far, the market has richly rewarded this behavior.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The principals of these companies themselves are quite clear
about the reasons why goodwill is especially valuable to them.  They
rely heavily on volunteers among their customer base both for product
development and as an informal marketing arm.  Their relationship with
their customer base is intimate, often relying on personal trust bonds
between individuals within and outside the firm.  They do not merely
use the hacker community; they identify with it.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These observations reinforce a lesson we learned earlier from a
different line of reasoning.  The intimate relationship between Red
Hat/VA/O'Reilly and their customers/developers is not one typical of
manufacturing firms.  Rather, it carries to an interesting extreme the
patterns characteristic of highly professionalized and
knowledge-intensive service industries.  Looking outside the
technology industry, we can see these patterns in (for example) law
firms, medical practices, and universities.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We may observe, in fact, that open-source firms hire star
hackers for much the same reasons that universities hire star
academics.  In both cases, the practice is similar in mechanism and
effect to the system of aristocratic patronage that funded most fine
art until after the Industrial Revolution&#8212;a similarity of which
some parties are fully aware.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s14.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s16.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Coping with Success </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Getting There From Here</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
