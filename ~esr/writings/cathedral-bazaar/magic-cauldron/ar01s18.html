controllers, video boards and the like) have historically been
reluctant to open up.  This is changing now, with players like Adaptec
and Cyclades beginning to routinely disclose specifications and driver
source code for their boards.  Nevertheless, there is still resistance
out there.  In this appendix I attempt to dispel several of the
economic misconceptions that sustain it.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If you are a hardware vendor, you may fear that open-sourcing
may reveal important things about how your hardware operates that
competitors could copy, thus gaining an unfair competitive advantage.
Back in the days of three- to five-year product cycles this was a
valid argument.  Today, the time your competitors' engineers would
need to spend copying and understanding the copy is a damagingly large
portion of the product cycle, time they are <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">not</i></span>
spending innovating or differentiating their own product.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This is not a new insight.  Former KGB chief Oleg Kalugin <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/experience/spies/interviews/kalugin/" target="_top">
puts the case well</a>:</p><blockquote xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="blockquote"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
For instance, when we stole IBMs in our blueprints, or some other
electronic areas which the West made great strides in and we were
behind, it would take years to implement the results of our
intelligence efforts. By that time, in five or seven years, the West
would go forward, and we would have to steal again and again, and we'd
fall behind more and more.

<a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://www.everypoet.com/archive/poetry/Rudyard_Kipling/kipling_the_mary_gloster.htm" target="_top">The Mary Gloster</a>,
nearly a century ago. He wrote:</p><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="literallayout"><p><br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/>
And they asked me how I did it, and I gave 'em the Scripture text, <br xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/>

you're really ahead of the game, plagiarism is a trap you
<span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">want</i></span> your competitors to fall into!</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In any case, these details don't stay hidden for long these days.
Hardware drivers are not like operating systems or applications;
they're small, easy to disassemble, and easy to clone.  Even teenage
novice programmers can do this&#8212;and frequently do.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are literally thousands of Linux and FreeBSD programmers
out there with both the capability and the motivation to build drivers
for a new board.  For many classes of device that have relatively
simple interfaces and well-known standards (such as disk controllers
and network cards) these eager hackers can often prototype a driver
almost as rapidly as your own shop could, even without documentation
and without disassembling an existing driver.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Even for tricky devices like video and sound cards, there is not much
you can do to thwart a clever programmer armed with a disassembler.
Costs are low and legal barriers are porous; Linux is an international
effort and there is always a jurisdiction in which reverse-engineering
will be legal.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For hard evidence that all these claims are true, examine the list of
devices supported in the Linux kernel and notice the rate at which new
ones are added to the kernel even without vendor support.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another good reason to open your drivers is so that you can
<span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">concentrate</i></span> on innovation. Imagine no longer
having to spend your internal staff's time and salaries on rewriting,
testing and distributing new binaries for each new kernel as it comes
out.  You certainly have better things to do with all that skill.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Yet another good reason: nobody wants to wait six months for bug
fixes.  If you have any open-source competition at all, they are
likely to bury you for this reason alone.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of course, there's the future-proofing effect previously referred
to.  Customers want open source because they know it will extend
the lifetime of the hardware beyond the point that it is
cost-effective for you to support it.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The best reason, though, is because selling hardware is what makes
money for you.  There is no market demand for your secrecy; in fact,
quite the reverse.  If your drivers are hard to find, if they have to
be updated frequently, if they (worst of all) run poorly, it reflects
badly on your hardware and you will sell less of it.  Open source can
solve these problems and boost your revenues.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The message?  Keeping your driver secret looks attractive in the short
run, but is probably bad strategy in the long run (certainly when
you're competing with other vendors that are already open).  But if
you must do it, burn the code into an onboard ROM.  Then publish the
interface to the ROM.  Go open as much as possible to build your
market and demonstrate to potential customers that you believe in your
capacity to out-think and out-innovate competitors where it matters.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If you stay closed you will usually get the worst of all
world&#8212;your secrets will still get exposed, you won't get free
development help, and you won't have wasted your stupider
competition's time on cloning.  Most importantly, you miss an avenue
to widespread early adoption.  A large and influential market (the
people who manage the servers that run effectively all of the Internet
and a plurality of all business data centers) will correctly write
your company off as clueless and defensive because you didn't realize
these things.  Then they'll buy their boards from someone who
did.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s17.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s19.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Conclusion: Life after the Revolution </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Notes</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
