<p class='notebox'>On 2 October 1999, Computer Professionals for
Social Responsibility presented the Norbert Weiner Award to the
open-source movement. Larry Wall, Brian Behlendorf, Richard M.
Stallman, and myself were invited to accept. I was unable to attend
because my wife was recovering from surgery at the time, but Harry
Hochheiser delivered these remarks on my behalf. This speech has been
translated into <a
href="http://www.yamdas.org/column/technique/cpsrj.html">
Japanese</a></p> <br />

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, CPSR incautiously invited me to say a few
words about social responsibility in computing tonight. And my
first words are these: when I hear someone speak of `social
responsibility', that's when I reach for my revolver.</p>

<p>In point of fact, I don't actually own a revolver; but I do
believe the rhetoric and the very concept of `social
responsibility' have become badly corrupted by political abuse. All
too often, people who invoke `social responsibility' are demanding
that we give up individual liberty &mdash; that we accept just a bit
more taxation, just a bit more regulation, just a bit more
governmental intrusiveness, all for the the supposed good of
society.</p>

<p>The founders of the United States knew better than to believe
that liberty could be traded away by inches to any good end. To
foster social responsibility, they wrote a Constitution and a Bill
of Rights designed to protect individual liberty against the
natural expansionist tendency of governments.</p>

<p>My challenge to everyone here tonight is to remember that, and
to express it in action. If we want to be socially responsible
programmers, our first duty is to defend and expand liberty &mdash; to
defend, in particular, the individual freedoms guaranteed in the
Bill of Rights.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind the First Amendment, no socially responsible
programmer should cooperate with or assist any government program
which censors or interdicts free speech. Or which gives special
status, positively or negatively, to religious organizations. Or
which interferes with the right of people to assemble peacefully
over electronic networks or in any other medium.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind the Second Amendment, no socially responsible
programmer should use his craft to assist with any government
program of firearms registration, licensing, prohibition, or
confiscation.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind the Fourth Amendment, no socially responsible
programmer should assist any program of domestic surveillance,
including efforts to convert privacy from a right to a
government-granted privilege through cryptographic key-escrow
schemes or national identification databases.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind the Ninth and Tenth Amendments, no socially
responsible programmer should allow his work to assist the federal
government in arrogating powers not explicitly granted to it under
the Constitution, and therefore reserved to the states and the
people.</p>

<p>We cannot leave the defense of our liberty to politicians; they
thrive on slicing away bits of it in the name of any pressure group
that can deliver votes. It is the duty of every citizen &mdash; and of
every socially responsible programmer &mdash; not merely to passively
resist the erosion of liberty, but to actively promote and extend
liberty; to enlarge the private sphere; to take power away from
government so that individuals and voluntary groups may peacefully
work out their destinies.</p>

<p>The founders of the U.S. expected us to exercise social
responsibility with the ballot and the bullet &mdash; to defend liberty
with the vote, and with citizen arms if the vote ever failed us.
Today, in a world of ever more ubiquitous computing and networking,
we can use the computer keyboard to the same end.</p>

<p>Go to it!</p>
