<p>ROB: "KDE's built in web browser, Konqueror, can see the
bookmarks made by Linux's version of Netscape. So if we copy the
Netscape bookmarks file from the windows machine into the default
Netscape bookmarks location, it shouldn't have any trouble."</p>

them and delete them, just as if she were still using
Netscape."</p>

apps."</p>

programs, and Internet tools in general."</p>

Windows emulation, or virtual-machine emulation."</p>

a pro, and we're only trying to handle Windows 95. They've had six
years to get that much right."</p>

it under a virtual machine emulator like VMWare, Win4Lin, or
Plex86. It's ugly, but it works at least as well as Windows ever
did. That way we can wean her off Windows gradually."</p>

cable between the two machines. The longest cable we had on hand
was 25 feet. A second hub was called in to make up the
difference."</p>

<p>ROB (VOICEOVER): "10:57PM: Resumed our investigations at snark.
This was the machine with the working 56K connection -- Eric's
custom-built Ultimate Linux Box, which he had installed just a few
days before.</p>

<p>ERIC (VOICEOVER): "11:00PM: While attempting to get network
forwarding for minx up on snark, we discovered that an error in the
configuration of the kernel it was shipped with had silently
disabled its firewalling. Not good. We immediately disconnected the
modem and ran a security check. Then we rebuilt the kernel with
iptables.</p>

featuring dual 1.2GHz Athlons and the fastest disk drives in
production, IBM UltraStars with a 4.2ms seek time. The total kernel
build time: less than one minute and fifty seconds. You may now
drool."</p>

<p>ERIC (VOICEOVER): "11:20PM: The 2.4.9 linux kernel on snark had
an iptables module, but it stubbornly refused to load. After
running depmod -a twice, several recompiles and a lot of reading
source code, we realised that the iptables subsystem in the running
kernel was in fact compiled in. The modules in /lib/modules were
left over from an earlier compile. Clearly, we needed more
caffeine."</p>

<p>ROB (VOICEOVER): "11:46PM: Sugar demanded a time-out for
celebratory cat-petting."</p>

<p>ERIC (VOICEOVER): "11:50PM: Time to tackle Cathy's Windows
address book. To do that, we needed to find where Outlook kept its
data, and how it is encoded."</p>

<p>ROB (VOICEOVER): "11:55PM: A lot of hacking is just wearing out
virtual shoe leather. We flatfooted through the Windows filesystem
looking for the Outlook address book. We figured once we got a make
on that file, a little forensic analysis would tell us what we
needed to know,"</p>

<p>ERIC (VOICEOVER): "12:15AM: The obvious approach - a recursive
find, grepping for strings in the addressbook data -- didn't work.
If it was there, and it had to be there, it was coded in something
more opaque. Unicode, maybe."</p>

<p>ROB (VOICEOVER): "2:15AM: After a couple of hours of this, we
searched Google and found our answer. Outlook has an
addressbook-export facility -- it can export its addressbook as a
table containing tab-separated fields. The only way to get an
addressbook from one version of Outlook to another is in plain
text. We reassembled grelber and used it to export Cathy's
addressbook to floppy. We also discovered that the first line of
the table was field names."</p>

<p>ERIC (VOICEOVER): "02:18AM: Our duty was clear. Write a program
that would translate the export files to whatever format was used
by KDE's address book. For this job, my partner and I needed a
language that both supports rapid development and has good support
for parsing and data structures. A lot of departments use Perl for
this kind of work, and it will get the job done. But my partner and
I thought we knew a faster way: Python."</p>

<p>ROB (VOICEOVER): "2:20AM: Our first step was to write a parser
class that would digest the tab-separated Outlook export file into
a Python data structure from which we could conveniently generate
reports. Fortunately, my partner is an expert at this kind of
hacking; we had our first running version literally within minutes
after he limbered up his typing fingers. Dealing with some odd (and
undocumented) quirks in Microsoft's handling of quotes and embedded
tabs took us considerably longer."</p>

<p>ERIC (VOICEOVER): "2:50AM: Our next step was to determine the
KDE addressbook's M.O. -- the file format we'd have to translate
to. A quick web search established that it also wasn't documented
anywhere. (If Google can't find it, it's not documented.)"</p>

<p>ROB: "Time for some good old-fashioned investigative work."</p>

<p>ERIC: "I think this calls for a sting operation."</p>

<p>ROB: "Right. I'll go undercover as an ordinary user and create
some addressbook entries with known values. You stake out the
location of the KDE addressbook file. Once Kmail writes out the
data, we'll nab it."</p>

<p>ERIC (VOICEOVER): "3:00AM: We collared a sample `KAB'
addressbook file and took it to the forensics lab. The format was
an ugly kluge, but pretty transparent. We begin writing code to
report the contents of our Python data structure in KAB
format."</p>

<p>ROB: "That's `kludge'..."</p>

<p>ERIC: "No, it's `kluge'"</p>

<p>ROB: "No, it's `kludge'."</p>

<p>[PAUSE FOR AUDIENCE]</p>

<p>ROB (VOICEOVER): "03:15AM: My partner and I found ourselves
getting extreme. Extreme programming, that is -- a useful technique
with a really stupid name. One keyboard, four hands, four eyeballs.
We took turns coding. Generating something the KDE addressbook
application will read turned out to be a tougher job than we
thought. The address data had mostly been wedged into the `custom'
extension field of a file format that had been originally designed
for something else. Something called QConfigDB. The resulting mess
was not pretty."</p>

<p>ERIC (VOICEOVER): "05:00AM: We had been at it for nearly four
hours. What our script produced looked right but the KDE
addressbook application wouldn't read it. We were getting stale --
stale enough that the Dr. Peppers weren't helping anymore. We
decided to work on something else."</p>

<p>ROB (VOICEOVER): "05:05AM: StarOffice. It seemed to be our best
hope of solving the Word problem. We went to the Sun Microsystems
site to download it. The web form wanted to us to tell Sun a few
things first. Name. Address. Organization. We start typing and
clicking."</p>

<p>ERIC (VOICEOVER): "05:07AM: A box near the bottom of the third
page of the web form wants to know if Sun can send us marketing
spam. We tell it no."</p>

<p>ROB (VOICEOVER): "05:10AM. We're still typing. Number of
employees at this location. Mother's maiden name. Somewhere around
the sixth page of the web form Sun asks a second time if they can
send us spam. We tell it no."</p>

<p>ERIC (VOICEOVER): "05:20AM: We're still answering questions.
Favorite color. Capitol of North Dakota. Blood type. Airspeed of an
unladen African swallow. Somewhere around the fifteenth page of the
web form Sun asks a third time if they can please send us spam. We
tell it no."</p>

<p>[PAUSE FOR AUDIENCE]</p>

through a 56K modem, and StarOffice is bigger than Mozilla. At 4K a
second, it's going to take a while. We're talking hours. Time to
get some sleep. My partner and I call it a night. I head for the
daybed in the basement."</p>

o'clock in the mirning?"</p>

to edit Word documents with, and that's going to take about four
hours over 56K."</p>
