<P>The early growth of Linux synergized with another phenomenon: the public
discovery of the Internet.  The early 1990s also saw the beginnings 
of a flourishing Internet-provider industry, selling connectivity to
the public for a few dollars a month.  Following the invention of the
World-Wide Web, the Internet's already-rapid growth accelerated to a
breakneck pace. 
<P>By 1994, the year Berkeley's Unix development group formally shut down, 
several different free Unix versions (Linux and the descendants of
386BSD) served as the major focal points of hacking activity.  Linux
was being distributed commercially on CD-ROM and selling like hotcakes.
By the end of 1995, major computer companies were beginning to take out
glossy advertisements celebrating the Internet-friendliness of their
software and hardware! 
<P>In the late 1990s the central activities of hackerdom became Linux
development and the mainstreaming of the Internet.  The World Wide Web
has at last made the Internet into a mass medium, and many of the hackers
of the 1980s and early 1990s launched Internet Service Providers selling
or giving access to the masses. 
<P>The mainstreaming of the Internet even brought the hacker culture the
beginnings of respectability and political clout.  In 1994 and 1995
hacker activism scuppered the Clipper proposal which would have put
strong encryption under government control.  In 1996 hackers mobilized
a broad coalition to defeat the misnamed ``Communications Decency
Act'' and prevent censorship of the Internet.
<P>With the CDA victory, we pass out of history into current events.  We
also pass into a period in which your historian (rather to his own
surprise) became an actor rather than just an observer.  This
narrative will continue in <EM>Revenge of the Hackers</EM>.
