run as a deliberate test of the surprising theories about software
engineering suggested by the history of Linux.  I discuss these
theories in terms of two fundamentally different development styles,
the ``cathedral'' model of most of the commercial world versus the ``bazaar''
model of the Linux world.  I show that these models derive from
opposing assumptions about the nature of the software-debugging task.
I then make a sustained argument from the Linux experience for the
proposition that ``Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow'',
suggest productive analogies with other self-correcting systems of
selfish agents, and conclude with some exploration of the implications
of this insight for the future of software.</p></div></div><hr xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="toc"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><b>Table of Contents</b></p><dl><dt><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="index.html#catbmain">The Cathedral and the Bazaar</a></dt><dt><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="ar01s02.html">The Mail Must Get Through</a></dt><dt><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="ar01s03.html">The Importance of Having Users</a></dt><dt><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="ar01s04.html"> Release Early, Release Often</a></dt><dt><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="ar01s05.html">How Many Eyeballs Tame Complexity</a></dt><dt><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="ar01s06.html">When Is a Rose Not a Rose?</a></dt><dt><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="ar01s07.html">Popclient becomes Fetchmail</a></dt><dt><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="ar01s08.html">Fetchmail Grows Up</a></dt><dt><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="ar01s09.html">A Few More Lessons from Fetchmail</a></dt><dt><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="ar01s10.html"> Necessary Preconditions for the Bazaar Style</a></dt><dt><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="ar01s11.html"> The Social Context of Open-Source Software</a></dt><dt><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="ar01s12.html">On Management and the Maginot Line</a></dt><dt><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="ar01s13.html">Epilog: Netscape Embraces the Bazaar</a></dt><dt><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="ar01s14.html">Notes</a></dt><dt><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="ar01s15.html">Bibliography</a></dt><dt><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="ar01s16.html">Acknowledgements</a></dt></dl></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="sect1"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="catbmain"/>The Cathedral and the Bazaar</h2></div></div><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Linux is subversive.  Who would have thought even five years ago
(1991) that a world-class operating system could coalesce as if by
magic out of part-time hacking by several thousand developers
scattered all over the planet, connected only by the tenuous strands
of the Internet?</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Certainly not I. By the time Linux swam onto my radar screen in early
1993, I had already been involved in Unix and open-source development
for ten years.  I was one of the first GNU contributors in the
mid-1980s.  I had released a good deal of open-source software onto
the net, developing or co-developing several programs (nethack, Emacs's
VC and GUD modes, xlife, and others) that are still in wide use today.
I thought I knew how it was done.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Linux overturned much of what I thought I knew.  I had been preaching
the Unix gospel of small tools, rapid prototyping and evolutionary
programming for years.  But I also believed there was a certain
critical complexity above which a more centralized, a priori approach
was required.  I believed that the most important software (operating
systems and really large tools like the Emacs programming editor)
needed to be built like cathedrals, carefully crafted by individual
wizards or small bands of mages working in splendid isolation, with no
beta to be released before its time.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Linus Torvalds's style of development&#8212;release early and
often, delegate everything you can, be open to the point of
promiscuity&#8212;came as a surprise.  No quiet, reverent
cathedral-building here&#8212;rather, the Linux community seemed to
resemble a great babbling bazaar of differing agendas and approaches
(aptly symbolized by the Linux archive sites, who'd take submissions
from <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">anyone</i></span>) out of which a coherent and stable
system could seemingly emerge only by a succession of miracles.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The fact that this bazaar style seemed to work, and work well,
came as a distinct shock.  As I learned my way around, I worked hard
not just at individual projects, but also at trying to understand why
the Linux world not only didn't fly apart in confusion but seemed to
go from strength to strength at a speed barely imaginable to
cathedral-builders.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By mid-1996 I thought I was beginning to understand.  Chance
handed me a perfect way to test my theory, in the form of an
open-source project that I could consciously try to run in the bazaar
style.  So I did&#8212;and it was a significant success.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This is the story of that project.  I'll use it to propose some
aphorisms about effective open-source development.  Not all of these
are things I first learned in the Linux world, but we'll see how the
Linux world gives them particular point.  If I'm correct, they'll help
you understand exactly what it is that makes the Linux community such
a fountain of good software&#8212;and, perhaps, they will help you become
more productive yourself.</p></div></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s02.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top"> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> The Mail Must Get Through</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
