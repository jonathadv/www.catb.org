<div class=notebox><p>An open letter to Scott McNealy, CEO of Sun,
responding to remarks at Sun's February 2004 analyst meeting.</p>

<p>A <a href='http://www.opensource.nl/esr-on-java.html'>Dutch
translation</a> is available,</p></div>

<p>The open-source community has been hearing <a
href='http://zdnet.com.com/2100-1104_2-5157655.html'>reports</a> that
you have recently said of Sun Microsystem's strategy "The open-source
model is our friend".  We're glad to hear that, and Sun's support of
OpenOffice.org certainly puts some weight behind the claim.  But that
support is curiously inconsistent, spotty in ways which suggests that
Sun is confused in the way it thinks about and executes its
open-source strategy.</p>

<p>That confusion is evident in another of your quotes.  Many of us think
you are right on when you say that "Sun [...] is less threatened by a
zero-revenue model for software than just about anybody out there."
We agree that the potential for you in using open-source software as a
value multiplier for Sun's hardware business is huge.  This wouldn't
even be a novel move for Sun; your release of the NFS standards in
1984 was possibly the single most successful market-shaping maneuver
in your company's history, and we'd love to help you repeat it.</p>

<p>But the casual equation between "open source" and "zero revenue"
suggests that on another level you don't really know what you're
talking about.  Open source is hardly a zero-revenue model; ask Red
Hat, which had a share price over triple Sun's when I just checked.
Or ask IBM, which is using Linux as a lever to build a huge
systems-integration business in markets like financial services that
Sun has historically owned.</p>

<p>It doesn't have to be this way. If Sun were prepared to go all the way
with open source it could seize back its position of industry
leadership. Sun is one of a small handful of companies that would both
have the smarts and the street cred to do even better than IBM has
from a full-fledged alliance with the open-source community.  Indeed,
on historical grounds you might do better; many of the senior people
in the movement are old-time Unix hackers who remember that Sun was
founded by geeks like us at a time when IBM was the Great Satan.</p>

<p>But Sun has done other things that make us wonder if the vision and
courage to choose the open-source path are really there.  The
suspicion persists that OpenOffice.org is just an expedient way to
poke Microsoft in the eye, not the cutting edge of a
open-source-friendly strategy that will position Sun for the future.
Matters aren't helped by the fact that Sun appears, with Microsoft, to
be one of the two companies doing most to stuff SCO's war chest for
its attack on Linux.</p>

<p>In 1987, three years after the success of NFS, Sun lost the war to
define the standard graphics interface for the next generation.  The
winner, the X Window System, was technically inferior to Sun's NeWS
offering.  But X had one critical advantage; it was open source.  Ten
years later in 1997, when Bill Joy came to a Linux conference to push
Jini as a universal network-service protocol, we in the open-source
community told him straight up "You can have ubiquity or you can have
control.  Pick one." He picked control, and Jini failed in its promise.
The contrast with NFS could hardly be more stark.</p>

<p>Today, the big issue is Java.  Sun's insistence on continuing tight
control of the Java code has damaged Sun's long-term interests by
throttling acceptance of the language in the open-source community,
ceding the field (and probably the future) to scripting-language
competitors like Python and Perl.  Once again the choice is between
control and ubiquity, and despite your claim that "open source is our
friend" Sun appears to be choosing control.  Sun's terms are so
restrictive that Linux distributions cannot even include Java binaries
for use as a browser plugin, let alone as a standalone development
tool.</p>

<p>Mr. CEO, tear down that wall.  You have millions of potential allies
out here in the open-source community who would love to become Java
developers and users if it didn't mean ceding control of their future
to Sun.  If you're serious about being a friend of open source, if
you're serious about preparing Sun for the future we can all see
coming in which code secrecy and proprietary lock-in will no longer be
viable strategies, prove it.  Let Java go.</p>

<p>I have written a <a href='let-java-go-2.html'>followup</a> to this letter.</p>

<p>Note: This letter has attracted a lot of half-bright criticism to
the effect that I should have compared Sun and Red Hat by market
capitalization rather than share price.  Wrong.  Market cap measures
present value; the relative prices investors are willing to pay for
shares (not the company's asking price) reflect their expectations of
future return <em>per their invested dollar</em> (that last
qualification is what normalizes share volume out of the equation).
I'm informed that this effect is particularly visible in IPOs and
derivative trades, though my informant thinks prices of established
stocks are too noisy for it to be reliable there.</p>
