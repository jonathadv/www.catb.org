speed isn't that important.  But nobody is going to buy a 386/25 (or
even 386/50) at this point; if nothing else, you want to get a newer
motherboard so you can put this week's flavor of RAM module on it. And
who knows?  Maybe (you tell yourself) you <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">will</i></span>
end up doing realtime 3D graphics or nuclear-explosion modelling or
one of the handful of applications that can really strain your
processor.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">So for all you processor-speed junkies out there who want to be
able to wave around megahertz figures like gearheads bragging
abut the compression ratios in their hot-rods, here's a simple rule:</p><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Do</i></span> buy one or two levels lower
than commercial state of the art.</p></li></ul></div><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In December 1996, if you look at a typical clone-maker's
advertisement, you'll see that the top three systems are a Pentium
Pro, a Pentium 166, and a Pentium 133.  The rule of thumb tells us
to skip the Pentium Pro, consider the Pentium 166, and look seriously
at the 133.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Why?  Because of the way manufacturers' price-performance curves are
shaped.  The top-of-line system is generally boob bait for corporate
executives and other people with more money than sense.  Chances are
the system design is new and untried -- if you're at the wrong point
in the technology cycle, the chip may even be a pre-production sample,
or an early production stepping with undiscovered bugs like the
infamous Pentium FDIV problem.  You don't need such troubles.  Better
to go with a chip/motherboard combination that's been out for a while
and is known good.  It's not like you really need the extra speed,
after all.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Besides, if you buy one of these gold-plated systems, you're only
going to kick yourself three months later when the price plunges by
30%.  Further down the product line there's been more real competition
and the manufacturer's margins are already squeezed.  There's less
room for prices to fall, so you won't watch your new toy lose street
value so fast.  Its price will still drop, but it won't plummet 
sickeningly.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Again, bear in mind that the cheapest processor you can buy new today
is plenty fast enough for Linux.  So if dropping back to a Pentium 90
or 75 will bring you in under budget, you can do it with no regrets.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s02.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s04.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top"> What To Optimize </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">  One Disk or Two?</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
