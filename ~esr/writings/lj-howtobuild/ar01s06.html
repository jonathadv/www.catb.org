bus and processor and video.  The rest is easier, and less dependent
on the peculiarities of Linux.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Next in importance is your CD-ROM drive (you'll almost certainly
be installing your Linux from it!).  You have a SCSI system, so get a
SCSI CD-ROM.  That's pretty much the end of spec, as SCSI CD-ROMs are
a very generic item.  The only significant price driver is their speed
-- 6x, 8x, 10x, or up (it's hard to find 2x or 4x speeds
anymore).</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Again, bear in mind that you probably don't need the latest and
greatest.  High-speed CD-ROMS are really designed for people playing
CD-ROM games or other applications involving image and sound archives.
If you're doing the Linux thing, chances are you'll primarily use
CD-ROMs that are code archives.  Your average transfer size will be
small and an apparent speed of 6x or even 4x quite satisfactory.  So
here's a place to cut costs by buying well behind the leading
edge.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Next, consider a backup device.  This is another place where spending
extra money pays.  Cheap tape drives are unreliable, noisy and have
agonizingly slow transfer speeds.  It's no fun to listen to what
sounds like a blender dicing celery for twenty minutes while your disk
is backed up, so with the cheap drives you'll quickly find you're
backing up less often than you really should.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The worst are the QIC mini-cartridge drives, including the new Travan
technology. But they're also the cheapest, and thus exactly what
clonemakers tend to bundle and salespeople to push.  Avoid these.
Quarter-inch QIC drives are less nasty (mainly because they have
higher transfer speed and get done quicker; also they're usually
engineered better for reliability).  But you really want to pay for a
DAT or DLT drive.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of course buy 16MB of memory, unless you really like a text-only
console -- X is not comfortable when memory is tight.  Having lots
of free memory will also improve your virtual-memory performance.
Fortunately, with RAM as cheap as it is now this is unlikely to
bust your budget.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">You'll also want a three-button serial mouse.  I happen to like 
the three-button Logitech MouseMan and its kin, just the thing for
a hacker's chronically cluttered desktop.  Your mileage may vary.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">You'll want a modem, of course. 28.8 for speediest possible net
surfing.  How to buy a modem could be in an article in itself; we
won't try to cover it here.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The rest is basically frills and freebies.  You can get a sound card
if you like, though under Linux you're not likely to use it for
anything but playing Doom.  Every system sold today has the requisite
two floppy drives and two serial ports and one parallel port.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">And that about does it for basic hardware.  Later on we'll look at
some actual system configurations.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s05.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s07.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Monitor And Video </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">  Some Pitfalls To Avoid.</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
