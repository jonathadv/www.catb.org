whether of the newer variety called &quot;Plug'n'Play&quot; or the older kind
that requires a DOS utility to poke registers in the card at bootup
time.  These will cause you no end of grief.  Plug'n'Play isn't yet
supported under Linux as I write, and it would be totally nasty to
have to boot DOS first every time you want to run Linux.  (A lot of
these cards don't even hold their settings across a warm boot.)</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">You need to be extra-vigilant about this when buying.  The tiny, 
reptilian brains of most computer salespeople cannot seem to encompass
the existence of clone-box OSs other than DOS or Windows.  They think
boot-time setup utilities are just fine and jumperless cards are the
best things since sliced bread (easier to set up and a whole fifty
cents cheaper too!).  So they'll push jumperless cards at you with
glee and abandon.  Foil them, or you'll suffer for it later.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Don't</i></span> buy so-called &quot;WinModems&quot; or anything that
advertises &quot;RPI&quot; or &quot;Rockwell Peripheral Interface&quot; on the box.  These
are ways for manufacturers to save a few bucks on firmware at your
expense; they won't work without driver software that runs only under
Windows.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Don't</i></span> get stuck with a 2-button mouse.
