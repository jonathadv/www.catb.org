<div id="Content">

<p>A few days ago I uttered a <a href="cups-horror.html">rant</a> on
user-interface problems in the Common Unix Printing System.  I used it
to develop the idea that the most valuable gift you can give your
users is the luxury of ignorance &mdash; software that works so well, 
and is so discoverable to even novice users, that they don't have to
read documentation or spend time and mental effort to learn about
it.</p>

<p>This rant made it onto all the major open-source news channels, so
I was expecting a fair amount of feedback (and maybe pushback).  But
the volume of community reaction that thundered into my mailbox far
surpassed what I had been expecting &mdash; and the dominant theme,
too, was a bit of a surprise.  Not the hundreds of iterations of "Tell
it, brother!", nor the handful of people who excoriated me as an
arrogant twerp; those are both normal features of the response when I
fire a broadside.  No, the really interesting part was how many of the
letters said. in effect, "Gee.  And all this time I thought it was
just me..."</p>

<p>Here are representative excerpts.  Hostnames have been removed to
guard respondents' privacy.   A few typos and punctuation errors
have been corrected.  As you read these, notice that there are a
cluster of themes emerging that bear not just on CUPS but on the
wider state of user-interface design under Linux.</p>

</pre>

<p>And, for those of you who thought it was all Red Hat or Fedora'a fault 
and I was being too hard on the CUPS developers, here's what the lead
guy on CUPS had to say:</p>

<pre>
Michael Sweet:
>Overall, I really liked your piece about the problems you've had with
>CUPS.  It underscores several things in CUPS that we were not aware
>of (you're the first to say them), but also a lot of things that Red
>Hat might want to address in future Fedora releases.
</pre>

<p>I am informed that an RFE covering the issues I raised has been
registered on Red Hat Bugzilla.  But quibbles over who is responsible
for which piece of the CUPS-configuration mess are, as the letters
above reinforce, not merely beside the point but evasions of the
actual problem, which is a systemic one that affects thousands of
other projects and our entire community.</p>

<p>Up to now, we haven't been willing to do the real work of making
our software usable.  It doesn't matter whether the the failure of the
browsing defaults in CUPS to match the documentation was a CUPS-team
screwup or a Fedora screwup &mdash; Aunt Tillie doesn't care which
direction that finger points, and I don't either. No, the real problem
is that whoever changed the default didn't immediately fix the
documentation to match it as a matter of spinal reflex.</p>

<p>It also doesn't matter a damn whether the shoddy and unhelpful
design of the printer-configuration tool came out of a CUPS brainpan
or a Fedora brainpan.  What matters is that whoever was
responsible never audited the interface for usability with a real
user.</p>

<p>The CUPS mess is not a failure of one development team, or of one
distribution integrator.  In fact, it makes a better example because
the CUPS guys and the Fedora guys are both well above the median in
both general technical chops, design smarts, and attention to
usability.  The fact that this mess is an example of our <em>best</em>
in action, rather than our worst, just highlights how appallingly low
our standards have been.</p>

<p>It's time for that to change.  And the really heartening thing I
got from the community response is that maybe we're ready for it to
change.  "I thought it was just me" &mdash; many, many of you out there
are already dissatisfied with the poor quality of open-source UIs. but
each of you has tended to think you were alone.  No longer.  It's time 
for each and every one of you out there to become public champions 
for the luxury of ignorance.</p>

<p>Good UI design is not a result of black magic, it just requires paying 
attention.  Being task-oriented rather than feature-oriented.
Recognizing that every time you force a user to learn something, you
have fallen down on your job. And that when Aunt Tillie doesn't
understand your software, the fault &mdash; and the responsibility
to fix it &mdash; lies not with her but with <em>you</em>.</p>

<p>Let's go back to the queue type selection screen.  Remember that
one? It looks like this:

<pre>
        Locally connected
	Networked CUPS (IPP)
	Networked Unix (LPD)
	Networked Windows (SMB)
	Networked Novell (NCP)
	Networked JetDirect
</pre>

<p>This is a feature-oriented menu, not a task-oriented one.  The
attitude it exhales is <q>Oooh!  Look how cool it is that we support
all these printer types!</q>  But you know what?  Aunt Tillie doesn't
care.  She doesn't want to know about all the world's printer types,
she just wants to make her printer work.</p>

<p>A task-oriented configurator would have logic in it like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the machine doesn't have an active LAN interface, gray out all
the "Networked" entries.</li>

<li>If the machine has no device connected to the parallel port and
no USB printers attached, gray out the "Locally connected" entry.</li>

<li>If probing the hosts accessible on the LAN (say, with an
appropriately-crafted Christmas-tree packet) doesn't reveal a Windows
TCP/IP stack, gray out the SMB entry.</li>

<li>If probing the hosts accessible on the LAN doesn't reveal a
Novell Netware NCP stack, gray out the NCP entry.</li>

<li>If probing the hosts accessible on the LAN doesn't reveal a
Jet-Direct firmware TCP/IP stack, gray out the JetDirect entry.</li>

<li>If all Unix hosts on the LAN have CUPS daemons running, gray out
the LPD entry.</li>

<li>If the preceding rules leave just one choice, so inform the user
and go straight to the form for that queue type.</li>

<li>If the preceding rules leave no choices, complain and display the
entire menu.</li> 
</ul>

<p>The technical details of these tests aren't important, and anybody
who writes me arguing for a different set will have fixated on the
wrong level of the problem.  The point is that, unlike a command tool
for techies that should give them lots of choices, the goal of a GUI
is to present the user with <em>as few decision points as
possible</em>.  Remember the Macintosh dictum that the user should
never have to tell the machine anything that it knows or can deduce
for itself.</p>

<p><q>As few as possible decision points</q> is another way of stating
the guiding principle of good UI design for end-users: <em>Allow the
user the luxury of ignorance</em>. This does not mean that you can't
reward acquired knowledge with more choices and more power; you can
and should do that. But the user should also be able to choose to
remain ignorant and still get all their basic tasks done. The more
thoroughly software developers internalize the truth that real users
have better things to do with their time and attention than worship at
the shrine of geek technical prowess, the better off everyone will
be.</p>

<p>One respondent to my earlier essay observed, perceptively, that I
seemed to be trying to raise the reputation value of being good at UI
design.  That's quite right; I think we should make a conscious effort
to raise the standards of quality we demand from each other, so that
blunders like the CUPS configuration mess become deeply embarrassing
to all involved and are less and less often permitted to persist.</p>

<p>It's been twenty years since the GNU Manifesto and nearly seven
since <cite>The Cathedral and the Bazaar</cite>.  I think it's time we
stopped congratulating ourselves quite so much on our dedication to
freedom and our ability to write technically superior code, and began
more often to ask <q>What are we doing to serve the real users?</q>  Good
UI design, and doing the right thing by Aunt Tillie, ought to be a
matter of gut-level pride of craftsmanship.</p>

<p>But if that's too abstract and idealistic for you, think of this.
No matter how skilled you are, there are many times when <em>you</em>
will be the end user.  By learning to demand good UI from others, the
time and sanity you save will ultimately be your own.</p>
</ul>

<p>July 2006 postscript: One Joseph Betz has written a <a href='
http://www.newhorizonssucks.net/LiveCD.html'>hilarious screed</a>
about his adventures with Ubuntu, the current darling of Linux geeks
who have some dim clue there's a usability problem.  He wrote this
before learning of the existence of <cite>The Luxury of
Ignorance</cite>, so it's kind of eerie how parallel they are.</p>

<p>Some resources for learning about good UI design:</p>

<ul>
<li></p>Joel Spolsky has written an excellent demystification of UI
design in <a

Interface Design For Programmers</a>.</p>

<li><p>Bruce Tognazzini is one of the principlal thinkers behind the 
Macintosh User Interface Guidelines.  His <a
