<div class="c2"><em>or, ``I Left My Heart In Shin-Osaka''</em></div>

<p>There was a strange, ambiguous tension about my first landing in
Japan. I went there expecting to be disappointed, and hoping not to
be.</p>

<p>Even for Americans with no cultural ties to the place, the land
of the sword and chrysanthemum has acquired a distinctness in our
imagination few other non-European cultures can match -- a bloody
and romantic image compounded from samurai movies, silk paintings,
images of geishas, prints by Hokusai, and all the other
japanoiserie that has filtered over the International Date Line
since Commodore Perry's time. And, of course, it isn't like that.
Not any more.</p>

<p>But from across the width of the Pacific, a martial artist and
haiku poet and sometime Zen mystic like me can feel very tempted to
love the place all the same. Some of what I have chosen to become,
even in the still places nearest the core of my self, was first
named and given shape in Japan. That means something -- and one of
the reasons I was ready to go there when asked was to find out just
what.</p>

<p>Morning of 25 May, 1999: I had just just finished reading my
second history of Japan as my plane touched down at Narita Airport.
As the cabin crew went through their ritual announcements in
Japanese and English, I tried to estimate the languages' relative
bit density by timing them. The Japanese version seemed to take
about three times longer. Not surprising; English is very dense.
Outside, it was a hot, humid day under cloudless blue skies. One of
my fellow passengers, a middle-aged American woman with the look of
an experienced traveller, assured me ``You've come to a wonderful
place.''</p>

<p>Airports look like airports everywhere; if not for the kanji on
the signs, Narita would hardly have been distinguishable from two
dozen others. My first taste of Japanese uniqueness was the wizened
little old man in the elaborate uniform standing near the head of
the passport-control line, waving arriving passengers towards
available agents with the polite imperiousness of a man who wants
you to leave without any doubt that his job is utterly necessary to
the scheme of things.</p>

<p>I found my first local guide with a minimum of bother. Atsushi
Tajima turned out to be a handsome, studious-looking young man,
clearly a recent university grad, who invited me to call him A.T.
on the grounds that his name is hard to pronounce. I assured him I
could handle `Atsushi' just fine and politely refused his offer to
carry my bags. At our bus stand, a sign announced trips to
Disneyland.</p>

<p>The bus ride to Tokyo was rather extended and we had time to
talk of many things. Atsushi's English was quite good, if a bit
hesitant; he had lived in Los Angeles for two years. He pointed out
Tokyo Disneyland through one window, and later on an artificial ski
slope built in the middle of Tokyo (as if Japan didn't have enough
mountains already!) At one point I found myself trying to explain
the appeal of Zen Buddhism to Western intellectuals, something he
said he didn't understand. ``Nobody cares about it here,'' he
said.</p>

<p>Outside, it looked like New Jersey. Ugly highways, crowded with
cars and small trucks, cut through low hills covered with lush
greenery. The one rice-paddy farm Atsushi pointed out barely
managed not to look like an anachronism. I asked Tajima-san what
the Japanese for ``Excuse me'' is in case I jostled someone,
remarking that I understood the importance of being polite, and he
astonished me. ``Not so necessary these days to be polite,'' he
said ``just to appear polite.'' I wondered what the difference
could possibly be, but sensed that any answer would probably be
more confusing than enlightening and held my peace.</p>

<p>Tokyo itself I mentally tagged the City of Weird Buildings. They
were all western-style, but with a good many bizarre wedge shapes
and skinny towerlets sitting on contorted plots of land. Atsushi
confirmed that this is what happens when you combine astronomical
real-estate values with incomprehensible zoning rules. A thick
blanket of smog hung over the city, low in a pitiless sky.</p>

<p>As we pulled up to the Palace Hotel I noticed the first
traditional building I had seen yet, white plaster and curved
roof-tiles peeping through trees over a stretch of water. ``The
Emperor's garden'' Atsushi said; and indeed the lobby doors of the
Palace Hotel turned out to sit about a hundred yards from the main
gatehouse of the Imperial Palace grounds. We walked over after I
got settled in, only to find it closed. As we looked down he walk
at the closed gates, Atsushi astonished me again by telling me he'd
never tried to visit the place. ``It's your <em>history</em>,
man!'' I said, and he told me he had only studied enough Japanese
history to pass his college entrance exams. ``I feel a little
ashamed'' he said, looking more meditative than I had yet seen.</p>

<p>One of my Japanese contacts had recruited a resident American,
with interests paralleling mine in martial arts and computers, to
show me around a bit; I had exchanged email with her from the U.S.
A short while after Atsushi left me settled in, Patricia Yarrow
materialized at my door. She turned out to be a tall, lean,
contralto-voiced woman who looked at first glance as though the
word `awkward' ought to describe her, but actually moved with the
sureness and unobtrusive grace I'd expect of a long-time aikido
student. We went to the hotel restaurant for dinner. She ordered in
fluent Japanese.</p>

<p>Patricia, too, assured me I had come to a wonderful place. But
then: ``The veneer of Western civilization is about four
millimeters deep here. Underneath they're still rice farmers.'' She
added that she meant that in a good way -- she claimed Japanese
will often deny or not talk about their attachment to traditional
things, as if (I gathered) their core cultural identity is a
private thing not for the eyes of gaijin (outsiders).</p>

<p>This sounded plausible, but I also felt Tajima-san had been
sincere to this gaijin in that meditative moment at the Emperor's
gate. One distinction basic to the social psychology of Japanese
has always been honne (truth; literally ``taproot'' or ``trunk'')
versus tatemae (face; literally ``standing in front of''), with
honne a deeply private matter and tatemae the acceptable self
presented to the world. Perhaps (I thought) the traditions of Japan
are still honne and Westernization tatemae -- but a `face' so
accustomed that younger Japanese acknowledge their roots hardly
more often to themselves than they do to outsiders.</p>

<p>Or perhaps it was just Tajima-san. ``Beware of
generalizations,'' Patricia said gravely, unaware of my musings.
``They don't work here.'' Meanwhile, kimono-clad waitresses
fluttered around us, looking (Patricia agreed, laughing) just as
cute as in the movies.</p>

<p>Tajima-san and I went back to the Imperial precincts the
following morning. Trees had been planted all around the perimeter
of the Palace grounds to shut out modern Tokyo (Atsushi confirmed
this was deliberate). Within, all was green and quiet. Great walls
of unmortared, hand-fitted stone brooded over gardens and wooden
buildings of archaic style. Well-labeled maps and unobtrusive signs
(in English as well as Japanese) were everywhere, but the buildings
themselves revealed nothing beyond their delicate exterior
grace.</p>

<p>At Atsushi's suggestion we followed one such sign, marked
``Imperial Residence'' up a rather steeply-sloped walk. The
residence, set off from the walk by a screen of trees, was barely
visible. From within it came a strange, plangent, echoing sound
like a flock of bronze-throated birds mourning an old death. We
stopped to listen. Atsushi seemed fascinated. I had seen something
in one of the histories about a very ancient musical form
associated with Imperial court ritual...</p>

<p>``Is that `gagaku'?'' I asked him.</p>

<p>``Yes!'' he said excitedly. ``I had forgotten that word!''.</p>

<p>Somewhere nearby, within the sound of those archaic bugles,
walked the priest-king of the Japanese tribe. He might well be in
the very midst of a Shinto rite handed down unchanged through two
thousand years. People in Japan, as I was later unsurprised to
learn, conceive of the Residence as the center of their country. If
there is a heart of Japan, we had found it -- discreetly veiled,
but announcing itself with sounds of ineffable sadness.</p>

<p>Those sounds followed us through the gardens as we walked
quietly away. Our next stop was a donjon mound built after Perry's
opening of Japan, during the Meiji Restoration. Huge, imposing
blocks of stone fitted together like three-dimensional crazy paving
reared three stories high. This had been the highest point in Tokyo
at one time, but the wooden castle surmounting it burned down less
than twenty years after it was built. Now a handful of tourists
walked where daimyos and shoguns and emperors had pondered the tide
of wrenching change sweeping the country of their tribe. Faint
sounds of gagaku bugles from the deeper past still drifted to us in
the still summer air.</p>

<p>But we had a taxi to catch. The time for my first talk was
drawing near. It was out of the gardens, back into Tokyo's roaring
bustle, and over to the Nikkei building for us. And, waiting for
Atsushi, I'd had no breakfast; my stomach was growling. Atsushi
tried to get us into the Nikkei Grill, only to be told by an
apologetic maitre d' in a tuxedo that it was full; so we ascended a
few floors to the company cafeteria.</p>

<p>Within was cheerful noise. Women in headscarves and
halfway-peasant garb slung bowls of soup and rice and noodles at
customers amidst gales of shrill Japanese banter. The ticking of
plastic chopsticks and the clink of plates competed with antiseptic
Japanese muzak dribbling from hidden speakers overhead. Brightly
lit vending machines labeled in kanji and bad English lined the
walls, selling unguessable things. If the fancy grill and the
maitre d's tux downstairs had been tatemae, the cafeteria was
honne; I didn't feel I'd lost by the exchange. Lunch was rice and
miso and sliced chicken.</p>

<p>The talk itself was harder work than usual. I knew my normal
slangy and informal speaking style would be a non-starter here;
stand-up comedian moves seldom cross language barriers very well.
On top of that, I knew I needed to be talking about half-speed so
the simultaneous translators could keep up. The few jokes I
attempted anyway fell flat with nearly audible thuds -- I got the
distinct impression that the audience would have thought it
disrespectful to laugh.</p>

<p>The lack of response was more than just a blow to my pride; my
jokes are an important part of my communication technique, devices
to keep the audience's attention and probe its interests. Without
the feedback they normally elicit I don't know how to tune my
presentation. But afterwards the audience members asked questions
sharp enough to make it clear they had been paying careful and
intelligent attention.</p>

<p>I got through the two hours OK, and the interview for a Japanese
Linux magazine that followed. One of the interviewers was Hiroo
Yamagata, the man who had translated ``The Cathedral and the
Bazaar'' into Japanese -- and, by all indications, done a superb
job with my difficult idiomatic English. After that it was an hour
or so downtime at my hotel, and over to Tengu for dinner with the
Tokyo Linux User's Group.</p>

<p>Tengu is a popular Japanese chain restaurant something like a
brew pub and something like a dim sum place -- passable beer, tasty
light food in small portions, and a noisy party atmosphere. TLUG
has regular nights there; I was told they had arranged this one so
I could hang out with them without having to be the center of an
official event. It was a good idea.</p>

<p>The company was enjoyable. Patricia joined us, and her friend
Stephen Carter from the American Chamber of Commerce in Tokyo. The
crowd was about half-Japanese, half-gaijin. Most everybody spoke
English. We ate gyoza (Japanese dumplings) and salad and little
cubes of sauteed steak, and chicken on skewers. One dish,
Korean-style roast pork with peppered cabbage, I found particularly
welcome. While I found I liked Tokyo cooking well enough, the
flavor range of Japanese cooking in general tends to be narrow and
a bit on the bland side. After three days of nothing but that and
airline food I was more than ready for a bit of robust flavor and
spice.</p>

<p>As the festivities wound down, Patricia and I attempted to bail
out so we could go for a walk in the Ginza, Tokyo's neon-lit
shopping district. Patricia had suggested a bit of sightseeing and
a trip to one of the famous Japanese baths. However, when I got up
to leave, it brought out the autograph-seekers. I spent the next
twenty minutes scrawling my signature on copies of ``The Cathedral
and the Bazaar'', shaking hands, posing for pictures, and receiving
business cards with my best imitation of proper Japanese ritual
(take with both hands, peer at it, say the giver's name, mumble
something respectful about the title and organization).</p>

<p>By the time we stepped out of the subway at a Ginza stop, it had
gotten late and was starting to rain lightly. We poked around a bit
among the bright flashing signs and scurrying crowds. Patricia
showed me both the vast Tokyo convention center (so futuristic it
looked like a set from a science-fiction movie) and her favorite
stand-up noodle shop (timeless peasant food served by men in
kimono-like white garb). It was time to call it a night, and we
navigated back towards the Palace Hotel. Patricia, explaining that
Tokyo is notoriously disorienting even to its natives, made sure I
got within sight of the building before letting me go on alone.</p>

<p>She headed back to the Tengu to collect her bicycle, and I
followed the moat around the Imperial Gardens the rest of the way
there. The green water lapping at old stone a foot from my feet
seemed to reduce the night traffic noise to irrelevance. The trees
on the other side stood patient guard around the Gardens. It was
very peaceful. Well, peaceful for Tokyo, anyway.</p>

<p>Next day's talk at the ACM Japan Summer Conference went much
better, at least as far as audience response went. Tsutomu
Kamimura, one of the conference organizers, collected me in
mid-morning. He was a contrast from my previous native guide; a
navy-suited salaryman in early middle age, looking every inch the
strategic planner for IBM Japan that his business card announced,
He took me to lunch in downtown Tokyo at a
cook-your-own-ingredients Korean barbeque place. Apparently this is
a popular restaurant format in Japan. It's all you can eat for a
fixed price, with grills set right into the tables. Very enjoyable
-- and a good respite for meat-hungry gaijin seeking a restful
halfway point between Japan's rather challenging cuisine and
Western food.</p>

<p>With some time still to kill, we made a brief stop at a
bookstore where I discovered I had not brought along enough money
to buy any of the tempting translations of Japanese literature in
the English-language section. An effect of this, however, was that
Kamimura-san and I talked about haiku. Now, I do not normally
inflict my poetry on strangers, but there was a particular one I
had written that I decided I wanted to see his reaction to. For two
reasons: One: after watching my jokes fall flat the previous day I
wanted to find out if I could get a Japanese to display a sense of
humor at all. Two: it would tell me something about an educated
Japanese's relationship to the traditional arts to see how he
responded to a satire of them. So I spoke these runes:</p>

<blockquote>Climbing Mount Fuji,<br />
Cherry blossoms in the wind,<br />
I see a Coke stand.<br />
</blockquote>

<p>Kamimura-san laughed out loud. Perhaps (I thought) there is
hope.</p>

<p>The ACM conference audience laughed at my jokes too. Some of
them did, anyway; things were definitely looking up in the
cross-cultural communications department. The other afternoon
speaker was a neoclassical economist named Stephen Turnbull who, as
a tenured foreign academic in Japan, turned out to have a most
interesting angle of view on Japanese culture. We hit it off well
and ended up doing a joint question-and-answer session after his
talk, fielding questions about business trends related to open
source. Afterwards, Stephen and I and two computer-science
colleagues of his went back to the Palace and had a sumptuous
Japanese dinner.</p>

<p>The conversation ranged far and wide, but often circled back to
the social psychology of the Japanese. Perhaps the most interesting
tidbit of the evening was Stephen's take on my conversation with
Tajima-san. He claimed that, despite their reputation for being
reserved with foreigners, Japanese are more likely to show honne to
a gaijin, because the risk of social repercussions is lower.</p>

<p>The following morning I rode the famous bullet train
(`shinkansen' in Japanese) to Kyoto. It runs west along the route
of the old Tokaido Road, long the main communications artery of
pre-industrial Japan and subject of many a historical print. Images
of monks on pilgrimage, peasants hauling produce, and the armored
retainers of daimyos danced in my head. I could see through the
window that all of these had been replaced by a lively but crowded
urban sprawl. The only open space I saw was the occasional paddy
farm.</p>

<p>I'd been a little concerned about my rendezvous in Kyoto; I had
never gotten the name or local phone number of the people I was
supposed to meet there, and had visions of missing them and having
to navigate my way to Kyoto Sangyo University without more than my
three or four words of Japanese to help. But the all-reserved-seats
system meant that the KSU people knew which door of the train I
would walk out of, and they were waiting right there. Wearing
printed ``ESR In Kyoto'' name badges, no less. Leading the parade
was Greg Peterson, an American professor of English long resident
in Japan.</p>

<p>There was a little slack in the schedule, so we had time to
visit one of Kyoto's landmarks located right near the train
station; a Buddhist temple noted for the fact that Oda Nobunaga
(the first of the three pivotal figures in the Unification Wars)
was killed there by a disgruntled vassal.</p>

<p>It was the first time I had ever visited a Buddhist temple, and
I needed instruction in the etiquette; ring the bell, drop a coin
in the offering box, make a short gassho (a bow with hands folded),
then remove your shoes and enter quietly.</p>

<p>The interior was rich with gilded carvings and the smell of
fragrant woods. I didn't know what sect the temple was attached to,
but the elaborateness of the furnishings suggested something other
than Zen (I suspected one of the Pure Land sects and found out
later it was Jodo Shinsu). There was no one inside. One of my
companions mentioned that although Buddhist temples are routinely
left open and unattended, they are never, ever robbed or
vandalized. This report makes an interesting contrast with the
cheerful indifference to religion Atsushi Tajima and all the
Japanese I discussed it with said was typical there.</p>

</table>

<p>Then it was off to Kyoto Sangyo University for interviews and my
talk. KSU was an interesting example of the faintly terrifying
efficiency the Japanese often display when imitating Western
models. Like their train system, it struck me as being just a
little bigger, cleaner, and faster than its American prototypes. We
had been invited to witness the opening of a new computer lab -- no
fewer than two hundred PCs on a fast local network, all equipped
with the latest flatscreen displays. The network was slaved to the
teacher's machine, sitting under his desk on a raised dais on one
side of the machine; all two hundred PCs could be rebooted into
either Linux or Windows at the touch of a button. Furthermore,
between each pair of student machines sat another flatscreen
repeating the contents of the teacher's display. Not for Japanese
the comparative anarchy of an American workstation cluster with
each student pacing his or her own work.</p>

<p>After the demonstration, two interviews with people from
Japanese magazines and newsletters. The surprise of the afternoon
was one of my interviewers, a devastatingly cute woman named Maya
with a thousand-candlepower smile, and English just accented enough
to still sound exotic. Anybody who wrote her off as a piece of
fluff would be making a serious mistake, however -- this was a
reporter with sharp instincts, and not above using her charm to try
to dazzle a man into an unguarded reply (such as, in this case, the
names of the actual sources of the <a
href="http://www.opensource.org/halloween.html">Halloween
Documents</a>).</p>

<p>Partway through the interview, though, something clicked and
biology took over in a mutual rush of oxytocin. I continued to
field Maya's questions in my best professional manner, but there
was some serious, involuntary and completely nonverbal
communication that had nothing to do with reporter/subject going
both ways across the table. All the mate-with-strangers instincts
our Pleistocene ancestors had evolved to head off inbreeding in
their little nomadic bands clamored for action; it was exogamy
meltdown time.</p>

<p>This did not go unnoticed by the onlookers. I wouldn't have been
entirely surprised if they'd thrown a couple buckets of icewater on
the two of us to keep us from igniting the furniture, but what I
got was gentle ribbing afterwards. ``Love at first sight'' Greg
Peterson joked benignly, an exaggeration but pardonable under the
circumstances. This was, after all, coming from a gaijin who'd
married a Japanese woman; good odds he'd had a similar
oxytocin-rush moment years ago and gone with it. He promised me I
would meet Maya again at the dinner after the talk.</p>

<p>The other interview also went extremely well; it was with a
well-known Japanese hacker and technical-magazine writer named
Kenji Rikitake who seemed to have picked up some bracingly American
chutzpah along with his English and technical skills; his questions
were searching. I mention him here because some of our
off-the-record discussion revealed that at least some younger,
well-educated Japanese are developing attitudes that an American
would call outright libertarian. However, Kenji-san also displayed
consciousness of being in a very small vanguard minority.</p>

<p>The talk itself turned out to be very hard work. The problem was
the consecutive-translation setup; the interpreters were on the
same P.A. system as my microphone -- so I had to speak my talk
sentence by slow sentence, each time waiting for the translation to
complete before I could continue. As if by compensation, the
audience was far more relaxed and willing to pose questions and
laugh at my jokes than the Tokyo people had been. I found out later
that Japanese from the Kansai (Kyoto/Kobe/Osaka) area have a
reputation (which they relish themselves) for being relaxed and
quick to see the humorous side of things. Overall it went very
well, but I was sweating with effort by the time it wound up.</p>

<p>Then it was off to dinner at a Japanese Chinese restaurant --
that is, Chinese cooking styles interpreted for Japanese. Perhaps
unsurprisingly, it's rather more like Japanese cooking than
anything Americans would think of as Chinese; light food, very
little use of sauces, little meat. But it was a feast just the
same; we had close to twenty people at three low tables in a
private room. And indeed Maya came with us; I saved her a spot next
to me only to discover that (oh tragedy!) she had to catch the
bullet train home to Shin-Osaka and could not stay for the party.
There was general commiseration at this, not unmixed with more
ribbing.</p>

<p>The party managed to recover from this reverse, however. Maya's
place at my right was claimed by Tomoko Yoshida, the colleague of
Greg Peterson's who had with him co-organized my schedule in Kyoto.
``She's married!'' Greg warned me laughingly, to which I retorted
``But she's just as pretty as Maya, and more experienced, and I'm
not dead!'' And indeed Tomoko made an interesting study; she
combined the lotus-blossom beauty and mannered, almost childlike
femininity of a traditional Japanese woman with formidable
intelligence and a quiet but unmistakable will to achieve. A very
well-known promoter of open-source software in Japan, she had
written a successful introductory book called ``Hop Skip Linux''
aimed at Japanese women.</p>

</table>

<p>The KLUG people dynamited every stereotype about Japanese
reserve that evening. The gathering was full of laughter and
warmth. They gave me flowers and touching little presents and even
a pair of earrings for my wife Cathy (Maya picked those out!). The
high point of the evening was probably when they gave me a Japanese
calligraphy set and Tomoko walked me through the process of copying
a sampler they had prepared that read ``The Cathedral and the
Bazaar''. Needless to say, her copy was a great deal better than
mine. We traded; I have it still.</p>

<p>I learned a couple of Japanese party rituals we could probably
stand to import to the U.S. One is the kanpai toast. You formally
open a party with a group toast by everybody there; clink glasses
and yell ``Kanpai!'' (``dry cup!''). There's an even more useful
ritual for closing a party called `single-clap ceremony'; the host
tells everybody to get ready, then calls out on a rising note and
everybody claps sharply once. I think having such framing rituals
helps everybody do the appropriate mental state-change to have a
good time.</p>

<p>Next morning, I thought a lot about Maya and how delighted she'd
seemed by a little flattering attention. Greg Peterson had told me
later that night something a couple of other gaijin and Japanese
later confirmed; Japanese men, in general, don't know how to give
women gallant compliments -- and don't understand why it's an
issue. ``A little appreciation,'' he said, ``can go a long way with
Japanese women'', and this was clearly the voice of experience
speaking.</p>

<p>It made me sad to think of bright, beautiful Maya going through
life without the praise that should be her due; whether or not I
ever saw her again (and it didn't seem likely I would) I felt she
deserved to know there was at least one man in the world who had
found her entirely lovely and was willing to say so straight out.
On the other hand, I'm a happily married man; and, while my wife
doesn't mind my showing another woman a good time occasionally,
there is effectively zero probability that I'm ever going to be
Maya's Mr. Right.</p>

<p>When in Rome, be a Roman candle. When in Kyoto, make like a
Heian-period courtier. So I did what Prince Genji or any other
hopeless romantic of 11th-century Japan would have in this
situation; I wrote Maya a poem expressing these sentiments. It was
in English, to be sure, but in a Japanese form (seven connected
haiku). After I hooked up with my local guides later in the
morning, I recruited co-conspirators to help me email it to her.
The fact that in Japan we could assemble the necessary technology
casually while on the train to a twelve-hundred-year-old sacred
city, and then ship it from the train station, is part of the point
of telling this story.</p>

<p>Perhaps a more interesting point is that, according to a number
of gaijin both male and female with which I discussed the matter,
Maya's and my involuntary-exogamic-meltdown experience was not an
especially unusual one (except maybe for the fact that we
<em>didn't</em> immediately drag each other into the bushes, and
the haiku-writing part afterwards). Two men and one woman with whom
I was able to discuss the matter discreetly knew exactly what I was
talking about, and I'm almost certain a third man I'd met
beforehand would have as well. Depending on one's existing
relationships, this represents either a major opportunity or major
hazard of travel in Japan.</p>

<p>And it gives one to think. Before industrialization and mass
travel, you could probably trigger the exogamic instinct by hiking
fifteen miles over to the next village. Now, in the age of global
television and jet planes, we're all more used to each other -- it
takes crossing the Pacific Ocean. Will cultural homogenization
eventually kill off the romance of the exotic? Or are there more
primitive pheromonal cues for `stranger' involved in the response
(the scent of her skin, the smell of my sweat) that don't make it
through media? I wish I knew -- and damn, it would be fun to do the
research...</p>

<p>My local guides the following morning were Tomoko and three
other KLUG people. The train took us to Nara -- the oldest
(pre-Heian) imperial capital of Japan. Nara is small enough that
you can do most of it on foot. It was a sunny, warm day; we
strolled among ornamental ponds and twelve-hundred-year-old
Buddhist temples and even older Shinto shrines, eating soft
ice-cream and avoiding deer poop.</p>

<p>Nara is infested with a kind of dwarf red deer, spotted and
antlered and perhaps four feet high at the shoulder, that has been
protected by the temples for so many generations that they are
utterly fearless around humans. All the trees in Nara have wire
cages around them to keep the deer from stripping off the bark;
instead, the deer subsist partly on grass but mostly on flat
biscuits that visitors feed them as an act of religious merit. The
economy of Nara is probably driven by the sale of those
biscuits.</p>

<p>Nara is also infested with schoolchildren. Anywhere you find
Japanese historical sites, you'll find Japanese schoolchildren in
happy navy-uniformed mobs (often led by flag-bearers). Nara was
full of them on that fine day. It was common to see schoolgirls
shrieking in half-terror, half-delight as the deer nuzzled at them
looking for biscuits. The deer, in turn, suffered themselves to be
petted and handled with fair good grace.</p>

<p>Our first serious stop was a national historical museum devoted
to Buddhist antiquities from the Nara period. There were silk
paintings and serene statues a-plenty, but I thought the most
exquisite works of art there were a trio of sutras calligraphed on
black or purple paper in gold ink. Those sacred kanji glowed like
fire against darkness. They were of truly exquisite beauty.</p>

<p>Our next stop was Todai-ji and the Great Buddha of Nara. The
huge bronze image of Buddha, hand raised in benediction, was as
impressive as I had expected. Its setting was hardly less so -- a
vast, dim cathedral-like hall, the largest purely wooden building
in existence anywhere, lit with hundreds of flickering candles each
left with a wish by pilgrims and worshipers. Lessor statues of
attendants and protective deities, often gilded, surrounded the
main image; but if you go there, it is the serene face of the
Buddha that will remain in your mind.</p>

<p>The monks at Todai-ji have invented a charming way to raise
money for their new roof. For a thousand yen, you can paint a wish
on a big curved tile which will become part of the roof. I wrote
the following with a brush, fortunately doing rather better at
painting romaji (Roman letters) than I had at kanji: ``My wish for
peace and harmony among all who work for freedom -- whether in
software or elsewhere.''</p>

<p>The streets of Nara were in some ways as interesting as its
temples; half tourist attraction, half sacred space. At one point
my companions insisted that I take a rickshaw ride. In vain did I
protest that rickshaws are hardly an ornament to Japanese history,
having been invented by Hong Kong Chinese to serve lazy British
colonialists in the mid-19th century. Tomoko talked me into it and
rode with me.</p>

<p>The rickshaw boy was literally a boy, a sturdy lad of perhaps
nineteen who (through Tomoko) kept up a running conversation as he
hauled us around. He seemed genuinely curious about me, in a
friendly way. I suppose an interest in people is a useful trait in
his job. Tomoko, the mischievous wench, told him all about my
mini-romance with Maya; I could tell by the English words scattered
through her rapid-fire Japanese. Her look of mock-contrition when I
told her I'd caught her out was very comical.</p>

<p>The view from the rickshaw was only a few feet further off the
ground than you'd get walking, but psychologically very different;
the vehicle seemed designed to make a rider feel like master of all
he surveys. ``I feel like such an imperialist'' I said to Tomoko.
``We are imperial family, he is peasant,'' she said, gesturing at
the boy and laughing. I thought about trying to explain the
difference and concluded it wasn't very important. We bowed
politely to the peasant after we had paid him for the ride.</p>

<p>By the time the five of us had walked back to the Nara train
station from the Todai-ji, Tomoko and I were chaffing each other
like old American friends. Two of the others looked slightly
bemused by this, but also as if they were wishing they had fluent
enough English to join in. The third, a young man named Oliver
Bolzer, was himself an interesting window on the deep changes
happening in Japan -- the dark-haired, pale-skinned son of a German
father and a Japanese mother, he speaks both idiomatic Japanese and
flawless English and moves easily between the ethnic and cultural
worlds of both his parents.</p>

<p>We rode the train back to Kyoto and hauled over to a ryokan, a
traditional Japanese inn. The place was all tatami mats and paper
walls and smiling women in kimonos, but the attempt to evoke old
Japan was a bit compromised by the electric-eye automatic doors and
the color televisions in the rooms. The Japanese with me did not
seem bothered by the incongruity.</p>

<p>Another traditional dinner (and more unhurried conversation)
followed. The my companions and I took lots of pictures. Tomoko and
I hugged, quite un-selfconsciously, for the cameras. I remember
thinking I would like to meet her husband sometime; any man who
could attract a dynamo like her would likely be a good one to
know.</p>

<p>My hosts had been concerned that, like many gaijin, I would not
handle sleeping on the floor well. But the truth is that I had been
finding the hotel mattresses rather soft for my taste. I slept
better on the ryokan's tatami floor and futon than I had since
arriving in Japan.</p>

<p>The following morning I enjoyed a traditional Japanese breakfast
of rice soup and miso, served to me by a young woman wearing
traditional garb. The grace and beauty of the presentation largely
compensated for the fact that a lot of the other food on the tray
was, well, <em>slimy</em>. The Japanese have an unfortunate
fondness for a combination of bland flavor and rubbery/wet/gooey
textures that, at its worst, causes me actual if mild nausea. One
of the problems with leaving Tokyo and going to less Westernized
areas is that this tendency gets worse -- travellers, be warned.
Fortunately, the pretty young woman in kimono withdrew quietly
after laying out the food, so I could struggle with it in
private.</p>

<p>The next group to take the baton in the show-Eric-san-around
relay materialized at around ten to take me to Nijo Castle. This
was where the restoration of the Meiji Emperor was formally
proclaimed in 1867, inaugurating Japan's modern era; in fact, we
saw the hall where Shogun Yoshinobu did the deed. The castle
featured a lot of the same sort of impressive look-Ma-no-mortar
stone walls I had seen at the Imperial Gardens, and two rather
lovely gardens of its own.</p>

<p>Nijo-jo was built as a demonstration of power by the Tokugawa
Shogunate in the first flush of its success, the so-called Momoyama
period; the building exteriors were meant to be impressive, and
they succeeded. But the most interesting feature was the
`nightingale floors' -- floor panels in the outer castle actually
designed to chirp like singing birds when trodden upon, to reveal
intruders. The inevitable mobs of schoolchildren just loved this
effect.</p>

<p>At lunch I suggested we find a Western-food place. Having
observed how Chinese food had been localized in Japan and Japanese
food westernized in the U.S., I wanted to observe what the Japanese
had done to American food. So we went to a place called ``Jolly
Pizza'' and I got an education. Kyoto's pizza (a Japanese imitation
of an American imitation of Italian food) turns out to feature
toppings like squid, eggplant, and pear. Very weird.</p>

<p>I had expressed a particular interest in Rinzai Zen sites, and
after lunch we went to Ryoan-ji, a temple of that school with a
famous rock garden. I won't give physical details, because to try
would be to say either too little or or too much. But the temple
was everything an admirer of that tradition could wish -- a truly
lovely place where wild beauty harmonized with spare and simple
architecture to express an astonishing, refreshing serenity. The
healing silence calmed even the ever-present schoolchildren. As we
left, I could see expressions of deep happiness on the faces of my
companions, and knew they were reflected in my own.</p>

<p>``This is what I came to Japan for.'' I told them. ``Each of the
four or five cultures I have lived in has a few things it can hold
up to the world and say `This is the best there is.'
<em>That</em>,'' I said, pointing back at Ryoan-ji and by clearly
understood extension the whole Zen tradition that created it, ``is
one of yours.'' Their pleasure was palpable. One of them thanked me
formally, which can be quite an affecting production from a
Japanese who really means it.</p>

<p>I was up for more temples -- I wanted to see one of a different
sect, and then another Rinzei site (for baseline). A little Kyoto
guidebook I had been given two nights previously had mentioned the
existence of one with a very strong Chinese architectural
influence; I thought that would be interesting. Unfortunately, I
couldn't remember the name of the place -- nor find the guidebook,
which had apparently evaporated sometime during my stay at the
ryokan.</p>

<p>With approximately 3000 temples and shrines in and around Kyoto,
no pointer meant no chance of finding the place. After a little
discussion, Kiyota Hashimoto (the most fluent English speaker among
my four companions) suggested we go to a temple called Daitoku-ji
(``Great Wisdom Temple'') which has a famous Chinese-style
gate.</p>

<p>Daitoku-ji is actually a complex of twenty-two temples. Most are
living holy places of Buddhism and not open to visitors. We were
fortunate to be there on a day when a small temple called
Kohrin-ji, not normally accessible to the public, had been opened
for a memorial ceremony. Visitors were allowed in but requested not
to intrude on the ceremony itself. Solemn-faced monks in blue robes
collected a small admission fee.</p>

<p>The part of Kohrin-Ji we had access to consisted of a vestibule,
a waiting area with benches, and a main room visible from the
waiting area. Adjacent to a long side of the main room, under the
outer eaves of the temple roof, ran a gallery or walkway from which
one could view a rock garden. An usher motioned us to the benches
in the waiting area. We could see quite a few Japanese, some in the
robes of monks but most in formal Western clothing, sitting quietly
in the main hall.</p>

<p>Shortly I noticed that a few visitors apparently unconnected
with the memorial service (mostly gaijin) had filtered into the
gallery without being reproached by the usher and were quietly
enjoying the view of the rock garden. I murmured to my companions
that I was going to do likewise and slipped out to join them.</p>

<p>Nothing seemed more natural than to sit zazen for a while in the
warm sunshine. I rested my eyes on the craggy rocks of the sand
garden and let time slip away, allowing sensation to pass through
my mind without attaching thoughts or judgments to it. Soon I had
forgotten the ceremony behind me, but was reminded by the huge
mellow crash of a temple gong from over my right shoulder.
Fortunately, I had been doing my meditation correctly, so I didn't
jump three feet in the air! Instead the sound reverberated through
my body like the compression wave from an explosion and threw me
into deeper meditation. Behind me, someone began to chant long,
sonorous phrases in some liturgical language; not Sanskrit or
Chinese, so probably archaic Japanese. The chant washed through me
like the sunshine streaming from above. Then the gong sounded
again. And again. As each stroke passed through me I felt a pulse
of joy, and as though I was becoming transparent -- my body melting
into air. And the rest was silence.</p>

<p>When I was ready to move again, we left quietly and wandered
through the temple precincts. Most of the entrances were marked
``No Admittance'', but one sign reading ``Zen garden'' pointed us
to a path where another open sub-temple seemed likely. Indeed it
was so; and this is how we came to Daisen-in.</p>

<p>Now we come to the part of the story where I have to intone, in
my best Dave Barry voice, ``I am not making this up.'' Throughout
this account I have tried to be as factual as fallible memory would
let me be, but what happened next was sufficiently odd that I made
a special point of checking details with four witnesses and writing
bits down immediately afterwards.</p>

<p>As we entered Daisen-in we passed through a high-ceilinged
vestibule. Beyond it sat a ticket-taker in a booth, and beside the
booth squatted an old man in wire-rimmed glasses with the shaven
head and blue robes of a monk. As we were buying our tickets the
old man peered at me, emitted a flurry of Japanese at my
companions, and demanded in broken but recognizable English ``You
from New York?''. ``Philadelphia,'' I said, but he appeared to miss
this and said ``Ah, New York''. To my astonishment he began singing
a rather cracked rendition of Frank Sinatra's famous song about the
Big Apple. By the time he had lurched through ``If I can make it
here, I can make it anywhere!'' my companions and I were in full
boggle mode.</p>

<p>``I'm from Philadelphia.'' I repeated more loudly. This
stimulated another burst of Japanese among which the words ``very
handsome man'' were audible. Unsure how to deal with this, my
companions and I retreated towards the gallery (the plan of this
place was similar to that of Kohrin-ji).</p>

<p>The main rock garden out front was austere to the point of
ugliness; its only features were two large conical mounds of
gravel. However, the gallery continued around the side and rear of
the temple. Tucked between the gallery and temple walls were the
most beautiful Zen gardens I have ever seen, in Japan or anywhere
else -- wild miniature symphonies in sand, moss, and rock. They
were even finer than Ryoan-ji's (though Ryoan-ji as a whole still
beat Daisen-in's handily in the aesthetic sweepstakes).</p>

<p>The gallery wrapped around to the front vestibule. Beyond the
old man, still yattering way in Japanese, was a small gift shop;
nothing tacky (thank the Lords of Karma) just a few pieces of
tasteful calligraphy and Zen art. Amidst the kanji, small posters
lettered in French and English caught my eye. The English one said
this:</p>

<pre>
Each day in life is training
Training for myself
Though failure is possible
Living for each moment
Equal to anything
Ready for anything

                 I am alive
                 I am this moment
                 My future is here and now

For if I cannot endure today
When and where will I?
                          Soen Ozeki
                        Daisen-in Temple, Kyoto
</pre>

<p>I was thrilled. This Soen Ozeki had captured in a few spare
verses why I care about Zen. Not the Buddhism; I'm not really a
Buddhist. I don't discipline myself in order to achieve detachment,
rather the reverse -- I detach myself in order to achieve
discipline. What I prize most in Zen is its existential clarity,
the razor-precise awareness of the moment that leapt from this Soen
Ozeki's words.</p>

<p>I tried to convey this to my companions. The other three
apparently lacked the English to follow, but Kiyota (with whom I
had discussed Zen earlier in the day) grinned and nodded
vigorously. He and I exchanged a look of understanding. Wishing I
could meet the poet, I wondered out loud if Soen Ozeki was a
historical personage or still alive. Somebody behind me said ``He
is the &lt;something&gt; of this temple''; I thought the title had
been `abbot'; but was not sure I had parsed the Japanese accent
correctly.</p>

<p>We walked the few steps to the vestibule. The old man was still
there. I asked Kiyota to tell him that I thought his abbot's words
were very wise. This stimulated another freshet of Japanese, among
which I heard unmistakably the English phrase ``<em>my</em>
teaching.''</p>

<p>Startled, I gathered my thoughts together and formed the
intention to make for the first time in my life a formal gassho
(the deep bow, hands together, of Zen student to teacher) to this
monk, who could be none other than Ozeki himself. But before I
could execute the bow, he leapt up and seized a small American flag
from a rather cheesy-looking flags-of-the-world display I had not
noticed before. Assuming a rigid military bearing, he clutched the
flag to his breast and -- I swear I am not making this up -- a loud
recording of ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' began to play from hidden
speakers (the most pompous possible John Philip Souza-oid
arrangement, natch). But that wasn't all. As we looked on in
dumbfounded amazement, a spinning globe of the world (looking like
it had been bought secondhand from some high-school classroom)
descended on wires from the shadowed upper reaches of the
vestibule.</p>

<p>I think it was shortly after the recording quit, as the globe
was rising whence it had come, that I dimly began to suspect I had
done a karmic face-plant right into the middle of a Zen story. And
even as the five of us retreated in confusion down the flagstone
path away from Daisen-in, giggling helplessly, some of us started
to grok that we had been well and truly mindfucked by a master of
the art.</p>

<p>A few minutes later I went back to Daisen-in to copy Master
Ozeki's poem. As I was finishing copying it onto an envelope I had
had in my pocket, I heard the old man behind me speaking rapid
Japanese with someone. I heard the phrase ``handsome man from
Philadelphia'' again. In the kinesic language of Japanese, one may
thank another for receiving a useful or valuable piece of writing
by bowing with the item held in both hands nearly at one's
forehead; I had even seen gaijin use this gesture. I turned,
performed it with feeling at Master Ozeki, and left.</p>

<p>The interpretation of Soen Ozeki's dharma lesson I leave, in the
best Zen figure-it-out-for-yourself-Grasshopper tradition, as an
exercise for the reader -- but as evidence that the exercise is
worth trying I submit that Kiyota Hashimoto and I apparently
arrived independently at similar if not identical readings shortly
after the event. The main points of the lesson were not especially
subtle. Here's a clue: Master Ozeki changed the script on me
<em>just as I was about to bow</em>.</p>

<p>There seemed to all of us little point in visiting more temples
after Daisen-in -- no way could we top it. Kiyota remarked to
general agreement that I had been very fortunate: ``both ends of
the Zen experience in one afternoon''. So we drove off in the
direction of the little provincial town where I was to stay that
night.</p>

<p>The name of the place was something like `Notagawa', but I
didn't write it down and I think I have the spelling wrong. To get
there, we had to drive northeast from Kyoto over the picturesque
mountains surrounding the town.</p>

<p>Seventy percent of Japan is mountains rugged enough to be
essentially uninhabitable. When you're in the cities of the coastal
plains this is just a statistic; now I was learning the reality.
The road twisted like a drunken snake through dense forests that
seemed damn close to vertical, drop-offs and ravines at every turn.
Our route roughly paralleled the western shore of Lake Biwa, a
large body of water that half-bisects central Honshu; at some
points we stopped to enjoy views of the lake, cradled by mountains
and sprawling huge in the blue afternoon light. It was not quite an
idyllic natural vista; every square foot of the flat land near the
lake was covered with city.</p>

<p>It was well after dark when we arrived at Chihiro Higuchi's
house. It was a bit small for three people by American standards
(he shares with his mother and a brother), but not the kind of
cramped rabbit hutch described as typical in many books about
Japan. He told me he hoped to get a bigger place someday, but also
that he knew they were fortunate to have as much space as they
did.</p>

<p>The house proved a study in contrasts. The plumbing was
shockingly primitive by American standards, but the kitchen
featured electronically-controlled appliances more sophisticated
than we have in the U.S. The walls were plastered, but many of the
interiors had been painted in the style of shoji screens.
Higuchi-san and his family wore only Western clothing, but one
corner of the room where I slept was an alcove containing the
family shrine; stiff color photographs of ancestors hung near
Shinto idols and an elegant calligraphed scroll. At one point
Higuchi-san apologized to me because, he said, his mother (who
spoke no English) had never met a foreigner before and was a bit
flustered; but she seemed perfectly gracious to me, and wore a
print dress and apron uncannily like what one might see on an older
housewife in the American midwest.</p>

<p>I got a better look at the town while walking to the local train
station with Higuchi-san the next morning. Like his house, the town
looked a bit poor but clean and proud; full of busy people, perhaps
only a generation removed from deep rural poverty, working their
way up in the world. Trucks and motorcycles roared through the
narrow sidewalk-less streets, passing (it seemed) scant inches from
our elbows. Well-scrubbed, lively children in the expected navy
uniforms were making their way to school. And the local rail net we
connected to was less spectacular than the shinkansen but just as
efficient.</p>

<p>I was sorry to leave Kyoto; the place has a unique charm and
peacefulness about it, and I knew as I boarded the shinkansen north
to Tokyo that I wanted to return there someday. But my seatmate on
the ride north was a young woman who knew some English and was
willing to talk. We chipped away amicably at the language barrier.
She turned out to be a CD-ROM artist, recently married, on her way
to work at Fujitsu. We compared laptops (hers was a nifty little
Vaio) and she recoiled in mock horror when she learned mine was a
NEC (I gathered NEC and Fujitsu have some kind of particular
rivalry going).</p>

<p>When I actually pulled my machine out of its case to work on
this narrative, she flashed a mischievous grin and softly sang a
couple bars of the Evil Empire theme from Star Wars at me. I made
the obvious no-that's-Microsoft joke and we shared a good laugh.
Turned out she'd heard about Linux, which I thought was a good sign
for the level of grass-roots awareness in Japan.</p>

<p>She offered me a little ring-shaped Japanese five-yen coin as a
souvenir, and I gave her an American quarter in return. Later she
pointed out the upper cone of Mt. Fuji for me. Our line of sight to
the lower slopes was blocked by nearer hills; even so, it was an
impressive sight. The many kilometers of air between our train and
the mountain tinted the rock to a blue nearly indistinguishable
from that of the sky itself, so that most of what one could see was
the reflective brilliance of the snow around the summit. It looked
both massive and ethereal, a fit place to grow myths of gods and
demons.</p>

<p>At Tokyo Station I linked up with Takako Mitake and Taizo
Sueyasu, my interpreters for the afternoon. We caught a train to
Kamakura, where the second famous Great Buddha of Japan is located
(second because it's later, from the Edo period after 1600). This
one is outdoors; it was originally located within a series of
temples, but the buildings around it kept being destroyed by fire,
earthquake, or tsunami and eventually the Japanese gave it up as a
bad job. Now the twenty-one-foot high Buddha meditates in the
sunshine, gazing out over the sea.</p>

<p>From there we went to Kase Kannon temple, an elaborate complex
of Pure Land Buddhist sites on a wooded hillside by the sea. Not my
favorite kind of Buddhism; it's theistic and elaborate and in both
theory and practice rather too close to chiliastic Christianity for
my taste or anyone else's safety (it's the only religion other than
Christianity and Islam to have practiced conversion by the sword).
Still, it was interesting; the site was beautiful, and through
Takako's explanations I learned a lot about the divination and
luck-charm practices of folk Buddhism. These, apparently, are very
much still alive.</p>

<p>There are caves set deep into the sandstone of the hillside at
Kase Kannon that are special places of pilgrimage. If you walk
inside them, you'll see bas-reliefs of gods and Buddhas carved out
of the living rock, each lit by racks of flickering candles left by
pilgrims, some as much as thirteen hundred years old. The passages
extend hundreds of feet back into the hillside; at some places, you
have to bend double to walk through low tunnels. The mind boggles
to think how many people-centuries of patient devotion went into
the shaping of those caves.</p>

<p>Then, outside, you can look out over the bay, with the town
spread out below you and mountains plunging into the sea all
around. It's a view worthy of a silk painting.</p>

<p>The streets of Kamakura were rather an education in themselves.
The resemblance to Higuchi-san's little town in Shiga Prefecture
was clear, but the intensity turned up a notch. Unlike the
comparatively sterile glass-and-steel canyons of central Tokyo,
there was vigorous street life here; open-fronted shops selling
goods of every description. We stopped for soft ice cream at one
place where the flavor range was vanilla, green tea, and sweet
potato. Little noodle shops and restaurants were everywhere. My
guides motioned me into one souvenir place that advertised swords,
but as I rather expected they were poor-quality blunted replicas. I
could get better ones in the U.S.</p>

<p>That same day in Kamakura featured the only time I saw
traditional Japanese costume on the street. An elderly woman in
kimono was being escorted by a younger, taller woman in fashionable
Western clothing, obviously a daughter or niece. They were out
shopping.</p>

<p>We caught the train back to Tokyo and visited a famous Shinto
shrine called Hachiman built by the Tokugawa shoguns at the height
of their power. One of them was assassinated by his own nephew
there; the tree behind which the assassin hid, a massive and
knotted thousand-year-old gingko, looms over the long stairway to
the shrine.</p>

<p>The shrine itself is less impressive; but this is fitting, as
the sacredness of Shinto sites is supposed to be in their setting,
in the special tree or oddly-shaped rock or waterfall where the
kami resides. I bowed three times and clapped twice to show respect
to the kami of the place, but I did not pray there. My tribe has
its own set of kami (I told my guides) and while it is proper to
respect all kami, it's best to direct your ceremonies to the kami
of your own ancestors. This was the best approximate explanation of
neopaganism I could fit into a Japanese context.</p>

<p>Back at my hotel, I picked up a fax that turned out to be from
Maya. She had two followup questions to our interview -- and also
wanted me to know that she adored my poem. Bliss. I called her
back, answered her questions, and learned there was no chance she'd
be able to visit Tokyo before I left. Alas...</p>

<p>A few minutes later I met Akira Kurahone and some colleagues
from the Unix Business Association. They had brought along the
woman who would be interpreting for my talk the next day. We went
to dinner at a teppanyaki grill on the penthouse level with the
objective of helping prepare her to translate my talk. She was
startled to hear that I had no prepared text, and I was terrified
by the words ``consecutive translation''. Kyoto had left scars on
me that way -- having to stop every sentence or three conflicted
violently with the casual, humorous, discursive speaking style that
I have found most effective. We concentrated on reviewing the
technical terms and proper names I would be likely to use in my
talk.</p>

<p>The following morning, Akira Kurahone met me at my hotel and we
went to the National Historical Museum in Ueno. I lucked out; they
were having a special exhibit of swords and armor. The oldest piece
there was a thousand-year-old Heian straight sword -- a long,
double-edged unfullered blade with a spade tip that looked
curiously like Viking blades of the same period in Europe. This one
shined like it had been made yesterday.</p>

<p>The rest of the exhibit showed the evolution of the classical
Japanese sword from the older tachi (curved longsword) style to the
more familiar katana and wakizashi, the smaller ``dai-sho'' or two
swords worn by feudal and Edo-period samurai. These blades were
clearly national treasures cared for lovingly through generations;
they gleamed proud and beautiful under the museum lights. But their
un-marred and polished steel looked thoroughly modern, form
following function in a deadly and graceful simplicity.</p>

<p>In another abrupt ancient-to-modern transition, Kurahone-san and
I went from the museum to Akihabara. This section of Tokyo, often
known by its English name ``Electric City'', is an area of several
square blocks packed tight with computer and electronics shops. It
combines the feel of an Oriental bazaar with the latest high
technology in an arresting way. Warrens of little shops will sell
you entire computers or any sub-assembly you like, down to the chip
and LED and cable level. My companion told me that assembling PCs
to your own specs is a very popular form of tinkering in Japan,
just as it was in the U.S. before plunging hardware prices made
entire systems cheaper than the time and aggravation cost of
rolling your own. He also pointed out the little Shinto box shrines
tucked in odd corners between the stalls.</p>

<p>I also got a better look at street-level Tokyo than I had before
that morning. The dense-packed buildings nearly covered with garish
signs, the crowds, the stained concrete...it looks like the city in
the movie ``Bladerunner'' would in daytime. It really does. And
another thing: Japan really is, as Patricia Yarrow commented at one
point, ``girl-watcher's heaven''. Thousands of pretty Asian women
throng the Tokyo streets, a good many of them wearing tight
clothing or black catsuits or that boots-and-miniskirt thing that's
about guaranteed to make any heterosexual male fall on his knees
and howl at the moon. ``I don't know how guys here keep it
together,'' Patricia said, ``I really don't.''</p>

<p>My talk was (as I expected) successful but horribly frustrating.
Patricia Yarrow and Stephen Carter had come to hear it, and helped
break the ice in the question-and-answer period. The hosts threw a
reception afterwards at which I found myself in a bit of a
quandary; after a couple of speakers had made remarks that didn't
cross the language barrier to me, the organizers gestured me to the
microphone and I didn't have any idea what sort of thing to say.
Stephen came to my rescue and muttered that I was supposed to make
formal remarks thanking the hosts and saying how much I had enjoyed
my stay in Japan and predicting a bright future for the country in
open-source software. Fortunately I was able to do these things
quite sincerely.</p>

<p>Afterwards we tucked into a lavish mix of Japanese and Western
food; at one point I found myself eating french fries with
chopsticks. Patricia found this amusing and appropriate; she told
me she had become used to eating Western-style salads the same way.
On a moment's reflection, I agreed that this seemed like a very
good idea; chopsticks are better adapted than Western utensils to
food that comes in small pieces that are messy to eat with fingers.
I think I might have to start doing this in the U.S.</p>

<p>Patricia and I met at noon the following day to go over to Hombu
Dojo, the world HQ of aikido. My sensei had asked me to pick up
some rank pins for him. I wasn't averse to watching a few classes
at this exalted place -- who knows, some of it might rub off on me.
Also Patricia and I had thought it might be fun to work out
together.</p>

<p>We did all these things, and I discovered that Patricia is a
very capable teacher who is about ready to open the school that her
3rd Dan officially entitles her to run. Sadly, the logistics of
getting there and back out to the airport meant we only had a short
time to play together, but I learned a thing or two. I bought us
both Hombu Dojo T-shirts and she accepted my offer to teach her
Gun-Fu 101 if she's ever in my part of the world. And when we
hugged just before I got on the airport bus I felt I had made a
friend.</p>

<p>Thinking back, I can't imagine how I could possibly have gotten
a better cross-section of Japan in seven days. From Tokyo to Kyoto
to a provincial town in the sticks; from plains to mountains; from
bustling streets to tranquil Zen temples. Historical sights
spanning nearly fifteen hundred years, and <em>both</em> Great
Buddhas. Adventure (the food), enlightenment (crazy Master Ozeki)
and even romance (sweet Maya). I even managed to do the
American-martial-artist-in-Japan thing.</p>

<p>In important ways I did find what I was originally looking for
in Japan. Much has been lost; the contexts that created Heian
nobles and swaggering samurai and the courtesans of the Willow
World are gone forever, and I found that average Japanese
themselves are often less aware of the heights and history of their
own ancestral culture than a foreigner who has taken the trouble to
study it carefully. But much remains. The swords at Ueno sing of
superb craftsmanship and lethal beauty. Ryoan-ji still breathes
forth its astonishing serenity, like cool clear water for the
thirsty soul. And beneath the busy urban surface the folkways of
the past are still quietly alive, like the Shinto shrinelets tucked
amidst Electric City's bustling stalls.</p>
