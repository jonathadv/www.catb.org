<p class='notebox'>I wrote this about 1990. The <cite>Philadelphia
Inquirer</cite> published an edited version as an Op-Ed piece in
"Community Voices" on Sunday, February 8 1998.</p>
<br />

<p>What happened to the civil rights movement?</p>

<p>That's a question that often preoccupies me these days when I
have time to think about politics. I remember, many years ago,
being thrilled at the story of Rosa Parks, the brave black woman
who decided she wasn't going to be shuffled to the back of the bus
anymore. I was too young to hear or understand Martin Luther King's
"I have a dream" speech when it happened, but I heard the
recordings, after he'd died at an assassin's hand, and knew I was
hearing a voice of moral force nearly without equal in our
century.</p>

<p>I'm white. My parents scrupulously taught me to judge people as
King exhorted us to &mdash; not by the color of their skins, but by the
character of their souls. But I never had any black playmates. I
was nearly adult before I lived in an American city, saw black
people every day, began to understand in my gut the terrible wrongs
that had been done them and the anger that back-lit Rosa Parks's
stubbornness and Dr. King's ringing calls for justice.</p>

<p>It's been nearly thirty years now since the Freedom Riders. For
me, personally, fifteen years since "the race problem" became real
to me in the streets of West Philadelphia. I wish I could have kept
my anger and my convictions as pure as they were then. But
something ugly and sad happened as I grew older, something that
leached the nobility out of black America's cause and squandered
most of the moral capital it had won fighting the Ku Klux Klan and
the Jim Crow laws and the lynching rope.</p>

<p>I think Dr. King's heirs forgot their fight was for
<em>freedom</em>. I think they forgot his vision of a world in
which color wouldn't matter. I don't know how or why it happened. I
know the symptoms. I remember the Bakke case. I remember when I
first heard the phrase "affirmative action". I couldn't believe
that a people who'd suffered so much from laws that used the color
of a man's skin to keep him down would press for laws that
<em>required</em> the government to act like a racist.</p>

<p>I still don't believe what we've come to. The second age of the
racial double standard, a sick parody of the bad old days when a
black man was presumed guilty. Marion Barry abuses the D.C. mayor's
office and snorts crack on video and `movement' blacks march in the
streets to get him acquitted. `Afro-centrists' agitate for their
own (segregated) schools and curricula that would consciously try
to write the white man out of the black child's version of history.
Race-norming. Quotas. `Diversity' enforcers coercing students and
academics throughout America's universities to avoid any action or
speech or even thought that might be `racially offensive', while
never doubting their own entitlement to treat anyone with a white
skin as an unindicted co-conspirator in the Plot to Oppress Blacks
&mdash; guilty until proven innocent. When did the fight for freedom
decay into this obscene scramble for handouts and privileges and
discrimination for <em>our</em> color this week, please?</p>

<p>And the band plays on, while our black inner cities rot away and
one out of every four of young black males graduates from a
maelstrom of drugs, violence, and broken families to do time in our
jails. Yes, I'm still angry. I hate racism as passionately as I
ever did, and I still stand for any black man's right to be judged
equally with me. But now I'm as incensed with black politicians as
I ever was with white segregationists. It wasn't just a black man's
dream they betrayed; it was mine, too. I believed.</p>

<p>I wish I could believe again. Where is the leadership that will
tell blacks that they can't end racism by supporting laws that
institutionalize it? Where is the man or woman who can give the
black underclass a positive vision that goes beyond resentment,
dependence on government largesse, and the victim syndrome? Who
will wake up the poor blacks in our cities to the fact that they've
become their own worst enemies, slaughtering each other in numbers
the Klan could only dream of, yearly racking up casualty figures
reminiscent of a medium-sized war? Who will speak the hard truth:
that, against this hideous backdrop, continued attempts at the
moral blackmail of innocent whites with reminders of past racism
will only drive them into the arms of hatemongers like David
"Sieg-Heil" Duke and his scummy gang of knock-off Nazis?</p>

<p>I am not now nor have I ever been a conservative. But the last
thirty years have made it clear that the conservatives have at
least one thing right; <em>only responsibility works.</em> Only
hard work and courage and Rosa Parks's stubborn refusal to accept
the limits of habit and custom broke the chains that white racism
once forged on black people; and only those qualities can break the
new chains that, through all these years of welfarism and
finger-pointing and guilt-mongering and gimme-gimme politics, much
of black America has been busily forging on itself.</p>

<p>I spent a good chunk of last Memorial Day weekend playing conga
drums with a multiracial group. I wore a dashiki under my blue eyes
and the black woman playing across from me sported a polo shirt
right out of some preppie catalog and no one there thought either
the least bit odd. Black, white, yellow...didn't matter. Africa's
wild thundering rhythms beat through all of us and the people
around clapped and danced and yelled for joy. I think Dr. King
would have approved. <em>That's</em> the world I want to live in. I
hope we can all find our way to it someday.</p>
