convention programming smoothly.  Here are some high points:</p><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="sect2"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="id2765366"/>Recruit gofers</h3></div></div><p>To reduce the load on the convention staff, recruit
<span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i>gofers</i></span>.  Ask convention attendees to help work the
convention.  Have a signup sheet, and a gofer monitor who tracks the hours
they work.  Here are some uses for gofers:</p><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Show setup/teardown</p></li><li><p>Moving AV equipment</p></li><li><p>Running messages</p></li><li><p>Printing things</p></li><li><p>Purchasing runs for office supplies and food</p></li><li><p>Rounding up missing speakers</p></li><li><p>Manning the registration desk</p></li><li><p>Room monitor duty (see below)</p></li></ul></div><p>Recruit gofers with a pitch in your program book.  Also, announce the
gofer program (and its rewards) in your web pages so you get gofer
signups early.  Reward them with one or more of the following:</p><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Partial or complete refund of show admission, pro-rated to 
the number of hours they work.</p></li><li><p>Convention T-shirt.  For style points, mark the shirt
&quot;Staff&quot; or &quot;Gofer&quot; and make it unavailable to regular
attendees.</p></li><li><p>Admission to the ``gofer
hole'', a staging area with food and places to nap.</p></li></ul></div><p>These perks can make gofer status a powerful lure for broke students.
It's a win-win deal; they get a less expensive conference, the staff
gets warm bodies to do gruntwork.</p><p>In general, if the core staff has to do much besides making decisions
and managing gofers, that means they're working too hard.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="sect2"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="id2765490"/>Room monitors and rovers</h3></div></div><p>Every program item needs a room monitor.  The room monitor's job is to
make sure AV equipment is in place, route last-minute requests from
the speaker to the con staff, and give the speaker a high-sign five
minutes before the time slot ends.</p><p>Typically you want two monitors per program track, alternating.  While
one is in the room assisting a speaker, the other is waiting in the
green room for the next speaker.</p><p>You also need rovers.  A rover is a troubleshooter not assigned to
a specific area.  Room monitors can be gofers, but rovers should be
core staff with decision-making authority.  Give them radios with
a link to the convention operations room.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="sect2"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="id2765522"/>Have a `green room'</h3></div></div><p>At SF conventions it's traditional to have a `green room' which is
a staging area for speakers (the term is borrowed from show business,
in which the green room is where actors wait for their turn on stage).</p><p>The green room should have water, snacks, places to sit.  But it's
more than a perk for speakers; it's also a way to keep control of
them.  Your speakers should be urged to check in at the green room 
ten or fifteen minutes before their talk.  There they can be met by
their room monitor and escorted to their talk venue.</p><p>If you run your green room and your room monitors properly, you'll 
find you can avoid the accumulating schedule slippage that's otherwise
common at technical conventions.  That never happens at SF conventions.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="sect2"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="id2765555"/>Use badge ribbons</h3></div></div><p>Another un-obvious friction cost is the time cost of finding people
whose faces you don't know.  Often (for the staff) these are people
in special categories like core staff, gofers, speakers, press people, and
vendor reps.</p><p>SF fans address this problem with badge ribbons -- one color for core
staff, another for gofers, another for press, etc.  This makes it
much easier to scan a room and quickly locate (for example) the core
staff members.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="sect2"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="id2811223"/>Show up a day early</h3></div></div><p>Plan for last-minute panics.  It always happens, no matter how hard
you plan for other things.  To cope, <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="emphasis"><i>show up a day early</i></span>.
Total up all the hours you think are needed for setup, then give
yourselves the extra day.</p><p>If you do this, you'll actually have time to print programs, put up
signs, and do all the other little things that you grossly
underestimated the necessary time for.  You'll also get a good night's
sleep before the show opening -- that's important.</p></div></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s02.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s04.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Shaping the social space </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Peer-to-peer communications</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
