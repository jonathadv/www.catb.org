attendees.  Here are a couple of techniques for addressing this
and supporting other kinds of peer-to-peer communications:</p><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="sect2"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="id2811130"/>Have a voodoo board</h3></div></div><p>A `voodoo board' is a message drop for attendees.  It's a big cork
board covered by a printout of all the pre-registered attendees'
names, with a checkbox next to each.  Next to the board, place 
a little table bearing a box of push-pins, an index-card-sized filebox
with alphabet dividers, a couple of ballpoint pens, and a bunch of
small memo pads.</p><p>Instructions posted above the board should explain how to use it. 
When an attendee arrives, he/she should put a check next to his/her
name.</p><p>To leave a message, write it on the memo pad and file it in the box
under the initial of the recipient's last name.  Then put a push-pin
next to the name.</p><p>To check for messages, just look for a push-pin next to your name.  
If there is one, retrieve your memo and remove the push-pin.</p><p>This setup may be low-tech but it works really well.  Ideally, it
should be placed just off the daytime focal area of the convention.
One of the things it does is prevent the rest of your message boards
from getting clogged with person-to-person notices.</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="sect2"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="id2761929"/>Have a grafitti wall.</h3></div></div><p>Cover a large section of wall with butcher paper.  Have felt-tip pens
nearby.  Mark the top ``GRAFITTI WALL'' in huge bloob letters.  Seed
it with a few jokes and a cartoon.  Stand back...</p></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="sect2"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="id2761944"/>Recognition dots</h3></div></div><p>This is a fun hack I saw at Linux Expo '98 that I'm going to import
back to SF fandom.  Recognition dots are signals about your interests that
you can attach to your convention badge.</p><p>Have an easel or section of wall, again covered with butcher paper,
marked ``RECOGNITION DOTS -- MAKE UP YOUR OWN''.  Nearby, have a table
bearing few packets of multicolored gummed-paper dots (all stationery
stores carry these), a several felt-tip pens (again in multiple
colors), and a scissors.</p><p>Seed the display with a few pre-designed recognition dots.  For
example a red dot with a dollar sign on it might identify Perl fans,
or a blue dot with `P' Python fans.  A yellow dot with &quot;MS&quot; underneath
and an international `forbidden' graphic over it might have ``I hate
Microsoft!'' next to it.  Or a green dot with &quot;/.&quot; on it might be for
Slashdot regulars.  Or a big roman-numeral two (for the Second
Amendment) on a blue dot for geeks with guns.</p><p>You want to encourage people to design their own dots for 
constituencies you didn't think of in advance.  People will
get very creative and funny about this given half a chance.</p></div></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s03.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="index.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s05.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Programming without bugs </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Staff Organization</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
