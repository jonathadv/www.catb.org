<h1>SCO's Evidence: This Smoking Gun Fizzles Out</h1>

<p>Version 1.0 -- first general release 20 August 2003.</p>

<p>Version 1.1 -- note significance of the <a href="#no_c">missing 32V copyright</a>.</p>

<p>Version 1.2 -- corrected description of the locking calls, added SIII.</p>

<p><em>Executive summary: There are three pieces of good news for SCO
about the evidence they revealed on 18 August 2003.  One is that the
evidence does support a claim of code-copying; the second is that GPL
is not in this case a usable defense; and the third is that BSD
probably doesn't save us either.  But the rest of the news is all bad
for SCO: most of the supposedly infringing code was (a) released as open
source by SCO/Caldera in 2002, (b) didn't come through IBM or Sequent,
(c) isn't present in 90% of all running Linux distributions, and (d)
was removed from Linux 2.5 in July 2003 on grounds of being too ugly
to live.  If this is representative of the quality of SCO's evidence,
their case is dead on arrival.</em></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>At SCOforum on 18 August 2003, SCO displayed a piece of what it
called evidence that it owns huge portions of the Linux source code.
This is one of the central contention in its <a
href='http://www.opensource.org/sco-vs-ibm.html'>billion-dollar
lawsuit against IBM</a>. The 'evidence' was two presentation slides
showing, side by side, code SCO labeled "System V" and
&ldquo;Linux&rdquo;. The first is captioned &ldquo;Line by line
Copying &mdash; One Example of Many &rdquo;</p>

<p>It's now barely 24 hours since the slides leaked.  There have
been a couple of early analyses published already on <a
href="http://slashdot.org/articles/03/08/19/1523236.shtml?tid=106&tid=185">Slashdot</a>
and <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/45019/">Linux Weekly News</a>.
I've written this one because (a) none of these were aimed at a
general or journalistic audience, and (b) they miss or don't highlight
some interesting details that bear on SCO's case against IBM and the
legality of its licensing program.  Also, I'm doing what others have
not dared: I'm publishing the differences with the relevant System V
code.</p>

<h2>The evidence</h2>

<p>Let's begin by looking at the actual evidence.  The original slides
are <a
href="http://www.heise.de/newsticker/data/jk-19.08.03-000/imh0.jpg">here</a>
and <a
href="http://www.heise.de/newsticker/data/jk-19.08.03-000/imh1.jpg">here</a>.
SCO's display was incomplete, and part of the "System V" comment was
obfuscated by being transliterated into Greek letters.  After undoing
the obfuscation, we have the following header comment from what SCO
labels "System V" code:</p>

<p>Slide 1, left side ("System V code"):</p>

<pre>
/*
 * Allocate 'size' units from the given map.
 * Return the base of the allocated space.
 * In a map, the addresses are increasing and the
 * list is terminated by a 0 size.
 * The swap map unit is 512 bytes
 * Algorithm is first-fit.
 *
 * As part of the kernel evolution toward modular naming, the functions
 * malloc, and mfree are being renamed to rmalloc and rmfree.
 * Compatibility will be maintained by the following assembly code:
 * (also see mfree/rmfree below)
 */
</pre>


<p>Slide 1, right side ("Linux Kernel Code"):</p>

<pre>
/*
 * Allocate 'size' units from the given map.
 * Return the base of the allocated space.
 * In a map, the addresses are increasing and the
 * list is terminated by a 0 size.
 * Algorithm is first-fit.
 */

ulong_t
atealloc(
	struct map *mp,
	size_t size)
{
	register unsigned int a;
	register struct map *bp;
	register unsigned long s;
</pre>


<p>Slide 2 simply shows a portion of the Linux kernel code:</p>

<pre>
	if (size == 0)
		return((ulong_t) NULL);

	s = mutex_spinlock(maplock(mp));

	for (bp = mapstart(mp); bp->m_size; bp++) {
		if (bp->m_size >= size) {
			a = bp->m_addr;
			bp->m_addr += size;
			if ((bp->m_size -= size) == 0) {
				do {
					bp++;
					(bp-1)->m_addr = bp->m_addr;
				} while ((((bp-1)->m_size) = (bp->m_size)));
				mapsize(mp)++;
			}

			ASSERT(bp->m_size < 0x80000000);
			mutex_spinunlock(maplock(mp), s);
</pre>

<p>Observe that SCO does not actually show the System V code, but only the 
comment.</pre>

<p>On the Linux side, this code is in the 2.4 file <a
href='http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/marcelo/linux-2.4/arch/ia64/sn/io/ate_utils.c'>arch/ia64/sn/io/ate_utils.c</a>.
Here is the entire text of the relevant function:</p>

<pre>
/*
 * Allocate 'size' units from the given map.
 * Return the base of the allocated space.
 * In a map, the addresses are increasing and the
 * list is terminated by a 0 size.
 * Algorithm is first-fit.
 */

ulong_t
atealloc(
	struct map *mp,
	size_t size)
{
	register unsigned int a;
	register struct map *bp;
	register unsigned long s;

	ASSERT(size >= 0);

	if (size == 0)
		return((ulong_t) NULL);

	s = mutex_spinlock(maplock(mp));

	for (bp = mapstart(mp); bp->m_size; bp++) {
		if (bp->m_size >= size) {
			a = bp->m_addr;
			bp->m_addr += size;
			if ((bp->m_size -= size) == 0) {
				do {
					bp++;
					(bp-1)->m_addr = bp->m_addr;
				} while ((((bp-1)->m_size) = (bp->m_size)));
				mapsize(mp)++;
			}

			ASSERT(bp->m_size < 0x80000000);
			mutex_spinunlock(maplock(mp), s);
			return(a);
		}
	}

	/*
	 * We did not get what we need .. we cannot sleep .. 
	 */
	mutex_spinunlock(maplock(mp), s);
	return(0);
}
</pre>

<p>The code in question is a memory-allocation routine intended to be
used by other code in the kernel.  We can't see exactly which code SCO
is referring to in its Unixware tree, but there is indeed a very
similar implementation in several Unixes.</pre>

<p>Almost the earliest version of Unix for which sources are still
extant is Fifth Edition (aka Version 5 or V5), released 1974.  Here is
the <a
href='http://minnie.tuhs.org/UnixTree/V5/usr/sys/ken/malloc.c.html'>Fifth
Edition</a> version of the code in question. with a copyright date of
1973.</p>

	for (bp = mp; bp->m_size; bp++) {

			a = bp->m_addr;
			bp->m_addr =+ size;
			if ((bp->m_size =- size) == 0)
				do {
					bp++;
					(bp-1)->m_addr = bp->m_addr;
				} while ((bp-1)->m_size = bp->m_size);
			return(a);
		}
	}
	return(0);
}
</pre>

<p>Here is the <a
href='http://minnie.tuhs.org/UnixTree/V6/usr/sys/ken/malloc.c.html'>Sixth
Edition</a> (or V6) version from 1976.  An added comment is
highlighted in <font color='red'>red</font>; otherwise the code is

<p>The System III version from 1981 is identical to the 32V version 
except that there's a trivial whitespace change in the comment.</p>

<p>Allowing for comment tweaks and minor language changes, the
V5/V6/V7/32V/SIII versions are identical.  This is very stable code
implementing a simple algorithm.  We'll call it the
&ldquo;ancient&rdquo; version and take the 32V/SIII code as
representative.</p>

<p>These are small differences.  Most are trivial.  The expression in
the while loop differs only in having two extra layers of parentheses.
The <code>size_t</code> parameter is declared rather than being
allowed to default to an int.  <code>mapstart</code> and
<code>mapsize</code> are trivial macro. The only significant changes
are the addition of the assertions and the lock-map handling.</para>

<p>Another <a

of the same code</a> is in the 2.11 BSD Unix system makes a useful
contrast.  The 2.11 version is much more heavily commented and has
elaborations the 32V version lacks; it is genuinely different. Here it
is:</p>

<p>And now...tadaaa!...the System V Release 4 version, in 
uts/i386/os/malloc.c.   As a way of avoiding a technical copyright
violation, I'm not going to give the SVr4 source itself.  (I acquired
it back in the 1980s when bootleg System V source trees were fairly
commonly passed around among System V administrators and developers;
vendors knew of this but ignored it as long as the tapes weren't used
to create unlicensed installations.)  Instead of showing the code, I'm
going to show you something that is actually more informative; a
diff between the SVr4 version and the Linux version. </p>

<p>Any SCO lawyers tempted to make a fuss over the publication of these
diffs or my access to the SVr4 code should think carefully about the
sorts of things that happen to corporations with already poor
reputations who try to sue journalists engaged in fact publication
with respect to a dispute of wide public interest.</p>

<p>In fact, publishing the code itself would arguably have been legal.
In his ruling on the 1993 denial of injunction that led to the
settlement, the judge <a
href='http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/bsdi/930303.ruling.txt'>expressed
doubt</a> that AT&amp;T held any legitimate copyright in the bulk of
the Unix code at all (see my <a
href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/nosecrets/">No Secrets</a> page for
related discussion).  If I were SCO's lawyers, the last thing I'd want
is to re-open that can of worms.   What stopped me wasn't legal
risk but the ethical problem; I respect intellectual-property rights
and don't want to violate SCO's even incidentally, even after the
blatant disregard they've shown for my rights as an issuer of code
under the GPL.</p>

<p>Here is the diff. Lines beginning with &lt; mark lines not actually
present in the Linux version; lines beginning with &gt; mark lines in
the Linux code not in the SVr4 code.  The format has been chosen to
illustrate the fact that the differences between the SVr4 and Linux
versions are mostly trivial syntax-level stuff.  But there are real
differences: the fact that the System V function is split in two
(<code>rmalloc</code> and the <code>malloc</code> wrapper) and the
calls to the lock/unlock functions.</p>

<p>Knowing what I do about the functional changes in UnixWare since
SVr4, I would bet the price of a good steak dinner that the UnixWare
version of this code is effectively identical to the SVr4
version.</p>

<h2>The similarities</h2>

<p>All these pieces of code are sufficiently similar to
convince me (or any other competent C programmer) the Linux, 2.11BSD
and System V Release 4 versions all derive from the ancient
version.  The System V and Linux versions really differ from the common
ancestor only in that they both contain something that looks like
mutual-exclusion locking.</p>

<p>Actually the SVr4 calls aren't strictly locking calls but just
interrupt disablers; the difference has to do with the fact that
SVr4 was not SMP-capable. The SVr4 calls are there to block
interrupts (a way of ensuring that the inner code of the function
cannot be interrupted by disk events or timer ticks), the Linux ones are
there to enable symmetric multiprocessing without corrupting the memory
pool. The difference is significant.</p>

<p>The ancient, System V and Linux versions are more alike than any of
them resembles the BSD code.  The differences among them are exactly
the sorts that would be introduced by evolutionary drift as copied
code was adapted over time. </p>

<p>In retrospect, there was a clue in the Linux code all along that it
had been copied from rather old sources rather than being written
fresh: the <code>register</code> declarations.  Those do by hand an
optimization that modern C compilers do automatically, and most
programmers lost the habit of inserting them in new code a good ten
years ago.  So the honest question is: where was Linux's
<code>atemalloc</code> copied from?</p>

<p>To clarify matters, here is a rough similarity tree of the versions of
this code.  Each arrow is a probable copied-to relationship.  Relative
distances indicate code similarity; the main point is that the SVr4
code and Linux code are relatively close together, about equally
dissimilar from 32V, with 2.11BSD more different.</p>

<pre>
                                      +------> SVr4
                                      |
                   ancient Unix ----+-|
                                    | |
                                    | +------> Linux
                                    |

                                    +------> 2.11BSD
</pre>

<p>(Sorry for the ASCII graphics, but I wanted this document
to be self-contained HTML.)</p>

<p>One thing that backs up this this reconstruction of the
evolutionary tree is that these relationships match the chronology of
the releases, as described for example in <a
href='http://www.levenez.com/unix/'>&Eacute;ric
L&eacute;v&eacute;nez's history chart</a>

<p>So, in alleging copying from old Unix code, SCO is actually on
pretty firm ground here.  What does this suggest about IP rights or
violations in this situation?  It depends in which version the 
code was copied from.</p>

<h2>Who copied from whom?</h2>

<p>Based on the similarity tree, the source from which the Linux code
was copied is least likely to have been BSD.</p>

<p>In 1993 AT&amp;T's Unix Systems Labs (USL) sued BSDI, a company
selling the BSD system, and the University of California, over
allegedly misappropriated code in the BSD system.  Their complaint was
quite similar to SCO's.  They were effectively forced to settle after
a judge found that AT&amp;T had flagrantly misappropriated BSD code
into its kernel.  In the settlement, the University agreed to add an
AT&amp;T copyright notice to some files but gained the right to
continue to distribute all under the BSD license. AT&amp;T agreed to pay
the University's court costs. Some details of the lawsuit are <a
href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/bsdi/bsdisuit.htm">here</a>.</p>

<p>Some analysts have held that existence of the open-source BSD
version is a sufficient shield against charges that the Linux version
was stolen from SCO.  While I expect that will turn out to be the case
for many of the other alleged code overlaps (and indeed I was the <a
href='http://www.opensource.org/sco-vs-ibm.html'>first to suggest this
possibility</a> back in March 2003), I cannot honestly say that I
think it is an applicable defense here. The real question is whether
the Linux implementation was originally copied from ancient Unix or
System V before being modified to fit the Linux environment.</p>

<p>Before trying to determine this, we need to consider the difference
between casual and guilty copying.  Casual copying is the cut-and-paste 
that happens when you're sure you have permission to re-use, or aren't
thinking about it.  Guilty copying is when you know you shouldn't.
Guilty copiers will try to cover their tracks.  The easiest way to do this 
is by changing local variable names, because that sort of change is 
easy to do without breaking code.</p>

<p>The reason we need to make this distinction is that three of the
versions resemble each other so much that if the copier were trying
to cover his tracks we couldn't rely on any textual clues at all.</p>

<p>Thankfully, we are almost certainly dealing with the results of
casual copying here. All the versions use <code>bp</code> as the
principal local variable. None of the differences between the SVr4 and
Linux, or the ancient and Linux versions. look like they were put in to
obfuscate similarities.  So we'll assume that we can actually trust
the textual clues.</p>

<p>Given this, there are two pieces of internal evidence that suggest
the ancient code.  One is that the function is split in two in SVr4
but single in ancient Unix and Linux.  A subtler indication is that one
change between SVr4 and Linux would remove a cast (in the second
<code>ASSERT</code> call).  It is quite unlikely that a programmer
casually copying code would go to the effort to remove a cast, and a
guilty copier wouldn't do it when there are ways to obscure
similarities that are both easier and less likely to spawn subtle
bugs.  This is especially true since a more effective obscuring method
would have been to remove the <code>ASSERT</code>s entirely; they are
used for debugging rather than being necessary to operation and could
be readily dispensed with.</p>

<p>On the other side, the fact that both the SVr4 and Linux versions
contain <code>ASSERT</code> macros and what look like
lock-manipulation calls, while ancient Unix does not, might seem to
argue strongly that the Linux code was copied from SVr4.  But there is
less here than meets the eye.  The first <code>ASSERT</code> actually
<em>differs</em> in a way that isn't trivial (the Linux version
excludes a size argument of zero).  And we've already seen that the
locking calls are doing significantly different things.</p>

<p>Caldera's original complaint asserted that Linux SMP was copied
from SVr4, but their revised complaint dropped this claim.  It is well
documented that Linux SMP was a from-scratch implementation, built by
Alan Cox in 1996 using Caldera-supplied equipment.  In effect, the
locking calls drop out of the diff with ancient Unix; they aren't a
good fingerprint for copying, because they're functionally forced by
two different sets of requirements that didn't exist in 32V.</p>

<p>Actually, the most convincing case for the Linux code having been
copied from SVr4 rests on the <code>mapstart</code> and
<code>mapsize</code> macros.  These occur in the Linux and SVr4
versions but not in the ancient code.  They are not forced by the
requirement to support SMP.  The key to understanding these lies in
the fact that their implementations in Linux and SVr4 are different
&mdash; they're access macros for different data structures.  They
<em>couldn't</em> have been copied from SVr4 and still worked, because
the offsets would have been wrong; rather, it appears that somebody
working on the Linux ia64 port tree who had seen SVr4 code before must
have implemented these macros locally in order to have familiar
interfaces handy.  This would be neither surprising nor
actionable.</p>

<p>Overall, the evidence we have suggests that the Linux code was
copied casually from ancient Unix, rather than maliciously from System
V.  The malicious-copying theory that SCO's case depends on would in
this case fail not only the criminal beyond-a-reasonable-doubt test
but the civil preponderance-of-the-evidence test.</p>

<h2>Intellectual-property implications</h2>

Unfortunately for SCO, the concession that Linux's
<code>atemalloc</code> was probably copied from 32V helps their case
not at all.  Because the relevant ancient-Unix file, the 32V version,
is legally available from <a
href='http://minnie.tuhs.org/UnixTree/32VKern/usr/src/sys/sys/malloc.c.html'>here</a>.</p>

<p>And why is this code available on the net?  Because SCO/Caldera let
the 5th Edition, 6th Edition, Version 7, 32V, and System III code go
out under a BSD-like license in January of 2002, well before the
2.4.19 patch introduced this code into Linux.</p>

<p><a href='http://www.lemis.com/grog/UNIX/'>Here</a> is a copy of the
letter in which Caldera officially announced the release of the
"ancient Unix" source trees. Dion Johnson, who signed the letter,
described himself as "Product Manager and one of many open source
enthusiasts in Caldera Intl."  Mr. Johnson's letter includes a pointer
to the authorizing <a
href='http://www.lemis.com/grog/UNIX/ancient-source-all.pdf'>license
letter</a>.  The authorizing letter fails to mention System III, but a
copy of the SCO page from which it was offered along with the other
ancient Unixes still exists on the <a
href='http://www.archive.org'>Wayback Machine</a>.</p>

<p>More generally, SCO's case is, to say the least, somewhat impaired
by the fact that SCO itself freely released all of the code of
ancestral Unix.  Under the conditions defined by the Ancient Unix
license, issued by SCO/Caldera itself, the Linux kernel developers
could copy the entire ancient Unix source tree into the kernel and
SCO/Caldera would have no proprietary claim on the results
whatsoever.</p>

<p>The fact that closely descendant code appears in System V helps them
not at all. To make their case, they'd have to show that substantial 
code which was <em>not present in any open-source Unix kernel</em> was 
copied into the Linux kernel.  This will, at minimum, be difficult.</p>

<h2>Provenance and other details</h2>

<p>But we're not done. There are at least three more interesting details
about this code.  Here they are:</p>

<ol>
<li>The Linux code is in the ia64 port, not the i386 port as in SVr4.</li>

<li>It came from SGI, not IBM or Sequent.</li>

<li>It was introduced in 2.4.19 and removed in 2.5.</li>

<li>The 32V code has no copyright.</p>
</ol>

<p>Each of these has some significance for SCO's case.  I'll explain.</p>

<p>This code occurs in the ia64 port for the Itanium processor, not in
the main port tree for 32-bit Intel processors.  This means that
upwards of 90% of all Linux users, including the corporate users SCO
is now shaking down for license fees, are running binary Linux
distributions that <em>do not include this code</em>.  That's right,
SCO is threatening them over code that isn't compiled into their
kernels and is probably not present as source anywhere on their
production systems!</p>

<p>The copyright on the Linux file is by Silicon Graphics, Inc &mdash;
which is consistent with what's in many other sources files.  Much of
the NUMA work SCO claims was its own was also contributed by SGI.
None of this much helps SCO's contract-violation case, which is based
on a claim that System V code was wilfully misappropriated by IBM and
Sequent in a conscious attempt to destroy SCO's Unix business.</p>

<p>The timing of the code's introduction and removal is significant in
two ways, one negative and one positive.  Negative first: this
<code>atemalloc</code> code was introduced in 2.4.19.  Thus, GPL would
<em>not be a defense against SCO's charges</em> in this case, because
the last kernel SCO distributed was 2.4.13.</p>


<!-- ftp://ftp.sco.com/pub/scolinux/server/4.0/updates/SRPMS/kernel-source-2.4.19.SuSE-133.nosrc.rpm -->

<p>Now positive: the code was removed from 2.5 in July 2003, not
because of copyright issues but because it was an ugly kluge.  So in
the current version of Linux, this code is not even present in the
ia64 port!</p>

<p>The <a
href='http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=105618426518781&w=2'>thread</a>
surrounding the removal is interesting.  In it, for example, Manfred
Spraul of the kernel list wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
P.S.: I'd propose that the GPL rule that a change must be tagged with
the name of the person who changes (or adds) a file is enforced -
atealloc.c is only tagged with "SGI", thus I don't know who should be
shot for writing that.
</blockquote>

<p>It's difficult to imagine anything less indicative of a conspiracy
(by IBM or anyone else) to mulct SCO of their intellectual property or
obscure the trail of kernel changes.  First, Spraul is advocating that
the origin of changes to the kernel code should be tracked <em>more
closely</em> so their owners can be discovered.  Second, he is doing so
because in this case the result of importing the code was crap.</p>

<a name='no_c'><h2>The Curious Case of the Missing Copyright</h2></a>

<p>The 1979 <a
href='http://minnie.tuhs.org/UnixTree/32VKern/usr/src/sys/sys/malloc.c.html'>32V
code</a> has no explicit copyright in it.  This matters, because under
U.S. copyright law before 1996, AT&amp;T failed the
limited-publication test for retaining implicit copyright in a
published work.  This is why the judge in the AT&amp;T-vs.BSD lawsuit
issued a <a
href='http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/bsdi/930303.ruling.txt'>ruling</a>
doubting that AT&amp;T could sustain its copyright claim, which in
turn is why
AT&amp;T settled.  They knew that if it came to a stand-up fight in a
courtroom, they would probably lose <em>all</em> rights in the code.</p>

<p>The law was changed in 1996 in ways that made implicit copyrights
much stronger and easier to defend.  (No, this wasn't a nefarious plot
by the RIAA, it was to bring U.S. Law in line with the international Berne
Convention on copyrights.)</p>

<p>SCO, as AT&amp;T's successor in interest, is thus heir to a serious
problem.  There have been so many copies of the ancient Unix sources
floating around for so long that it's genuinely unclear whether they
have copyright control over them.  Those of you like me with sources
of System V that we acquired before 1996 can't be sued for possession,
both because of the pre-1996 rules and because the three-year
limitation on copyright prosecutions is long exceeded.  (We could
still be sued for republishing them; that would be a new violation.)</p>

<p>And, in fact, with respect to any code copying that might have
been done more than three years ago, SCO has no ability to recover
damages for copyright violation whether the sources leaked out
before or after 1996.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>So, in summary, SCO is right where it doesn't matter and wrong where
it does. Yes, it does appear that in this case code was copied into
Linux from older Unix versions.  But because the relevant ancestral
code was released in open source by SCO/Caldera before it was
incorporated, SCO/Caldera has no case here.</p>

<p>You might wish to read <a
href='http://www.lemis.com/grog/SCO/code-comparison.html'>Greg Lehey's
analysis</a> of this code. He differs on some points but reaches the 
same overall conclusion.</p>
