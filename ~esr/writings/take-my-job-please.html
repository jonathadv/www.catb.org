<p>Take my job, please.</p>

<p>What job is this? Um...that would be public advocate for the
hacker tribe, speaker-to-journalists, evangelist/interface to the
corporate world.</p>

<p>It's an important job, because ideas don't sell themselves.
Better technology can't win by itself without good propaganda, not
when you're taking on both the inertia of the corporate mind and
the entrenched power of a market leader determined to wield any FUD
it has to to crush all competition. The media and the corporate
moguls need to see a face they think they can trust and hear a
story they can believe, told in their language. Otherwise, no
matter how clever and good and pure we are, we'll be swamped by the
next billion-dollar marketing blitz from Redmond.</p>

<p>It's a great job, too. You get to fly all over the U.S. and the
world and stay in luxury hotels a lot. You're quoted as an
authority in the national press. Fortune 500 executives listen
carefully when you talk. Gray eminences in the Pentagon ask you to
speak at national-security workshops. You meet all kinds of
interesting and powerful people (why, in just the last two weeks
I've had face time with Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, John Sculley, Mitch
Kapor, Esther Dyson, and the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury In
Charge Of Russia). You get asked to write columns in national
magazines. You're treated like visiting royalty by Linux user
groups. You get to have your bio in <cite>Wired</cite> (next
month). You get to make history. You even get groupies (well, OK,
this has only happened once. But she was <em>fine</em>.)</p>

<p>So, like, if the job is so important and so cool, why do I want
to get rid of it?</p>

<p>Mainly because of all the more important things you lose doing
it. Like your privacy and your time and a lot of your personal
life. To do the job right, you have to be on the road half the time
and fielding requests from journalists most of the other half. You
start to miss your wife and your cat and your home pretty badly
after two weeks in hotels, and living out of a backpack and eating
airline food gets old much sooner. I've been doing this for a year
now.</p>

<p>But there's worse. You'll find you have to fight to find any
time to really think or reflect about the things that put you on
that road in the first place. And you barely have the energy to
actually hack code any more. You listen to yourself spinning words
to strangers in suits instead, and feel like a plant being pulled
slowly out of the ground -- roots not tearing, yet, but feeling the
strain, feeling the strain.</p>

<p>That's not what will hurt you the most, though. What will hurt
you the most is the people you love, the tribe you've sweated blood
to serve. Because they'll turn on you. They will. Not all of them,
not even most of them, but enough of them to be wounding.</p>

<p>They'll see the minimum self-promotion you <em>must</em> do to
hold mainstream attention in a media-saturated world, and they'll
mistake the means for the end -- they'll think you're about the
hype instead of the ideas you're hyping and savage you
unmercifully. They'll attack your methods. They'll impugn your
motives. You'll become the villain in more paranoid fantasies than
you knew human beings would utter in public. They'll treat your
successes as historical inevitability and crucify you for your
failures, and for failures they only imagine are yours.</p>

<p>And it <em>will</em> hurt. Even though you know with the top of
your brain that a lot of the hecklers are testosterone-poisoned
adolescents acting out at your expense. Even if you know that not
one in fifty of the back-seat drivers has anything like your coding
creds, not one in a hundred has the right personality type to fill
your shoes, and not any damn one of them has walked a mile in those
shoes. It will hurt.</p>

<p>Don't pity me -- I walked into this job with my eyes open. I
knew the road would wear on me. I expected some people on my own
side would damn near bury me in immaturity and bullshit. I knew
others would have the knives out for anything that looked for
accommodation with the mainstream, too; way too many hackers have
come to cherish their resentment of `the system' and developed a
sullen love of their own marginalization.</p>

<p>But don't have any illusions, either. It will happen to you,
too, no matter how good a job you do; you'll become a psychological
lightning rod for every conceivable neurosis about authority and
success.</p>

<p>The only way you'll pull through is if you truly believe the job
is more important than you are -- that the possibility of an
open-source software world means so much for human freedom and the
future that the worst shit anybody puts you through hardly matters
by comparison.</p>

<p>But even if you believe that, you <em>will</em> get deathly
weary of the shit.</p>

<p>Still want the job? Good. Here are the qualifications you'll
need:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>To be credible in the whole hacker community, you'll need a
track record of many years as a dedicated hacker, with multiple
successful projects under your belt and code in every Linux
distribution and the BSDs as well.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>You'll need excellent speaking and presentation skills. You must
be able to address both techies and suits in their own language at
length and hold their attention through exposition of complex and
novel ideas.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>You'll need an extroverted personality type to be able to think
on your feet, field hostile questions, and generate soundbytes on
demand.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>You'll need to have a knowledge base that includes computer
science, microeconomics and business practice, and more than a
touch of anthropology/sociology/psychology. Bonus points if you can
generate substantial research touching all these fields at
once.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>You'll need to be financially secure enough not to need to have
a regular job. (This one will give you some perks but no pay.)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>You'll need the personal trust of at least a solid majority of
the community's leaders. Relationships with many of them going back
years would be a valuable bonus.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>You'll need to know how to not frighten or turn off the
suits.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>You must have a thick skin, tremendous stamina, and a robust
sense of the absurd.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If you can meet these quals, please tell me and take my job
<em>now</em>. I want you to have it. I <em>need</em> someone else
to take it before I burn out. Show me competence and I'll back you
to the hilt. I'll hand you all my press contacts, make whatever
introductions are needed, and disappear offstage so fast your head
will spin. I'd love nothing better than to be able to retire and go
back to coding.</p>

<p>If you can't meet these quals, maybe you'd better think a bit
about whether you're helping get the job done or hindering it.
Which particular person is occupying the job at any given time is
not important -- but the job itself sure is. If we have a limited
number of possible incumbents and we burn them all out,
<em>all</em> of us will lose.</p>

<p>So if you can't lead and you won't follow, at least try not to
throw shit at the luckless bastard on the spot. Cut him a little
slack; after all, he's working for <em>you</em>.</p>
