<h2>Guidelines for reviewing <cite>The Art Of Unix Programming</cite>:</h2>

<p>When you send a review or correction, please cite the version
number.  The first printed edition is 1.0. If you're looking at the
on-line version, look at the most recent number in the version
history.</p>

<p>Try to batch up your error reports, especially the typos.  One
email with a lot of corrections in it is better than a dozen
single-character fixes.</p>

<p>Please cite chapters, sections, and examples by name rather than
number.  The chapter numbering has changed often enough during the
writing that references by number sometimes confuse me.</p>

<p>Please don't send just diffs against the HTML.  They don't map
well back to the XML in my masters, and they're hard to read.  A copy
of the text around the changed location, with the change called out,
is much more useful.</p>

<p>Suggest illustrations and pictures, appropriate diagrams and
charts. The book-design people like it when they can break up long dry
stretches of text with a visual.</p>

<p>If you think you have a better epigraph for any of the chapters,
do tell me. Also, I'm lacking sources and dates for some of the
quotes; if you can fill in an attribution, please do.</p>

<p>I'm also open to more case studies.  But don't just say "You
should mention project foo in the discussion of bar"; explain
<emphasis>why</emphasis> the software is a good case study, and 
what design principles and conventions it illustrates.  All
case studies must be open-source.  Small projects with clean code are
best, so they can easily be read.</p>

<p>The following are <emphasis>not</emphasis> errors.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>I use logical-style quoting in accordance with
established hacker custom, and I distinguish between single
&lsquo;philosopher's&rsquo; quotes for mentions and double
quotes for actual quotations.  If you think I have observed the
distinction incorrectly, correct me &mdash; but don't try to abolish
it in favor of the American double-quotes-only style, which I loathe. </p>

<p>(Yes, I'm an American.  So what?  I grew up in Europe.  I eat
with my fork in my left hand, bar my 7s, like metric measures, and
wince at mm/dd/yy dates too.  There are some things my country just
gets persistently wrong, alas.)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>There are some stylesheet problems. Notably, the Next entry in
the generated HTML for Appendix B points at the Bibliography section 
rather than Appendix B.  A couple of potential solutions turn out
to be worse than the problem.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Don't assume you've been ignored if you don't get a response;
that may just mean that your suggestions were obviously correct and
needed no comment. I tend not to reply to routine reports of
typos, in any case.</p>
