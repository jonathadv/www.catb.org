<h1>Corrections:</h1>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Bryce Kampjes point out: "In the section <cite>TCP/IP and the Unix
Wars: 1980-1990</cite> in the discussion about the emergence of the
386 there is no mention of the RISC machines. At the time, it did look
like the old x86 architecture was going to run out of steam, a 1
million transistor 486 could barely compete with 100,000 transistor
RISC chips. If that trend continued, then the x86 would have been
history. But the market could afford to throw large amounts of money
to make a bad architecture perform."</p>
</li>

<li><p>Graham J Lee: "I was quite surprised that the ultimate in
counter-examples, find(1), was not covered in depth as it was
applicable in a few places as a description of how UNIX programs
should *not* be done.  For instance, it contains code to mimic the
results of other UNIX programs, such as cpio or ls, when it could
easily have been combined with these programs via pipes and xargs.  It
also has a *very* non-standard interface, with X style option flags
despite having been created very early in the history of
UNIX."</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>Things to add, maybe:</h1>

<ul>
<li>
<p>There is a good article on X toolkit comparisons <a
href='http://freshmeat.net/articles/view/928'>here</a>.
</li>

<li>
<p>Diomedis Spinellis notes that an interesting case study for the
Interfaces chapter would be the addition of a GUI front-end to a
command-line driven debugger engine.  The front-end typically sends
commands to the debugger and interprets the response.  Dbxtool was an
early example, xgdb a follower.  He points to <a
href="http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/context/157910/0">this
paper</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Diomedis also notes: Another case where a shell script is preferable is when
it is used to construct a pipeline of commands that offer facilities not
typically available as part of a language library (it is getting more
difficult as time goes by to find such cases).  Consider:

<pre>
find ... |
while read i
do
        gzip -dc $i
done |
sed -e ... |
tsort |
join
</pre>

<p>He notes: "You can do find and sed in Perl and gunzip in Java, but
I have yet to see a topological sort or join function in a standard
library."</p> 
</li>

<li><p>Cite his <a
href='http://www.dmst.aueb.gr/dds/pubs/jrnl/1997-CSI-WinApi/html/win.html'>critique
of the Windows API.</p>  How much of this has changed since?</a>

<li>
<p>Here is an example for a new topic: how the fact that the shell
is an ordinary program, and can be invoked recusively, is helpful.</p>

<pre>
/usr/bin/script -c "PS1='script:\u@\h:\w\$ ' /bin/sh"
</pre>
</li>

<li>
<p>James Hunt's clever <a
href='http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-boot.html?ca=dgr-lnxw04BootFaster'>application
of make</a> to speeding up the Unix boot process could be a case study.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Cover <a href="http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/">asciidoc</a>.  A
very Unixy, lightweight solution to the document-markup problem which
might relegate DocBook to the role of a transport and interchange format.  </p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Cover <a href="http://www.yaml.org/">YAML</a>.  Nice lightweight
alternative to XML for structured-data interchange; the fact
that its data model is structures and sequences rather than 
attributed trees is interesting.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Rich Morin: "Other problems with shell as a programming language include
the difficulty of getting complex quoting combinations right
and the difficulty of passing multiple results back from a
script to its invoker."</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Rich Morin: "Part of the problem with C++ was commercial/sociological;
because the early developers couldn't agree on common, free
libraries, no standard libraries developed."</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Rich Morin: "Markup languages have a hidden benefit over WYSIWYG systems:
they allow (force, really) the author to examine the document in two different
formats. This helps to defeat the "snow blindness" that keeps authors from
spotting typos, etc."</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Rich Morin: "The discussion of POD neglects to mention that POD is capable
of being embedded in Perl.  This has been used to very good effect
in getting module authors to write (and maintain) manual pages."</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Rich Morin: "The discussion in section 19.3 should explain a bit about the
         Berne Convention's effect on documents which have NO explicit
         copyright notice.  In brief, they have a copyright which is
         too weak to be particularly useful, but strong enough to get
         in the way of the document's use by aggregators, open-source
         projects, etc."</p>
</li>

<li> 
<p>Yet another reason for transparent textual formats: someone,
somewhere, someday, is going to have to understand your format
without having the documentation for it.<p> 
</li>

<li> 
<p>Discuss JavaDoc as a significant benefit of Java.  (Done.)</p> 
</li>

<li> 
<p>In interface design, note that high variability in response latency
is worse than moderate but consistent response latency.</p> 
</li>

<li>
<p>Dr. David Alan Gilbert: "there should be a strong health warning
around 'Web browsers as the universal front end'.  Well it is true
that they can be very useful, they tend to be implemented in a way
which is harder to script.  In addition where the application is
implemented as a series of CGI scripts they place all the
computational load on the server.  I have recently seen a number of
examples of programmers used to php/web programming pushing all the
load onto a single web server when they all have respectably powerful
Unix boxen under their desks."</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>On the other hand, AJAX may make Dr. Gilbert's health warning obsolete...</p>
</li>

<li> 
<p>IBM is using GPL as an affirmative defense in the SCO lawsuit.  This
will require iminor revisions in the last section of the Re-Use chapter.</p>
