<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>I collect statistics on the Web usage of the terms "open source"
and "free software", and show evidence for the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Among software developers and in the technology trade press, use of the
term "open source" dominates use of the term "free software" by 95%-5% or
more.</li>
<li>On the general Web, the ratio is 80%-20% or more.</li>
<li>The gratis/libre ambiguity in the term "free software" produces
about an 80% false-positive rate in Web searches. After 20 years of
advocacy, "free software" is still effectively synonymous with
"freeware".</li>
<li>Use of the term "free software" is in long-term decline, and older or
obsolete pages form a larger part of its share than for "open source".
</ul>

<p>For a fast look at the results, go <a href='#results'>here</a>.</p>

<p>In this paper I take no position on what I believe <em>should</em> be the
case or what terminology people <em>should</em> use, I simply report what is.
The search URLs, methods, and data-reduction program I used are
included; readers are urged to perform their own tests to verify the
facts presented, and to assist in developing a more detailed and exact
picture.</p>

<p>This is the third revision, removing some historical statistics
that turned out to have been wrong, and with them the least-squares fit.
The second revision added the "Linux" vs. "GNU/Linux" sanity check and
the least-squares fit to the "free software" trend line.  The first
revision added more searches on Web media.</p>

<p>A cautionary note, 27 Oct 2004: Alex Fernandez has shown that the
results for SourceForge, Savannah, and news.com have false-positives
problems that call them into question.  We're working on refining these.</p>

<h1>Label, Label, Who's Got The Label?</h1>

<p>Recently, as I write at the beginning of July 2004, I've received
several queries, journalistic and otherwise, about the relative
frequency and importance of the terms "free software" and "open
source".  I never like giving speculative answers, so I put some
thought into the question of how to address that question in a factual
way.</p>

<p>I decided to perform a more rigorous and carefully-thought-out version
of an experiment I've done twice before: using the Web search engines
to perform statistical media content analysis on the Web.</p>

<p>Statistical content analysis is a well-understood tool in the
social sciences.  A representative example may be found in <a
href="http://www.agbiotechnet.com/pdfs/085199573x/085199573xCh18.pdf">
Time Series Analysis of Risk Frames in Media Communication of
Agrobiotechnology</a> (which shows up high on a Google search for
"media content analysis").  For my purposes, time series analysis
would be overkill &mdash; I am interested mainly in present-time
reality, not in how that reality evolved.  This paper is nevertheless
a useful example for its discussion of category framing, phrase
choice, and other methodological issues.</p>

<p>Here are a number of questions one might ask about these terms:</p>

<ol>
<li>Which term is more frequently used among software developers?</li>

<li>Which term is more frequently used in the news media?</li>

<li>Which term is more frequently used on the Web as a whole?</li>

<li>What percentage of users of either term recognize or are 
comfortable with both?</li>

<li>For each term, what percentage of its users are either unaware of
or choose not to use the other?</li> 
</ol>

<h1>Using Search Engines for Content Analysis</h1>

<p>For Web content analysis, the ideal tool would be one that allowed
specifying arbitrary Boolean combinations of words or phrases and
returned a hit count summed over the entire Web.  All real search
engines are more limited.  See <a
href='http://searchengineshowdown.com/'>Search Engine News</a> for
more detailed discussion.</p>

<p>It would be nice to use <a href="http://google.com">Google</a>,
simply because it has the largest database.  But Google's
Boolean-expression capabilities are limited, with no grouping and an
OR operator that is <a
href='http://www.searchengineshowdown.com/features/google/inconsistent.shtml'>inaccurate</a>.
Worse, though every Google search returns a hit count, the Google
documentation warns that these hit counts are not exact.  Furthermore
the total number of hits reported can vary depending on the number
of displayed hits you request!  This does not inspire confidence.</p>

<p>Thus, instead, I use <a href='http://search.yahoo.com'>Yahoo</a>,
with the second largest database but full Boolean capability. Their
hit counts are rounded and therefore almost certainly inaccurate, but
at least consistent.</p>

<h1>The Problem of False Positives</h1>

<p>A substantial problem with short phrases like "open source" and
"free software", especially those not containing proper nouns, is
false positives.</p>

<p>The phrase "open source" is relatively immune to false-positive
problems, as the only homographic usage is a relatively uncommon term
of art among intelligence specialists.  (In fact, the absence of
common conflicting usages was one of the minor criteria used to select
this term at the February 1998 meeting where it was brainstormed into
existence.)  Some noise (but probably not a great deal) is the use of
"open source" on pages like like <a
href='http://bcis.pacificu.edu/journal/2002/08/cooper.php'>this
one</a>, which use the phrase in a way inspired by the open-source
software movement but without reference to software or movement.</p>

<p>The phrase "free software" is more problematic, due to the
well-known gratis/libre ambiguity around the word "free".  It is an
observable fact that many Web references to "free software" are like
<a href='http://www.download.com/'>this one</a>, pointing to
shareware or gratis programs rather than source-available code
licensed under the Free Software Foundation's conditions.</p>

<p>Later in this paper I will measure and quantify the false-positive
effect.</p>

<h1>Methodology and Report Format</h1>

<p>In the remainder of this article, I experiment with various
qualifiers on the phrases "free software" and "open source".  In each
table, the first or 100% line is the set of all qualified matches
including either "free software" or "open source".  I take this to be
the universe of all relevant sites from the community of free software
and/or open-source developers (hereafter just "the community").</p>

<p>For each table, I deduce a noise level or statistical uncertainty
by looking at entries that should sum to 100%. If they don't, I take
the largest difference from 100% as the noise level.  We'll see that
the noise level is generally about 1%</p>

<p>I evaluated each qualifier for effectiveness at screening out false
positives by skimming the top hits.  Page ranking systems are a
powerful ally here, because people will take their language cues from
sites they consider authoritative.</p>

<p>I evaluated each qualifier for false negatives by looking at its effect
on line 2, the <b>"free software" AND "open source"</b> line.  My assumption 
is that all these are community sites, and that a qualifier which depresses
this figure by more than noise level has a false-negatives problem.</p>

<p>For purposes of this analysis, a good qualifier is one which reduces
false positives by more than noise level and does not increase false
negatives by more than noise level.</p>

<p>I've made the search strings in all my tables live links, so you
can easily gather current numbers yourself.  Your retrievals will
change over time, but probably not to where they aren't recognizably
related to what you see here.</p>

<h1>Developer Usage</h1>

<p>To assay present developer usage of these terms, I decided to begin with a
site search on <a href='http://sourceforge.net'>SourceForge</a>.
SourceForge is the largest repository of open-source and free software
in the world.  This means that any uses of our probe phrases are very
likely to be real, e.g. natural utterances by the community we are
examining.  In particular, on SourceForge "free software" reliably 
means libre rather than gratis.  We don't need to experiment with
qualifiers here.</p>

<p>In the absence of any reason to believe that the SourceForge
user population is systematically biased towards one term or the
other, the fact that SourceForge is the largest such site probably
makes it the best possible site for our purposes.</p>

<p>Here is our first set of numbers.  Each row gives hit counts for
the Yahoo search specified on the left.  The second number is a
percentage of the relevant universe.</p>

<br />

<p>On SourceForge, at least, use of the term "free software" has
declined to where it is barely distinguishable from this noise
level.</p>

<p>I found these numbers rather startling.  So much though that I had
to investigate the possibility that the "free software" crowd had
decamped en masse to elsewhere.</p>

<p>The obvious candidate was <a
href='http://savannah.gnu.org'>Savannah</a>, a SourceForge-like site
set up by the Free Software Foundation specifically for those who became
ideologically unhappy with SourceForge after its maintaining organization
degenerated from an open-source company to a proprietary shop.  So I
did the same sort of site search:</p>

<br />

<p>The universe population of both these sites (33,350 pages) is
comparable to the noise level in Yahoo's SourceForge numbers.  If
there is any population of pages still using the term "free software"
that is significant in size relative to the whole community's output,
we aren't going to find it here.  (I looked at ibiblio.org, which was
the largest repository before SourceForge, but it was an order of
magnitude smaller than Savannah.)</p>

<h1>News Media Usage</h1>

<p>To assess news-media usage, I ran site-specific searches on
several major Internet news organizations.  I started with
two of the leading technology trade press sites:</p>

<p>The picture revealed by skimming these search results is simple.
Use of the term "free software" is rare in the technology press and
mainly associated with older stories.  Of Yahoo's top four news.com
hits on <b>"free software" AND NOT "open source"</b> at time of
writing, two are from early 1998, one is a false positive from
Microsoft with "Piracy-Free Software" in the title, and the fourth is
an FSF-originated advocacy piece.</p>

<p>I then tried to find similarly large samples from general media,
without success.  It appears that neither the Reuters wire service
nor the Associated Press wire service nor the Wall Street Journal nor
MSNBC make their archives accessible by search engines.</p>

<h1>Whole-Web Usage</h1>

<p>Now it's time to look at the Web as a whole.  First, a search with 
no attempt to screen out false positives for either term:</p>

<p>It seems that "open source" tops "free software", by a 16% margin,
well over statistical noise level, even with the shareware/freeware
pages left in.  But how to filter them out for a more accurate
picture?</p>

<p>Excluding all sites that mention "shareware" seems like an obvious
first step:</p>

<br />

<p>This makes a 3% difference, which is just above noise level.  But
examining the first 1000 actual hits by hand tells us something else,
which is that pages mentioning "open source" and "shareware" are
effectively always community pages whether or not they mention "free
software", whereas pages <em>not</em> mentioning "open source" but
mentioning "shareware" are effectively never community pages.  That
is, <b>NOT shareware</b> is a good filter for "free software" but not
for "open source". </p>

<p>Inversely, there is from these results exactly one good qualifier for 
the phrase "open source".  It is the absence of the phrase 
"open source intelligence", which shows up with about 1% frequency on sites
relating to espionage and intelligence.</p>

<p>So here is our third pass:</p>

<br />

<p>Looking at the top 1000 <b>"free software" AND NOT "open source" AND NOT
shareware</b> hits by hand still shows a lot of binary-download and other
pages irrelevant for our purposes.  I searched diligently for other
qualifiers that would identify non-community pages, checking obvious
candidates like "download" and "freeware" first, but did not find any
that were good by the standard I previously described.</p>

<p>So how much of that 44% is junk?  To address this question, we need
to get a better handle on the vulnerability of both phrases to false 
positives.</p>

<h1>Estimating False Positives</h1>

<p>On 1 July 2004 I looked through the top 1000 Yahoo hits for each of
the four searches in Table 8 for false positives.  I considered a page
a positive if either (a) some use of one of the phrases "open source"
or "free software" referred to software released under a license
conforming to the Open Source Definition or documentation released
under either GFDL or Creative Commons licenses, or (b) the page
contained a clear and intentional reference to the open-source or
free-software movements.  For the benefit of anyone interested in
running their own statistical analysis, <a href='hitstats.py'>here</a>
is both the raw false-positives list (collected by hand) and the Python
program I used for reducing the data below; the absolute numbers won't
stay valid for long because page ranks shift, but you can analyze the
distribution.</p>

<p>Here is the output of report_false_positives(), a table of running
averages showing how false-positive percentages vary with page rank in the
top 1000 hits:</p>

<caption>Table 9: Running average of false-positive counts in top 1000.</caption>
<br/>

<p>This table can be summarized as follows:</p>

<ol>

<li>The A search, <b>("open source" AND NOT "open source
intelligence") OR ("free software" AND NOT shareware)</b> has a rate
of false positives below 1% noise level and trending down as page rank
decreases.</li>

<li>The B search, <b>("open source" AND NOT "open source intelligence") AND
("free software" AND NOT shareware)</b> has a rate of false positives
below 1% noise level and trending down as page rank decreases.</li>

<li>The C search, <b>("open source" AND NOT "open source
intelligence")</b>, has a rate of false positives that is below 1% noise
level, varying erratically.</li>

<li>The D search, <b>("free software" AND NOT shareware)</b> has a rate of
false positives of about 67%, trending gradually upwards as page rank 
falls.</li>

<li>The E search, <b>("open source" AND NOT "open source intelligence")
AND NOT ("free software" AND NOT shareware)</b>, has false positives
below noise level and trending gradually downwards as page rank falls.</li>

<li>The F search, <b>"free software" AND NOT ("open source" AND NOT
"open source intelligence") AND NOT shareware</b>, has a rate of false
positives of 81%, rising as page rank drops.</p>
</ol>

<p>All the variations in false-positive rate except A are readily
explained by the combination of a very high false-positive rate for
"free software" and a very low one for "open source".  And A turns
out to be an artifact resulting from the way Yahoo reports
alternations.  All hits for the first search key in an alternation get
listed first; thus, since we specified "open source" first, the false
positives are buried out of sight below pagerank 1000.  On the other
hand, had we listed "free software" first, the false-positive count in
the first 1000 would have been artificially high.</p>

<p>Should we believe that these false-positive rates will maintain over
millions of lower-ranked pages?  The best reason to do so is that they
are all explained by a simple theory: the combination of "open source"
and "free software" has effectively no false positives, "open source"
alone has them at below noise level, and "free software" has many.
Composing these keys yields intermediate cases.</p>

<p>Now let's correct the numbers in Table 8 by adjusting for false 
positives.  There is just one tricky bit here.  Since we can't rely on
the false-positive rate for A, we have to estimate an A' hit count
by adding together the adjusted B, E, and F numbers.  A'=100% gets used
to calculate the percentages in the second column.  We can also use
it to deduce the rate of false positives in the A set.</p>

<p>Note that because the A, B, C and E sets are large relative to the
D and F sets, any error in the estimated rate of false positives would
have to be large to swing the ajusted numbers significantly.</p>

<p>There were few enough true-positive search-F hits in the top 1000
(less than 200) that I could review them more closely.  This turned up
another interesting statistic: just about 50% were project pages
written by developers, as opposed to advocacy papers or journalism or
academic research or weblogging.  Therefore, we can estamate that half
of F (4.5% of the whole-Web hits) count as developer pages using the term
"free software" exclusively.</p>

<h1>Linux vs. GNU/Linux</h1>

<p>After I published the first version of this paper, a friend
suggested that I run the same sort of cross-check on "Linux"
vs. "GNU/Linux". His theory was that this could provide an independent
check on the distribution of the same ideological positions, without
requiring any significant correction for false positives.  The null
hypothesis is to expect the incidence ratio of these terms to track
the incidence ratio of "open source" vs. "free software", because the
FSF's campaign for the term "free software" is accompanied by an
exhortation to use the term "GNU/Linux" rather than plain "Linux".</p>

<p>If these numbers do not track, then either (a) the communities that
use the second set of terms are not strongly correlated with the
communities that use the first set of terms, or (b) we need to look at
our methhodology for filtering false positives more suspiciously.</p>

<p>Interpreting this as a sanity check on the previous numbers, we
seem to pass. None of these results are surprising.</p>

<p>The SourceForge and news.com ratios track the corresponding "open
source"vs. "free software" ratios to within 1%, actually more
precisely than the noise level of the probes.  There is a very slight
difference downward, which would be consistent with the theory that
the FSF has been slightly less effective at promoting the "GNU/Linux"
label than the "free software" label.  This is consistent with the
historical record; they only began promoting the "GNU/Linux" label in
the mid-1990s, compared to 1983 for "free software".  The alternative
is that, if anything, we are underestimating the false-positive
problems of "free software".</p>

<h1>Statistical Interpretation</h1>

<p>Use of the term "free software" within the developer community has
receded to the point where it is, at D = 3% (nonexclusive use) and F =
2% (exclusive use), barely distinguishable from statistical noise.
The only alternative to this interpretation is to suppose both that
the population of the largest repository site in the world is hugely
biased by unknown factors <em>and</em> that the Free Software
Foundation has been unsuccessful at attracting more than a tiny
percentage of "free software" partisans to Savannah.  This alternative
is rendered very unlikely by other evidence summarized below.</p>

<p>Use of the term "free software" has dropped to the same D = 3%, F =
2%, near noise level, in the Web-accessible technical press, and in
the hand-inspected top hits seems primarily associated with older
articles.</p>

<p>Use of the term "free software" on the general Web is at D
= 20%, F = 9%, and exclusive use on project pages written by software
developers is about 4.5%. The latter figure is close enough to the
SourceForge F = 2% to suggest that SourceForge is in fact
representative of the whole-Web developer population.</p>

<p>F for the Savannah sites accounts for about 1% of the A in Table
10.  Because we know that F = 4.5% for developers on the Web as a
whole, this suggests that the Savannah have recruited about one fifth
of their target population of partisans for the term "free software",
with SourceForge's F accounting for another two fifths, leaving at most
two fifths unaccounted for on the rest of the Web.</p>

<p>A for SourceForge is about 7% of A for the whole Web.  Given that a
significant fraction of Web hits on "open source" are journalism, this
suggests that SourceForge has captured more than 7% of open-source
developer activity. (Other estimates have run as high as 33%.)</p>

<p>The phrase "open source" standing alone does not have a significant
level of false positives when used to probe for Web traces of
open-source software activity, advocacy, and journalistic
coverage. The phrase "free software", on the other hand, does have a
significant false-positives problem, at or above the 80% level, 
mostly or entirely due to the gratis/libre ambiguity.</p>

<p>Web-usage frequency of the term "free software" relative to "open
source" continues to exhibit a long-term decline from a trivially 100%
incidence of "free software" before the "open source" label was
launched in 1998.  The rate is difficult to quantify, but we know that
"free software" has lost 80% of web share in six years, suggesting an
annual drop of about 13% per year.  However, the decay curve is more
likely exponential, asymptotically approaching some nonzero stable
population at or below the current 9%.</p>

<p>Previous versions of this paper showed rough Google statistics
from 2001 and 2002, but a reviewer pointed out that those numbers were
not internally consistent.  Why, we don't know.  Google hit counts are
known to be fuzzy.  Nevertheless, they suggested that the term "free
software" has been in long-term decline.</p>

<p>So far, I have only written about the statistics of page hits.
However, it would be surprising if these did not track preferences in
the community population.  They can fail to do so only if on average
users of the term "free software" differ from users of the term "open
source" in their propensity to write Web pages.  One of the behavioral
traits indexed by use of the term "free software" is more tendency
towards ideological banner-waving; this is demonstrated by (among many
other facts) the existence of Savannah, which has a purely ideological
<em>raison d'&ecirc;tre</em>.  Thus, the most likely direction of bias
is that "open source" is underrepresented by developer-web-page hits
than overrepresented.</p>

<h1>Unanswered Questions</h1>

<p>These results indicate that the term "free software" retains much
more presence on the Web as a whole (D = 20%, E = 9%) than it does
among developers on SourceForge or at news.com (both D = 3%, E = 2%).
What hypotheses might account for this almost order-of-magnitude
difference?</p>

<p>One theory would start from the fact that "free software" has been
a live term for the entire post-1990 lifespan of the Web, while "open
source" was introduced only in 1998.  Developer pages associated with
live SourceForge projects get touched relatively often (due to release
announcements, etc.) while on the general Web static content such as
academic papers may remain untouched for indefinite periods.  Are most
"free software" mentions on the general Web holdovers from olden
days?</p>

<p>While this hypothesis is attractively simple, it is difficult to
test rigorously.  Yahoo and Google offer only crude date filtering
(last three months, last six months, last year).  The Wayback
Machine's recall facility is still in beta.  The top trade-press hits
indicate that the 20% probably does include a disproportionate number of
older pages, but this is unlikely to be the whole story.</p>

<p>Another theory is that whole-Web statistic reflects the language of
some population not represented on SourceForge or in the
technology-press sites I surveyed.  The most obvious candidates are
community evangelists and academics.  Because the choice of "open
source" vs. "free software" is perceived as a political issue within
the hacker community, evangelists and academics often try to reinforce
their impartiality by using both terms.  13% out of that 20% has this
pattern.</p>

<p>Some of these questions could be answered by a more fine-grained
content analysis that would try to identify hits by type, sorting them
as project pages, advocacy, journalism, and so forth. That would be 
a valuable next step.</p>
