>I always build with two disks &#8212; one "system" disk and one
"home" disk.  There are two good reasons to do this that have nothing to do
with the extra capacity.  One of them is the performance advantage of being
able to interleave commands to different physical spindles that we
discussed above.  The other is I am quite a bit less likely to lose two
disks at once than I am to trash a single one.</P
><P
>Let's suppose you have a fatal disk crash.  If you have only one
disk, goodbye Charlie.  If you have two, maybe the crashed one was your
system disk, in which case you can buy another and mess around with a new
Linux installation knowing your personal files are safe.  Or maybe it was
your home disk; in that case, you can still run and do recovery stuff and
basic Net communications until you can buy another home disk and restore it
from backups (you <I
