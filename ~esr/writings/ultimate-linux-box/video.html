>For our ULB, we want as many pixels as we can get on screen.  There
are factors other than the price that have a strong liveability impact,
however.  A major one is the sheer amount of space big monitors take up.
It's not a dream system if the display tube won't fit on your desk!</P
><P
>Flatscreens should be a lot more friendly, but no flatscreen
available in July 2001 can match the 2048x1536 resolution of the
highest-end conventional monitors.  Today's flatscreens also have a really
coarse dot pitch with sharp square pixels.  As far as I'm concerned, that
puts them right out of the running for the ULB.  I do a lot of writing and,
not infrequently, my own typesetting; I want to be able to preview two
pages of Postscript at actual size and have the fonts look good.</P
><P
>For serious, day-in/day-out use, 21-inch monitors are still the right
thing.  While larger monitors exist, they are designed for room-display
rather than personal use; they too have coarser resolution.</P
><P
>(But the trend curves are clear -- I do expect that within a year
from now flatscreens will have surged past monitors in capability.  2002's
Ultimate Linux Box, if I design one, will probably sport a
flatscreen.)</P
><P
>You should actually see the monitor you're contemplating before you
buy it.  A factory flaw like serious edge misconvergence or a tilted yoke
is not a happy thing to discover after you've already cut a check.</P
><P
>Next, buy your card.  The major issue here is matching the
card to the capacity of your monitor -- you don't want to buy a card
and find it can't drive your monitor at its maximum capability.  If
(unlike us) you're economizing, you also don't want to pay for more
card than your monitor can use.</P
><P
>So once you've specified your monitor, find a video card with a
maximum video bandwidth equal to or just slightly higher than the
monitor's.  That's how you know your video system is properly
balanced, with a minimum of wasted capacity.</P
