<p>Understand my job, please!</p>

<p>Three days ago (28 Mar 1999) I posted <a
href="take-my-job-please.html">Take My Job, Please!</a>.  Though I
didn't intend that essay as an psychological probe of the Internet
culture, the reaction to it has made an interesting study in how
people refract and interpret communications in the light of their own
agendas, preoccupations, and desires.</p>

<p>The most interesting revelation to me was the speed with which many
people leapt to the assumption that I have already burnt out, given
up, folded my tent, and stolen off into the night.  While I certainly
expressed a desire to have my own life back and stop taking arrows
from the Slashdot kiddies and their spiritual kin, I also stated rather
clearly that I <em>cannot</em> in good conscience retire without 
a replacement (or multiple replacements) ready to pick up my job.</p>

<p>So let me be very explicit about it.  That essay was not intended to
announce my retirement as a decision already made; it was intended as
a wake-up call.  As a culture, we have a nasty habit of eating our own
&mdash; of demanding unattainable perfection, of assuming the worst, of
flaming before thinking.  This has to stop.  <em>We've got to grow
up.</em> Whether it's me or somebody else in this week's hot seat, we
don't generate so many successful advocates and leaders that we can
afford to waste them.  Our habit of doing that was one of the things
that kept us marginal and weak for so long.  We need to grow new ones
faster and be a little less savage at the ones we have.</p>

<p>And I'm not just speaking of myself by any means &mdash; I think I could
name a dozen valuable people over the last ten years who burned out
and left us because they tried to tough it out.  They reached
<em>their</em> limits without sending out a distress signal as I just
did.  I can name another four that have been pushed nearly over the
edge more than once, and whose stressout levels we'd better be damn
careful about if we want to keep them around.  One of those people is
Linus Torvalds.</p>

<p>Nor is burning out your front people the only bad effect of abusing
them.  It's easy for some people to talk glibly about replacing me
with a <a
href="http://web.archive.org/web/20001120132300/www.perens.com/Articles/Evangelist.html">gang
of ten</a>, but I doubt even <em>one</em> other person sufficiently in
his right mind to qualify will ever volunteer if the job conditions
don't improve.  Why should he when by doing something else he can get
paid and have a life and neither have to worry about satisfying forty
thousand conflicted idealists nor have to listen to
testosterone-poisoned twerps ranting &ldquo;who elected you?&rdquo; or
&ldquo;your ego is out of control&rdquo;?</p>

<p>Earlier I used the word &lsquo;leader&rsquo; &mdash; something I
avoided in the previous essay, because I don't think of myself as a
leader.  Advocate, yes; philosopher/theoretician, yes; ambassador,
yes; even a bit of a merry prankster, yes &mdash; I'm good at those
things.  But I've always resisted attempts to turn me into a
&lsquo;leader&rsquo;.  My job, the job I've been doing one way or
another ever since picking up the <a
href="http://www.catb.org/jargon">Jargon File</a> in 1990, is to
describe and explain and reflect the values of the tribe of hackers.
Not to lead it &mdash; that's an impossible job, and I wouldn't want
it if it were possible.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, a fair number of people insisted in calling on me in
public to stop trying to lead, and to argue about whether and what
kind of leadership we need.  I thought these arguments revealed much
more about the preoccupation of the people making them with power
issues than they did about anything I've ever said or done. As the old
Zen Comix punchline goes, &ldquo;I left that woman at the riverside; are
you still carrying her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ironically, the part of my job that most resembles
&lsquo;leadership&rsquo; (the presidency of OSI) is probably the part
that makes the fewest demands on my endurance.  Negotiating with Apple
about APSL 1.1 changes (something I'm still involved in doing) is much
easier than reading yet another screed about the inherent evil of APSL
1.0, or dealing with my sixth press call of the day, or spending two
weeks a month on the road.</p>

<p>And let's talk about the APSL.  A lot of people jumped to the
conclusion that the public flap over it was a major cause of my
distress.  There is a connection, but it's not the obvious one.  I
wasn't much injured by learning that many people thought the license
was broken and OSI had made a wrong call &mdash; I've got a bit more courage
than to collapse over that, it just meant OSI had a duty to re-examine
and maybe re-negotiate.  What did rather dishearten me was two bad
things about the way the flap developed.  And those two things are
behaviors our culture needs to learn not to repeat:</p>

<ol>
<li> <p>People who should have known better
(<a href="http://linuxtoday.com/stories/4179.html">Perens/Akkerman/Jackson</a>,
<a href="http://linuxtoday.com/stories/4263.html">RMS</a>) threw bombs
in public instead of approaching OSI and Apple privately with their
concerns.</p>

<li> <p>A lot of other people immediately went flaming paranoid berserk,
ignored <a href="http://linuxtoday.com/stories/4240.html">OSI's
response</a>, and accused me of personally masterminding a plot to
sell out the hacker tribe to greedy corporate exploiters.</p>
</ol>

<p>What's the disturbing thing here?  Nobody who went public took time
out for ten deep breaths.  Instead, our stalwart would-be defenders of
cultural purity splintered the community, stirred up needless trouble,
and made negotiations with Apple to fix the APSL's problems much more
difficult &mdash; without accomplishing anything more for anybody than if
they had asked a few quiet questions of OSI first.</p>

<p>In fact, none of those stalwarts developed any more constructive
response than an electronic lynching bee directed at the handiest
scapegoat.  And that <em>did</em> hurt.  If you don't trust the people
who put their effort and their reputations on the line for you even
long enough to politely ask &lsquo;what's up with that?&rsquo; before
going for the ideological knives, those people aren't going to work
for you very long. </p>

<p>But the real reason I'm making an issue of this is not personal &mdash;
it's because we need to learn not to pull this kind of immature crap
in public any more.  The stakes are too high now; when we squabble
like children, the trade and even the <em>mainstream</em> press will
pick up on it and nail us as a bunch of fractious flakes who can't
even be trusted on the playground without a keeper, much less to
define the computing infrastructure of the next century.  And if we
don't learn how to handle our internal conflicts with more grace and
discretion, they'll be <em>right</em> to nail us and we <em>will</em>
blow our chances.</p>

<p>So the things we need to do to avoid burning out our spokespeople and
leaders are the same things we need to do to look like sane, credible,
responsible adults to the non-hacker world.  You know, that's 
not a coincidence....</p>

<p>So, what am I going to do next?</p>

<p>First, I want to thank all of the literally hundreds of people who
sent me supportive email, including more than a few who apologized for
making my job needlessly difficult or failing to speak up when other
people did.  Those apologies mattered to me.  The flamers and twits
had nearly managed to make me forget that they're a minority.  Even
the Slashdot thread about <a href="take-my-job-please.html">Take My
Job, Please!</a> was almost 50% supportive, which I found amazing.</p>

<p>Next, I'm going to take a vacation.  And after that, cut back on my
speaking and press schedule.  Under the circumstances, I was just as
happy to learn yesterday that <em>Wired</em> has canceled the full
biography they were going to do on me next month.  Their reason?  I've
been getting &ldquo;too much national and international press&rdquo;
&mdash; I'm overexposed.  I agree.  Time to relax a little, recharge
my batteries, write some code, hang with my wife, play with our cat,
put a few hundred rounds of hardball through the .45, and finish my
paper on open-source economics and business models.</p>

<p>I'm not resigning from OSI, though.  We'll continue to work with Apple
and anyone else in the corporate world who genuinely wants to join the
hackers' game.  Most of the time that work will be quiet negotiation
behind the scenes (as it is right now).  Occasionally it will be very
public.  I'll be working on training a successor, and I'll bow out in
that person's favor when the time is right.</p>

<p>I will <em>not</em> give up on our tribe.  For more than twenty years
now I've dreamed of living in a whole world of software that doesn't
suck &mdash; clean, powerful, reliable, well-built code that we techies can
love and be proud of instead of cursing because it's all so flaky and
broken and sad.  An infrastructure that gives people choices rather
than ulcers, freedom instead of monopoly lock-in.  I think the
open-source model is our best shot at getting there, and I believe in
the capacity of the hacker culture, coupled with the free market, to
make it work.  We <em>can</em> win; we can make the world a profoundly
better place.  We <em>have</em> the brains and character to do it &mdash;
if we insist on the best from ourselves not in our relationships with
technology but in our relationships with each other as well.</p>

<p>Work on your kindness.  Work on your trust.  When you see twits going
on a rampage, speak up against it without descending to their level.
Try to be forbearing, not just towards me and your other advocates
and leaders (though we sure need it, we're human beings too and
responsibility is heavy) but towards each other as well.  The energy
we spend on fighting each other is energy we're <em>not</em> spending
on our work.  We owe the world better; we've got a big job to do
together.  Let's get on with it.</p>
