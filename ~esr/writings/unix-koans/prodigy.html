of a prodigiously gifted programmer, a young man who wandered the length and
breadth of the land performing mighty feats of coding and humiliating all
who dared set their skill against his.</p><p>Eventually this prodigy came to visit Master Foo, who received him 
politely and offered him tea.  The Prodigy accepted with equal politeness
and explained the motive for his visit.</p><p><span class="quote">“<span class="quote">I have come to you,</span>”</span> he said <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">seeking a code
and design review of my latest project.  For it is of surpassing
complexity, and I do not have peers capable of understanding it.  Only
an acknowledged master such as yourself (and here the Prodigy bowed
deeply) can have the discernment required.</span>”</span></p><p>Master Foo bowed politely in return and began examining the
Prodigy's code.  After some time he raised his eyes from the screen.
<span class="quote">“<span class="quote">This code is at first sight very impressive,</span>”</span> he
said. <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">It is elegant in design, utilizing original algorithms of
great ingenuity, and appears to be implemented in a craftsmanlike way
which minimizes the possibility of errors.</span>”</span></p><p>The Prodigy looked very pleased at this praise, but Master Foo
continued: <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">However, I detect one significant flaw.</span>”</span></p><p><span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Flaw?</span>”</span> the Prodigy said. <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">What
flaw?</span>”</span></p><p><span class="quote">“<span class="quote">This code is difficult to read,</span>”</span> said Master
Foo. <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">It is only thinly commented, its invariants are not
specified, and I see no narrative description of its architecture or
internal data structures anywhere.  These problems will seriously
impede your cooperation with other programmers.</span>”</span></p><p>The Prodigy drew himself up haughtily. <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">I do not seek the
cooperation of other programmers,</span>”</span> he said. <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Every time I
thought I had found one who might match me in skill I have been
disappointed. Thus, I work alone.</span>”</span></p><p><span class="quote">“<span class="quote">But even the hacker who works alone,</span>”</span> said Master
Foo, <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">collaborates with others, and must constantly communicate
clearly to them, lest his work become confused and lost.</span>”</span></p><p><span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Of what others do you speak?</span>”</span> the Prodigy demanded.</p><p>Master Foo said: <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">All your future selves.</span>”</span></p><p>Upon hearing this, the Prodigy was enlightened.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="end-user.html"><img src="images/prev.png" alt="Prev" /></a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="hardware-designer.html"><img src="images/next.png" alt="Next" /></a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Master Foo and the End User </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html"><img src="images/home.png" alt="Home" /></a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Master Foo and the Hardware Designer</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
