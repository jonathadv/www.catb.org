				xmlif

xmlif is a tool that interprets certain processing instructions in XML
documents to support conditional emission of specified sections of the
document.  It is intended to be used as a stage in an XML toolchain.

Note: if you have Tim Waugh's xmlto(1) installed, you already have an
older version of xmlif that is, sadly, incompatiblw wuth this one. It
used "xmlif" rather than "maybe" to introduce conditionals, which turns
out to be forbidden by XML standards language.

Run "make check" to test xmlif.
